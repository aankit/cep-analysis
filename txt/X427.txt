Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

School’s Mission  

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

The Community School for Social Justice is an active and caring learning community. Young people learn to solve and 
resolve, collaborate and create, and develop the intellectual and social skills to become thoughtful and engaged 
members of their communities. We honor each student’s heritage and values. We embrace a climate of social 
activism in which our students feel the confidence to address issues that affect their lives; we help them connect their 
desires with hope and possibility; and we provide the emotional and academic supports students need to earn a high

school diploma and be successful in life. At CSSJ, we place an emphasis on developing critical thinking through inquiry 
and project-based instruction. By understanding how to ask questions and examine real-life problems young people 
learn to consider solutions that are both practical and ideal. As students grow, learn, and reflect, we strive to guide 
them toward a sense of power and personal discovery to make change for themselves, for their own futures, and for 
the world in which they live.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The Community School for Social Justice has 325 students from grade 9 through grade 12. The school population 
comprises 25% Black, 73% Hispanic, 1% White & 1% other. The student body includes 15% English language learners 
and 25% special education students. Boys account for 48% of the students enrolled and girls account for 52%. The 
average attendance rate for the school year 2017-2018 was 76.70%. We have 80% of students who qualify for free or 
reduced lunch. 

Major Partnerships: 

Curriculum, Instruction and Professional Development: 

Our school is a member school of the NY Performance Standards Consortium . We are one of 47 schools approved by 
the NYS Department of Education to graduate students through a performance task assessment system in lieu of 
taking the Regents exams in Math, Science, Global Studies and US History. As such, we have a common belief that is 
shared by both Consortium schools and by the staff in our school, about effective teaching and learning. This drives 
our assessments, curriculum development and instruction. The assessment rubrics that we use to assess the students’ 
culminating performance based assessment tasks (PBATs) in Math, Social Studies, Science and English are ones that 
are used by every Consortium school. Before we hire teachers, we invite them for a visit and interview in which we 
explain what it means to be a Consortium school and to be a teacher in a Consortium school. We also conduct 
professional development training for both new and experienced teachers to help their practice and assessments 
align to Consortium expectations. Our teachers attend and facilitate Consortium teacher workshops during the year 
and visit other Consortium schools as part of developing our shared understanding how students learn best. 

We have completed our fourth year as a PROSE school. The primary focus of our partnership is around our re-
designed teacher evaluation system. In this system, we have implemented a teacher pedagogical practice goal setting 
process, which involves multiple discussions between individual teachers and administrators and between individual 
teachers and peers. In this process there is an initial goal setting conference, progress updates throughout the year 
with peers, a mid-year monitoring meeting with administrators and a summative goal setting evaluation in which 
teachers present the teacher portfolios they have created to demonstrate the work they have done to successfully 
meet their professional practice goal. As well, there are organized classroom inter-visitations between colleagues. 

Another significant partnership is with the NYC Outward Bound Expeditionary Learning (EL) organization. We became 
an associate school in the spring of 2016. Philosophically, CSSJ and EL are well-aligned. We are making good use of 
their coaching staff to support our three year curriculum and instructional shifts plan. Their expertise in curriculum 
design and pedagogical practices support our staff efforts as we deepen our work around designing courses with 
worthy themes, strong and relevant guiding questions and case studies, meaningful field work, and assessments that 
are aligned to guiding questions and educational outcomes.  

Another important partnership is with Ramapo for Children, a non-profit organization that provides services to 
support our restorative justice program, including an RJ coach who is on-site 1-2 days a week to support the 
development and implementation of our: 100% Respect campaign, peer mediation program, restorative chats 
process, community norms expectations and our reintegration program. As well, they provide coaching support to our 
family group advisors in the areas of facilitation of circles, use of RJ and community building curriculum, and 
facilitation of an advisory; and they provide talented staff to lead parent workshops. In addition, teaching support is 
provided by their academic coach on a bi-weekly basis with 6 teachers.

Arts: 

We have a long-standing partnership with Manhattan Theatre Club . A theatre educator from MTC partners with our 
12th grade teacher to co-plan and teach a theatre writing course for six weeks during which time our students 
produce one act plays that are performed by MTC actors in a school production. They read a play currently in 
production at MTC’s theatre and they attend a performance. Students are highly engaged in this program which 
strengthens their writing skills and introduces them to the world of theatre. 

Furthermore, this is our second year partnership with Tectonic Theatre Project. This program is a play writing 
workshop for our 11th graders that uses the exploration of social justice, interviews, Moment Work training, and 
writing to create short original works. The original works by students, is presented by professional actors for the 
school community after which there will be a facilitated discussion between audience members, student playwrights 
and performers. 
 
In addition, this is our fourth year of a partnership with the "Open Doors" Theatre Program. Theatre Development 
Fund's "Open Doors" program and is a Tony Award-winning program that pairs a distinguished theater professional 
with a high school teacher to mentor a group of eight students every year.  

Corporate - Career and College Mentoring: 

Through our PENCIL collaboration, we are celebrating our seventh year of partnership with the consulting and 
financial services/accounting/consulting firm of Deloitte. This partnership has grown from an annual Impact Day 
college and career preparation full day event for our junior class, to include Deloitte Academy, the college and career 
readiness program in which students in grades 9 - 12 meet twice monthly on Friday afternoons with mentors from 
Deloitte to develop career and college readiness skills. Students research colleges, talk to the mentors about the skills 
and habits necessary for success in college and careers, visit colleges and participate in presentations and career-
related activities at the Deloitte Manhattan offices, create and present business plans, and learn how to use social 
media responsibly. An addition to the partnership is a college scholarship program that began five years ago and has 
distributed $47,000 in scholarships to CSSJ Deloitte Academy recipients. 

University and College: 

This upcoming year we have established a partnership with Lehman College to commence "Shadow Day", a 
community service event lead by Chi Alpha Epsilon (XAE) through the SEEK Program. The program will build a 
collaborative partnership and establish a rapport with CSSJ students. The goal is to engage our students to college life 
experiences through interactive workshops. Furthermore, the goal is to also provide students with an opportunity to 
understand that attending college is a realistic goal and achieving a degree is attainable for all students. 

Over the years we have also partnered with several colleges and universities to train student teachers at our school. 
They include: Barnard, Lehman , and Teachers’ College . As well, we partner with New York University and Lehman 
College to train social worker interns. 

Community 

The Morris Heights Health Center is another valuable partner. They operate the school-based clinic in our campus, 
and in addition to medical services, they provide both health educator and mental health services to our students. As 
well, five years ago the then CEO and President of Morris Heights Health Center and Foundation and the recently 
retired principal of CSSJ partnered to create a scholarship program to provide financial support for students who want 
to go away to college, but who cannot do this without additional financial assistance. To date, 28 CSSJ students have 
received scholarships from MMHC's foundation in total of over $247,000! . Our first scholarship recipient graduated 
from Ithaca College and is enrolled in a Masters program at Seton Hall University. Of the remaining 28 students, 9 are 
enrolled to attend a university in the fall 0f 2018, and 17 are currently successfully enrolled in colleges, with 15 of

those students in schools outside of NYC and two in NYC CUNY colleges. The remaining student is serving in the armed 
forces after successfully completing one year of college.  

The NYPD Explorer's Program is a community-based partnership that is entering its 3rd year. Students participate in 
team building and community activities and events with NYPD officers as mentors and leaders. They learn the 
fundamentals of community-based policing practices and are mentored by police officers who participate in this 
program. The program meets weekly at the school and students also participate in off-site community service events 
including marching in city parades and attending workshops and conferences and conducting community service trips 
throughout the south Bronx.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Each year, 90 - 95% of our students live in poverty. An increasing number of our students live in temporary housing. 
The number of ACS cases reported in the last three years are greatly increased than those in previous years. Both our 
students and their families are struggling under the weight of poverty. This greatly impacts the behaviors of students 
in school, their parents’ behavior and participation in their child’s education, and student daily attendance. 
Historically, 50%-55% of our incoming 9th graders come to CSSJ with attendance challenges, specifically, we have 36 
upcoming students with 20 or more absences from 8th grade. To support this attendance challenge, we have two full-
time social workers, one guidance counselor, a parent coordinator, and a school-based health center to assist our 
students and their families.. In addition, we have one Single Shepherd social worker and two guidance counselors to 
further support our students and their families.  

Our number of students with disabilities is large with an average of 25.46% of our population having IEPs. The 
majority of our IEP students are students who receive ICT services. We currently have 59 students who receive ICT 
services, 12 students who receive SETS, and 12 who receive self contain services for a total of 83 special education 
students.  

Our growing ENL population is currently at 19% of our overall student population. The breakdown for each level is 
listed below:

We have an ENL teacher and Chemistry teacher, who is dual certified, in providing support for our ENL population. In 
September, we distribute welcome letters to all parents in English and Spanish. The Parent Coordinator translates the 
document into Spanish and uses the NYC Translation Services for all other languages to be translated (Albanian, 
Fulani, Hausa, Mandingo, English, Spanish, Soninke, Yoruba) . Our handbooks, calendars and welcome packets are 
translated over each summer and sent home with students through our family group advisory system. In addition, this 
translation unit offers parents free translation services and connects schools with over the phone interpretation 
services for parents when needed.

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.

The Framework for Great Schools 

The element of the Framework for Great Schools in which we have made the most progress this year has been on 
rigorous instruction. Our professional development all year has been focused on rigorous instruction, specifically on 
teachers participating in curriculum development, review, and revision cycles in order to receive revision feedback on 
their curriculum and assessments that will better align their assessments to the over arching guiding questions and 
case studies for their courses, which reflect the PBAT standards, to ensure all students engage with complex materials 
and concepts that promote higher order thinking and build the conceptual understanding and knowledge, which is 
necessary to complete the graduation level PBATs. Peer observations and supervisor observations provide strong 
anecdotal evidence for successful implementation of these in classrooms on a regular basis.  

We continue to have a strong supportive environment for students, staff and families. We high levels of trust among 
all members of our school community and we have a highly collaborative school culture.  

For next year we will continue our focus on rigorous instruction. We have made big strides and will continue our work 
on this through use of our professional development time to teach, learn and share instructional strategies, to co-
develop unit and lesson plans, to design and implement assessments fully aligned to guiding questions, and to look at 
both student and teacher work. Our partnerships with the Consortium and Expeditionary Learning will support this 
work. 

Strengths 

Collaboration and self-reflection are highly valued in our school community and are embedded in our guiding 
principles, practices and policies.  

As a school community, we have a long-standing practice of using a goal setting and monitoring process to establish 
individual, department, grade-level and school-wide goals. 

Our school has created numerous teacher teams and committees to ensure that teacher voice is fully present in all 
aspect of the school. These include: planning committee, department teams, grade level teams, family group grade 
level teams, and hiring committee.  

Student voice is valued and present at our school through participation in multiple groups including hiring committee, 
recruitment team, sustainability team, student council, peer mediation team, 100% Respect campaign respect reps, 
and school leadership team, and by acting as attendance success peer mentors and restorative justice peer mediators. 

Fostering our students’ social and emotional development is a priority at our school and we have developed and 
implemented structures, such as family group (advisory group) in which every student entering the school becomes a 
member of a family group of approximately 15 other students and led by a teacher. This group meets four times a 
week to provide social and emotional support and to help students develop the necessary social-emotional skills and 
habits necessary for success. Family group also focuses on college and career readiness, using a school-developed 
curriculum, and provides weekly tutoring for students. This year we will use our advisory group time to focus on 
helping peers improve attendance in order to be more successful academically.  

Our Performance Based Assessment Task (PBAT) system guides our assessments, instruction and curriculum 
development. The process of producing and presenting PBATs prepares students for the reading, writing, oral 
presentation, problem-solving and analytic-thinking demands of college and helps students learn how to better 
manage time and organize their tasks. Our educational program is centered around our PBAT system.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Rigorous Instruction Strengths: 

According to our last Quality Review from the 2014-2015 school year, we received Well Developed scores in the 
Instructional Core areas of:  

 
 

Section 1.1 "Ensure engaging rigorous and coherent curricula in all subjects." 
Section 2.2: "Align assessment to curricula, use ongoing assessments and grading practices, and analyze 
information on student learning outcomes to adjust instructional decisions as the team and classroom levels. 

Our partnership with Expeditionary learning has enabled the instructional staff to revise and improve their curriculum 
with a focus on guiding questions that offer students thought provoking, engaging and rigorous questions that 
increases their connection to the course. Our staff has also worked on creating case studies that are connected and 
focused on answering the course guiding questions.  

In our most recent Principal Performance Observation feedback from November 2017 states the following strengths:  

  The Principal can point to a clear relationship between core instructional beliefs and practices across 

classrooms. Classes observed had learning targets, essential questions, alignment to the literacy standards, 
and students seated in groups. We saw students engaged in a blood splatter science lab, a math class 
decoding and translating secret messages, an Algebra class presenting solutions to word problems with an 
emphasis on the method they chose to solve the problem and why they chose that method. We also visited a 
Chemistry class learning about the Periodic Table, another science class taking assigned roles in the debate 
over sustainable energy debate and another science class utilizing the Carousel protocol to have a structured 
“conversation”.  

  Review of teacher curricula, assessments and passing rates demonstrate that teachers are creating rigorous 

curriculum, aligned to the Common Core Standards, and are creating assessments that are aligned to the 
curricula. Curriculum review and observations of teachers, using the Danielson Framework, show that 
teachers are implementing diagnostic, formative and summative assessments, aligned to the curricula, to 
meet the needs of all students.  

These strengths can be attributed to the planning sessions the principal, AP, and Expeditionary Learning coach have 
had in the summer of 2017 and 2018 in creating and revising the three year school plan. We have also created the 
"cabinet team" comprised of the leaders of each department that meet bi-weekly to discuss the actions and support 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15 

 

each department needs to achieve our CEP goals. The cabinet team also helps outline PD for the month and find 
topics that staff need further support.  

Other areas of celebration regarding the Spring 2017 PPO around curriculum, instruction and assessment educational 
shifts are:  

  The Principal engages teachers in a process of adapting or adopting to ensure that curricula are PBAT-aligned 

and meet all student needs. Principal has invested in sending the math department to the Bronx-run 
mathematics professional development group that has yielded positive changes in observed math curriculum. 
Continue to support teachers in finding engaging and rigorous resources for their courses and make sure that 
teachers are aligning their units and lessons to content area standards.(1.1) 

Our 2017-2018 high school graduation rate is 65.7% an increase of 11.5% from the 2016-2017 school year. This 
indicates that students are better prepared to successfully pass their graduation level assessments, i.e., the ELA 
Regents exam and the History, Science and Math Performance Based Assessment Tasks. Our college and career 
readiness index is 48% for students who graduated from high school and enrolled in college or other post secondary 
program within 6 months, and 58% for students enrolled in college 18 months. 

Needs of the School:  

Although we have made significant strides in strengthening course curriculum, there are areas that we still need to 
improve. Below are the instructional needs we still need to focus on according to our latest PPO:  

  The Principal eestablishes and articulates clear rationales for the investment of resources in school goals, and 

directly connects those goals to student achievement. Continue to explore ways to expand your course 
offerings to allow students to take more higher-level college-ready courses such as physics, pre-calculus, and 
calculus. (1.3) 

  The Principal supports and evaluates best practices for frequent assessment strategies across classrooms 

including checks for understanding and student self-assessment. Continue to work with teachers to 
systematize the ways in which they effectively formatively assess student learning during the lesson across 
classrooms. Teachers were observed doing thumbs up/thumbs down to indicate readiness to switch activities 
in chemistry and peer assessment of student group presentations in math. (2.2) 

  The PPO in November 2017 also recommends that we should, "Continue to explore ways to expand your 

course offerings to allow students to take more higher-level college-ready courses such as physics, pre-
calculus, and calculus. (1.3) As a result, we have implemented a computer programming and robotics course 
for our 11th & 12th grade students. In addition, we have created a Teens and the Law class to further educate 
our students rights and ability to make change within their community.  

Observations of teachers show that they are implementing rigorous, Common Core aligned curricula, but that we 
need to continue training and supporting teachers to consistently design and implement lessons that challenge all 
learners to think analytically and be engaged in intellectual inquiry. This year we will continue our work on 
strengthening the rigor of the curriculum and improving both engagement and critical thinking. The priority area of 
our educational shifts that will be targeted this year is continue aligning course assessments to the guiding questions 
and case studies. This will increase the college readiness skills and habits of our students and will result in higher 
graduation rates. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.

By June 2019, 100% of teachers will participate in curriculum development, undergo three curriculum revision cycles 
and review two major assessments through the National School Reform Faculty tuning protocol in order to receive 
revision feedback on their curriculum and assessments that will better align their assessments to the over-arching 
guiding questions and case studies for their courses, which reflect the PBAT standards, to ensure all students engage 
with complex materials and concepts that promote higher order thinking and build the conceptual understanding and 
knowledge, which is necessary to complete the graduation level PBATs.

State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
To help familiarize parents/guardians with our curriculum, instructional approach and assessments, and to help them 
better understand how they can support their child's educational studies, we will:  

1. Conduct an annual parent meeting for each grade level in which we review course curriculum and during which 
time we will provide all parents/guardians with copies of the grade level assessments and the syllabus for each 
course. This will occur at a parent meeting in September 2018. Grade level leaders will be responsible for organizing 
the curriculum information meeting or their grade level as well as providing all related curriculum materials such as 
course syllabi, assessments and grade level summative PBAT descriptions. The parent coordinator and family group 
advisors will be responsible for outreach to parents by mail, phone messenger, phone and email to encourage parent 
attendance. The APs and Principal will be responsible for overseeing this. 

2. Invite parents to participate in grade level PBAT presentations to better understand the PBAT standards, and the 
rigorous teaching and learning occurring in their child's courses. This will occur in January 2019 and May/June 2019. 
Grade level leaders and teams are responsible for organizing this and for creating an invitation letter for 
parents/guardians. Family group advisors and the parent coordinator are responsible for outreach to 
parents/guardians. APs and Principal are responsible for oversight.

As a result of teachers undergoing three curriculum revision cycles and a review of two major assessments in order to 
better align their assessments to the over-arching guiding questions and case studies for their courses will result in a 
5% increase in grade level and graduation level PBATs by Mid-February 2019. In addition, we will also monitor the 
following:  

  All staff will have participated in their department cycles of sharing and receiving feedback on course plans 
that focus on aligning assessments, guiding questions, and case studies for each unit that result in students 
producing higher quality written work that demonstrates deeper, critical thinking.  

  The EL coach will have conducted six week coaching cycles with targeted departments.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Our supportive and positive school culture is a strength and the backbone of our community. As a result, we have 
seen a significant decrease in our SVTI score that measures level 5 incidents in public schools. Our 2017-18 SVTI score 
dropped to .075 down from 1.15 in 2016-17. We firmly believe that this decrease is due to the expansion of the 
restorative justice program. Through our partnership with Ramapo for Children who have provided coaches, assisted 
in creating the 100% Respect Campaign, re-establish community core values and establish a peer mediation program 
and reintegration circles for our community. We have also built a three tier restorative justice program to build school 
community culture and respond restoratively to incidences when the school values are broken. 

Another reason for the decrease of our SVTI scores is family group. Family Group (Advisory) has been embedded into 
the school culture since the beginning of CSSJ. We have used it effectively to develop the bonds between student and 
advisor, between parent and advisor and among students in the group. As well, we have used it effectively to support 
the social and emotional development of our students and the college and career readiness capacity of our students. 
Family Group also supports the implementation of our restorative justice processes and structures.  

The following data trends from the 2017-18 Learning Environment Survey affirms this in student responses in the 
"Supportive Environment" and "Trust" sections, including: 

  98% of students report that teachers treat them with respect (Q4e) 
  96%of students say that there is at least one adult in the school that they can confide in. (Q4b) 
  96% of high school students say that adults at their school help them plan for how to meet their future career 

goals. (Q10d) 

This year we will focus on continuing to build and solidify our restorative justice program, focusing primarily on:  

1. consistent use of circles, at least two times a week, in Family Group in order to build and maintain trust, student 
voice, participation and accountability, and peer support of one another and of the school community culture 

2. All school members will implement with fidelity the behaviors defined in each of the three areas of the 100% 
Respect Campaign this year. the areas are: Student to Student; Student to Staff; Staff to Student. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          21 

 

By June 2019, our restorative justice program will further develop so that: 

1. Our community will reduce incidents on high and low level infractions that will result in a 5% decrease in referrals 
on OORS.  

2. 100% of family group advisors will consistently use circles in their family groups a minimum of twice a week and 
students in 100% of family groups will participate in circles 

3. 100% of staff members will participate in professional development training to increase capacity to consistently 
implement the 100% Respect actions in each area and help students in their family groups develop their capacity to 
do the same. 

4. 100 % of teachers will consistently define clear expectations and restorative responses for the community with a 
focus on cutting class, lateness, cell phone use and language.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

School Strengths: 

We have a strong habit and consistent practice of teacher/staff collaboration in order to improve curriculum, 
instruction and assessment, as well as a strong history of creating structures and routines to promote a culture of 
continuous collaboration and improvement. Evidence to support this includes our last Quality Review in 2014-15:  

  We received a score of Well Developed in the "Systems for Improvement" (4.2) section which rates the school 

on how well they engage in structured professional collaborations on teams using an inquiry approach that 
promotes shared leadership and focuses on improved student learning  

Furthermore, according to our 2017-18 Learning Environment Survey that further illustrates the strength of 
teacher/staff collaboration is as follows : 

  100% of teachers report that the principal and the teachers collaborative to make the school run effectively 

(Q5b) 

  100% of teachers say that they design instructional programs (for example, lessons and units) together. (Q8a) 
  100% of teachers say that they talk with one another about instruction. (Q8d) 

As a result of our teacher/staff collaboration we have a low teacher turnover rate every year, which shows the 
strength and unity of our community.  

According to our Principal Performance Observation (PPO) in November 2017 the Superintendent cites evidence of 
teacher collaboration (QR indicator 4.2) as an area of celebration, stating, "The Principal builds structures for teachers 
to meet regularly within teacher teams. Science department meets regularly, has a shared document on Google Docs 
for recording keeping and the teachers use school created PBAT progressions documents to support their practice in 
preparing students for the science PBAT. Teacher leaders are chosen and run the meetings independent of 
administration". (4.2) 

Next Steps: 

Both our department and our grade level teams meet weekly or bi-weekly, are teacher-led, and are experienced in 
creating, critiquing and refining curriculum and PBAT assessments collaboratively. Our next step is to have teachers 
work collaboratively in departments to align courses vertically and in grade levels to align courses horizontally, all 
working backwards from the identified exit CCSS skills and standards and from the PBAT graduation level rubric.

  Department teams will have created a comprehensive curriculum plan that vertically aligns the skills, content, 

concepts and standards, which all graduating seniors are expected to demonstrate, across all courses in that 
subject area, grades 9-12, and which clearly defines how the identified skills, content, concepts and standards 
are built upon from one grade level to the next; 

  Grade Level teams will have created a comprehensive plan that horizontally aligns the skills, habits, concepts 

and standards which all students in their grade level are expected to demonstrate through the grade level 
PBATs, across all courses in the grade level and which clearly defines how the identified skills, habits, concepts 
and standards are embedded in each course in that grade level.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths: 

The school leadership works collaboratively with the attendance team, grade level teams and FG advisors to establish 
and implement an attendance monitoring system that supports our students who fall between 69%-89% attendance, 
as well as chronically absent students. ATS attendance data shows that for the 2016-2017 school year we had a 78.6% 
attendance rate and 60.1% of our students were chronic absentees. After an analysis of student attendance and 
identifying a targeted group to work with for improvement, our school began a pilot attendance success mentoring 
program last spring with a targeted number of students and mentors.  

Needs: 

Our student attendance declined to 78.6% this past school year from 80.1%. Consequently, this coming school year 
our school leadership will re-introduce and expand our attendance initiative across all grade levels. School leaders will 
train family group advisors and guidance and social work support staff to play a more active and direct role in working 
with targeted students and their families to increase attendance. Additionally, school leaders will re-activate and 
monitor our success mentoring program, using both peer and staff mentors and will introduce activities to bring our 
parents into this program to support the success of their child.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
School leaders will implement and redesign attendance program, in September 2018 and followed throughout the year, 
involving active participation in all FG advisors and peer mentors in order to increase the school attendance rate to 80% 
by June 2019.

Each FG grade level team will select student mentors by using 
the following criteria (on track for PBATS, graduation, and a 
certain attendance rate). 

  Peer mentors would be selected by mid September  

Students in each FG, who can be targeted will be identified using 
the RAMO report in ATS, and this information will be shared with 
advisors as they select 3-5 students to mentor within their FG. 
Every marking period FG advisors will review the list of students 
targeted for attendance improvement, as well as student 
mentors to see if list should be altered.  

 

Recognize and celebrate the attendance gains made by the 
mentees. The peer mentors and mentees will receive recognition 
at the end of classes in Jan/June, and be honored with a 
ceremony and award certificates, pizza, pictures, and a bulletin 
board display of the awards and pictures of the students. Smaller 
recognition actions will include: having the family group advisors 
email the teachers of the students about their progress and 
asking them to congratulate them when they see them in class; 
giving our recognition slips to the mentees when they make 
progress and to the peer mentors, having FG advisors call home 
when see attendance improvement.

Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths: 

The PPO from November 2017 cites the school's strong, positive learning environment (QR indicator 1.4) as an area of 
celebration. It states that, "The Principal models and guides the school community towards a culture of respect and 
trust. The latest School Quality Survey results indicate growth in scores concerning effective leadership, trust, and 
community in all constituent groups. The Principal and the Assistant Principal form a dynamic team, with great 
knowledge and dedication to the school and the students, families and staff. They are effective at addressing and 
solving all manner of student conflict and parent complaints. All members of the school community report that CSSJ is 
more like a family than just a school". 

Our school has steadily expanded our community ties and resources to support both students and their families. For 
instance, we have increased the use of our guidance and social work team, along with coaches from Ramapo for 
Children, to provide parent workshops on salient topics; we have increased collaborations with community 
educational institutions, such as our upcoming partnership with Lehman College, to provide a stronger high school 
and college academic and social emotional link; and we have increased our community service program to provide 
increased opportunities for students, three times a year (September, December, & March) to provide a day of service, 
during the school day and on weekends, and in more community settings, such as soup kitchens, parks, gardens, and 
elementary schools.  

Needs:  

Our community will work on improving the overall attendance rate for the year. Through our initiatives of improving 
school culture (Camp CSSJ, Team building Wednesdays and Community Service Wednesdays) and implementing the 
attendance mentoring program in the fall 2018 semester we feel very strongly that attendance will increase. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

Time-bound.  
By June 2019, 100% of our parents of students designated as chronically absent, including those whose children are in 
our attendance success mentoring program, will be contacted by their child's family group advisor and the guidance 
counselor or social worker assigned to the grade level to discuss their child’s attendance, identify the steps the school is 
taking to address this, to provide information/assistance on how the parents can become partners in improving their 
child's school attendance, and to create action plans for increasing student attendance.

Create opportunities to actively engage parents in supporting 
their child’s attendance and academic progress by conducting 
outreach to parents - in person, by telephone and in written 
form -- at the beginning of the school year to explain their child's 
participation in this attendance improvement program, to 
identify ways in which parents and school can work together to 
support their child's success and to create an action plan.  

Engage in follow-up meetings with parents at least one time a 
semester to assess, and hopefully, celebrate student attendance 
progress and review academic progress to evaluate the effect of 
improved attendance on academic progress.

Directions: 
-  All Title I schools must complete Part A of this section. 
-  All Non-Title I schools must complete Part B of this section. 
 
Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS

2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population. 

At the beginning of the school year, our designated social worker meets with our students in temporary housing 
individually to conduct a needs assessment for each child and offer them services to meet these needs. In addition, a 
supply kit of both school supplies and toiletries is given to each of these students and is replenished over the course 
of the school year. Before the winter vacation, our STH population is given a $25 gift certificate to Target to assist 
them with the holiday season. Graduation seniors are given a college supplies package. The social worker also meets 
with the parents/guardians of our students in temporary housing to offer emotional support and to assist them with 
acquiring other services and supports. Finally, the school-based health center also supports our STH population with 
supplies and medical and mental health support as needed.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Recruitment:  

We recruit teachers by: 

● Contacting teaching universities with which we have an on-going relationship, such as Teachers College, Barnard, 
New York University and Lehman 

● Attending DOE sponsored hiring fairs 

● Posting on-line teaching position vacancy notices with our member organization, The NY Performance Standards 
Consortium 

● Participating in the the Select Fellows Recruitment Program and reaching out to the Peace Corps Fellows program 

● Viewing applications on the Open Market system 

All teachers must first submit a resume and copy of a valid teaching license, or demonstrate that they will be ready for 
hire by the start of the school year. This is reviewed by our hiring committee comprised of teachers, students and 
administrators. Teachers who meet the criteria, collaboratively established by our staff, are then invited to visit the 
school to conduct a demonstration lesson in a subject and grade level appropriate class of students and participate in 
an interview conducted by hiring committee and department members. If their lesson and interview meet the criteria, 
they are invited back for a second interview with the principal.  

Teacher references are checked by an administrator and/or hiring committee teacher. Licenses are reviewed by the 
school business manager to ensure that the teacher candidate is appropriately licensed and credentialed. 

Retention and Support  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

● In addition to the DOE mandated mentor support provided to all first year teachers, we also link our first year 
general education teachers with a special education teacher to help them better learn to differentiate and scaffold 
skills and knowledge for all students. 

● We have a new/newer teacher support group, led by our master teacher, which meets twice monthly after school 
to orient new teachers to the school, to address issues and concerns and to provide curricular and/or instructional 
support for new, newer or struggling teachers. 

● Our social workers and senior staff conduct professional development sessions for our new teachers prior to the 
beginning of the school year. 

● Our social workers, senior staff and restorative justice coaches provide professional development for new/newer 
teachers on leading an advisory group at the beginning of the school year and then provide additional support 
throughout the school year. 

● For all teachers, walk-throughs and observations target professional, pedagogical goals that the teacher has 
identified for him/herself for the school year. 

● A professional development plan is designed by the Planning committee and targets areas in which teachers have 
expressed a need and/or in which there has been an observed need. 

● Teachers work collaboratively in grade level, department and family group grade level groups to plan curriculum, 
design PBATs and share teacher and student work. These collaborations support our teachers, especially those who 
are new(er) or struggling. 

● All teachers are part of smaller professional learning groups and use these groups to conduct two rounds of inter-
visitations of classes during the year. This is supported by providing coverages so that teachers can visit colleagues. As 
well, teachers visit classes of colleagues in both network and Consortium schools. 

Assignments:  

Department heads and school leaders work collaboratively with new teachers to make decisions on teaching 
assignments that best suit the strengths of the new teachers. The number of preps is kept to a minimum for new 
teachers. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Ongoing professional development is provided to ensure that all staff members are equipped to help all students 
meet the CCSS. The school’s planning committee meets at the beginning of the school year to develop the school’s 
professional development plan, which includes a strong focus on development staff capacity to ensure that all 
students are better prepared to meet the CCSS. 

We are a PROSE school and we use expert teachers to support the development of our teachers. These teachers use 
their classrooms to model highly effective teaching practices, they work one-to-one with teachers to assist with 
aligning their curriculum and assessments to the CCSS, and they work with the administration to design the 
professional development plan and activities for the school year. 

We are a member school of the New York Performance Standards Consortium. On a regular basis, teachers attend 
professional development workshops during the school year on aligning curriculum with the CCSS with other member 
schools. They bring existing unit plans to examine and norm with teachers from other schools. They use this to then 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

revise their curriculum. In addition, teachers and members all participate in a twice yearly school inter-visitations and 
in an annual professional day of workshops.  

In addition, we are an associate Expeditionary Learning associate school and make use of an instructional coach from 
EL to assist us in the creation of our annual professional development plan, to facilitate PD workshops for the whole 
teaching staff, for departments and for new teachers, as well as tp conduct coaching cycles with individual, targeted 
teachers.  

We are in our 3rd full year of a restorative justice grant and coaches from Ramapo for Children provide professional 
workshops and in-classroom coaching/modeling to all staff, as well as to new teachers and those targeted for 
additional assistance.  

Another vehicle for professional development activities is through department professional development meeting 
time. Department members co-create and examine curriculum together including course overviews, unit maps and 
lesson plans against the CCSS to ensure alignments. The department members collaboratively develop and revise 
curriculum during the school year to maximize alignment to the CCSS. 

All unit maps and lesson plans developed by teachers at CSSJ follow a jointly developed template that requires 
teachers to explicitly identify how the unit/lesson aligns with the CCSS. 

School administrators receive professional development about the CCSS through both their Superintendent's office 
staff and through the NY Performance Standards Consortium

4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
We are a member school of the NY Performance Standards Consortium. As such, we use performance based 
assessment tasks (PBATs) in lieu of the Math, Science and Social Studies NYS Regents exams to graduate students. All 
teachers use the Consortium-developed graduation level rubrics in those areas to assess students. Teachers make 
decisions about formative assessments, in the form of smaller grade level and class level PBATs, as well as about 
culminating, graduation assessments. They work collaboratively in departments and in grade level teams to make 
curricular and instructional decisions and to co-create curriculum and assessments. Each smaller PBAT is assessed 
using a rubric based on the graduation level rubric in the appropriate area, or using the actual graduation level rubric. 
These PBATs and rubrics are collaboratively developed by teachers in their department and grade level groups. 

Teachers receive professional development in activities led by staff members and school leaders, as well as by staff 
from our partner organizations: NY Performance Standards Consortium, Expeditionary Learning and Ramapo for 
Children. In addition, they engage in instructional and curriculum development coaching cycles facilitated by coaches 
from the Consortium, Expeditionary Learning and Ramapo for Children; they attend Consortium designed professional 
development workshops; and engage in inter-visitations with member Consortium schools. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities

student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Community School for Social Justice , in compliance ESSA, is responsible for 
creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student 
achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by 
actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are 
encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee 
as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

[Community School for Social Justice] will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

●providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

●providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; providing parents with access to an interactive grading system, 
and training on how to use it, so that they can monitor their child's progress in each class on a weekly basis;

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;

parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.

A.   Saturday School Academy: 
During the school year, CSSJ will provide students with high quality instruction during a 
Saturday Academy program to increase achievement in core content areas.  Staff at this program 
will include 1 licensed ENL teacher, and at least 1 licensed content area teacher from Math, 
Science, Social Studies or English for a total of 2-5 staff members to provide support for ENL 
students. The program will be conducted in English. In addition,  a supervisor will also be on site 
but not paid through Title III.   
A total of 6 sessions will be held between January 2019-June 2019.  Students will work for 3 hrs, 
from 9:30am-12:30pm in two sessions, with the ENL teacher.  At Saturday Academy sessions, 
the ENL teacher will work with the English content teacher, if present, on preparing students for 
the English PBAT, the Humanities PBAT, the English Regents and/or the NYSESLAT.  If the 
English teacher is not present, the ENL teacher will work with ENL students in the content area 
they are working in (Science, SS, or Math) to provide additional support.  
During the first session, the ENL instructor will co-teach with the Math teacher from 9:00-
10:30.  During the second session, the ENL teacher will co-teach with the Science teacher from 
10:30am-12:00pm. The following week, the ENL teacher will co-teach the first session (9:00am-
10:30am) with the English teacher and the second session (10:30am-12:00pm) with the Social 
Studies teacher.  The ENL teacher will rotate with the Math/Science teachers and English/Social 
Studies teachers on a bi-weekly basis. The Saturday School dates are as follows:  
January: 5, 12 
April: 13 
May: 11 
June: 1, 8 
The ENL teacher will assist to deconstruct the concepts for ELLs while targeting skills needed to 
succeed in the content areas.   The Saturday School program will service 30 students from grades 
9-12. The teachers, consisting of a Math, Social Studies, Science and English teacher will co-
plan with the ENL teacher.  Teachers will be paid through Title III during the time they are 
teaching ELLs with the ENL teacher.  
Rationale: 
To offer enrichment in language development and increase achievement in core content 
areas.  We will focus on 20 Intermediate and Beginner students in 9th and 10th 
grades.  Additionally, Special focus will be paid to improving reading and writing skills to 
transition into college writing for  17 students in the 11th and 12th grades. Upper grade focus 
will be on Advanced students and our one intermediate students for a total of 12 eleventh and 
twelfth graders. 
  
Materials for Saturday Academy: 
-30 copies of Merriam Webster Spanish/English dictionaries and French/English dictionaries 
- Laptops so students can access class materials on Google chrome and Rosetta Stone

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
 
After School-Small Group Instruction: 
We offer small group instruction for approximately 20 students in grades 9-12. This small group 
instruction will help those students improve their reading and writing skills. Students are targeted 
based on their classroom grades, practice English Regents writing samples,  as will as their 
NYSESLAT reading and writing scores.  Skills will focus on acquisition of academic lexicon, 
essay writing and reading comprehension.  The small group instruction will begin in October 
2018 and continue through June 2019. Below are the days, times, and staff members providing 
support: 
-Every Tuesday and Thursday from 2:45-3:45  (about 4 times a month for a total of between 10-
14 meetings a year ) 1 ENL teacher will work with targeted students in collaboration with co-
teachers in providing academic support 
Rationale: 
To offer enrichment in essay writing and language acquisition to high need ELLs. In addition, 
the small group instruction will significantly impact academic development in core content 
areas.  The program will utilize the following methodologies: 
-Scaffolding as an essential part of the instructional delivery of the program, such as:  modeling, 
bridging, schema building, contextualization, text representation and meta-cognition. 
-Conferencing with students and informal assessments. 
-Acquisition of lexicon for academic progress. 
Materials to be used for After School-Small Group Instruction Program: 
-Bilingual dictionaries and thesaurus 
-Paper, markers, pens, poster paper and chart paper. 
- Co-planning will occur during the school day during the ENL and co-teacher preps  
 
-Funding will include pay for ENL teacher and the co-teachers during the time the ENL teacher 
is working with them after school if necessary.

The ENL teacher, Lucia Pichardo, will be working with the English department as a push-in 
teacher for the 2018-2019 school year.  The teachers will work together to target skills ELLs 
need to succeed in English classes. The teachers will include the ninth, tenth and twelfth grade 
English teachers and one 9th grade Special Education teacher.   Special professional 
development focus will be paid to targeting our sped./ELL sub-group, as well as entering and 
emerging ELL students.   PD will focus on techniques for content area vocabulary acquisition 
and writing skills for ELLs in preparation for the eleventh/twelfth grade English PBAT and 
Regents as well as how to modify lessons to aid in language acquisition and content area success 
for ELLs.  The NYSESLAT shows that students' greatest need for improvement is in reading and 
writing. The professional development session will discuss ways to target those skills in a 
content area class.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Paste response to questions here:  We are a portfolio assessment school with a Regents waiver from the state except for the 
ELA exam.  Therefore, we do not give assessment exams except Scan-tron, which is administered to all ninth and tenth grade 
students and assesses their current reading levels.  Our ninth grade ELLs all scored between the 4th and 6th grade reading 
levels.  Our tenth graders scored between the fifth and eight grade reading levels.  The scores only test through the ninth 
grade.  We do targeted reading intervention through English classes, which is where the ESL teacher pushes in.  We use small 
group instruction including literature circles and Socratic seminars to address reading concerns.  The ENL teacher reinforces 
phonemic awareness to build fluency.  We also offer Saturday instruction several times a year to target remediation for 
students in need of additional support.  The emphasis is on building reading and writing skills.   
  
Students are also assessed on the results of their NYSESLAT scores.  The ENL teacher then meets individually with students and 
assesses their academic needs.  We use this information to adapt and revise class curriculum and focus on the skills each 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

 

student needs.  We currently have three new ENL admits this year and they are completing their first year of 
service.  According to their NYSITEL scores they were non-English speaking when they arrived.    
  
We emphasize building reading and writing skills in classroom instruction.  The majority of our students who have difficulty 
progressing on the NYSESLAT are our long term ENL students (over six years).  Looking at our trends over time, we see that 
many of our newer students pass.  Therefore, we focus on our own assessments and instruction on pinpointing areas where 
students are struggling and focusing instruction specifically to these needs.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

ENL students are scheduled for after school tutoring 1-2 times a week. In addition, Saturday school support will also be 
provided during the December, January and May months.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Paste response to question here:   77.4% of our ENLs made AMAO so we found the push-in section of our program 
successful.  The ENL teacher will continue to push-in to our English classes across grade levels.  As 11 students are scoring at 
the entering and emerging levels in the ninth and tenth grade, we have added a separate section/course of ENL for those 
students.  Our ENLs have been successful in earning 10 credits or more and as a result have moved onto the next grade 
level.  For example,  87% of our ENLs were promoted during the 2016-17 school year, which was the highest achieving sub-
group in our population.  Furthermore, we will have the 2016-2017 NYSESLAT results in August 2017 for further 
summative assessments 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Meet with students to work on specific skills. 
After school tutoring 
Saturday school 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Paste response to question here:  N/A   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Paste response to question here:  Three new students entered the school in the second semester of ninth grade and were non-
English speaking based on the HLIS and NYSITEL  score.   Most students are either achieving a higher sore or passing the 
listening/speaking sections while scoring in the intermediate/advanced range in the reading and writing sections.  Newly 
admitted students (1-6 year range) are progressing more quickly than the long term ENLs.  Special education ENLs who have 
been ENLs for their entire school careers are having difficulty passing the reading/writing section.  Most of our newly admitted 
ninth grade ENLS were long-term ENLs and ELLS with IEPs.  Most of our current 10-12th grade general education students 
progressed on the test, improving in one or more modalities.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The Enl teacher will work with the SPED department and general education teachers to further support long term ENL 
students. Weekly co-planning sessions will occur during or after school.   

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Paste response to questions here:   A stand-alone nine/ten  ENL class has been implemented to address the needs of 
the lower level grade students.  It consists of entering and emerging students.  It is given four periods a week for a 
total of 254 minutes.  The ENL teacher team teaches a heterogeneously grouped (integrated) English class in the ninth 
grade and tenth grade. OPur ENL teacher also pushes in the 12th grade Civics/Economics course to support our older 
ENL students.   We have a dual certified Science/ENL  teacher that will be providing ENL support in the 11th grade. 
The students in each grade level travel as a block.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Paste response to questions here: N/A    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Paste response to questions here: N/A    

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Paste response to questions here:   Mid to late August of every year, our ENL teacher and grade level advisors meet to 
cohort ENL students according to their NYSESLAT results. Co-horting the students ensures each student receives their 
mandated minutes and we only provide Stand Alone ENL for our entering and emerging students.  The ENL teacher team 
teaches in an English class for 9th & 10th grade and team teaches a 12th grade Civics/Economics class.  Our 11th graders are 
supported by our dual certified Science/ENL teacher. Our ENL teacher and programmer work together to ensure all students 
are programmed into an ELA class for support. Students are provided with one period of HLA support a day during their lunch 
period if needed.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Paste response here:    Content areas are taught in English. Using the push-in model, the ENL teacher co-plans with subject 
area teachers and also provides direct instruction on occasion.  She ensures that ENL students receive explicit instruction 
throughout the course.  As a projects based school, the ENL teacher works directly with the students in small groups providing 
instruction through the content areas and supplementing as needed to target each students' needs. This allows the  ENL 
teacher to work with the subject area teachers to better scaffold and differentiate  instruction for the ELLs.  The subject area 
teachers are also able to extend this training throughout other areas of their instruction.  The ENL Teacher is also able to learn 
the mainstream content and target entry points for their students.  Teachers have access to bilingual materials, such as 
Spanish dictionaries and a Dual Lingo program,  to supplement their assignments.  Students are paired with a non-ELL bilingual 
student who can provide translation when necessary.  Students are supplied with pictures to help them understand 
concepts.  Additionally, each class with beginners has a bilingual para-professional assigned to the class to help with those 
students' translation needs.   Additional time is provided after school.  Many assignments are adapted to students' 
levels.  Students receive bilingual dictionaries when needed as there are sets available in every classroom and one has been 
provided for the beginners to carry with them and bring home.   
 
Minutes are broken down as follows: 
 
ENTERING:  1 unit of stand-alone and 2 units of integrated 
EMERGING:  1 unit of stand-alone and 1 units of integrated 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70 

 

TRANSITIONING:  1 units of integrated 
EXPANDING:  1 unit of integrated 
COMMANDING:  1 unit of integrated  
 
Some of the methods teachers employ are the use graphic organizers in the subject area classes., including; T-Charts (list ideas 
and explain), Venn Diagram (categorize, compare and contrast) Tree Diagram (Organize pre-writing) to help with 
comprehension.   We also implementation cross-curricular word analysis and language dissection:  Word Walls, reinforcement 
of content area vocabulary in ENL, English, Science and Social Studies Classes focusing on cognates, definitions and usage of 
prefixes and suffixes Direct Vocabulary instruction including the use of student generated personal dictionaries to define new 
words using first formal definitions then re-phrasing, visuals and sentences.  Definitions include content area terminology as 
well as conversational language.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   Paste response to question here:  Materials are provided in their native language throughout the year.    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Paste response to questions here:   A.  SIFE students are identified at the beginning of the school year.  Parents of all SIFE 
students are called and the ENL teacher, Assistant Principal, Parent Coordinator and the students staff advisor attempt to meet 
with the student and their parent to identify the cause of the concern, discuss a plan to aid the student in improving their 
attendance and implementing a tutoring schedule with the ESL teacher and the subject area teachers to help bring the student 
up to grade level.  If the parent is unavailable, the meeting is held with the student and the parent is called to seek their 
assistance in implementing the program.  The student’s attendance is monitored by the Advisor, ENL and grade level team 
teacher and the parents are called if a pattern begins to develop.  Should attendance become an issue, the Parent Coordinator 
brings the concern to the attendance committee who use their resources to help the student.  During tutoring, subject are 
teachers focus on each students' deficiencies while reinforcing new material.  Each content area teacher works with a Special 
Education teacher in one of their cohorts.  They jointly modify their materials for the special education students.  These 
materials are often used to differentiate instruction for SIFE students in conjunction with grade level materials to help scaffold 
the students to be able to work at grade level.  When necessary, although we use a monolingual program, materials are given 
in the students' native language to aid in acquisition.  Students can also receive help during our daily advisory period called 
Family Group.  Their advisor, a licensed teacher, works with students to help them better understand and complete their 
assignments.  They have access to each students progress reports on SKEDULA, an online grade book system, to help monitor 
their progress in each content area, consulting with content teachers to provide supplementary materials to students as 
needed. 
  
B. Newcomers will receive ENL methodologies through a stand-alone and integrated programs by the ENL teacher.  New ENL 
students will pair up with another bilingual English proficient student who speaks their native language. They will also receive 
tutoring during the week and on Saturdays.  They will receive periodic assessments based on the information being taught in 
their classes, including ENL, to ensure that they are progressing, and intervention strategies will be provided if they are 
not.  Subject area teachers make use of bilingual materials available to them to help aid the student.  Bilingual 
paraprofessionals are assigned to each class with newcomers and they help translate for the students.  The paras have 
received extensive professional development from our ENL Teacher and work with her during class so they can observe her 
techniques.  During tutoring and Saturday School, the ENL teacher addresses the English Regents.  Students are given direct 
instruction on the test starting in the second semester of tenth grade, practicing their reading comprehension, listening and 
note taking and learning about the different forms of writing required.  Students are given materials, including extra 
vocabulary, to study at home. 
  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71 

 

C.   4th-6th year students are individually assessed by the ENL teacher at the start of school to determine their strengths and 
weaknesses.  Writing and reading diagnostics are administered and the results are discussed with the subject teachers and the 
student so target areas can be determined and addressed.  The ENL teacher then uses this information along with the 
NYSESLAT to design a program for use in ENL.  Instruction is normally focused on further acquisition of reading and writing 
skills as the majority of students are at or near proficiency in speaking and listening. The ENL teacher focuses their instruction 
on helping students acquire the targeted skills and extend its use to the subject areas.  Instruction is also more focused at this 
time on acquiring content area terminology and reading and writing across the subject areas.  The teacher works with the 
subject area teachers to help them differentiate instruction to focus on the students needs.  Teachers make use of group 
assignments, pairing the student with another student who has strong skills in those areas.  They also provide extra instruction 
on content area vocabulary acquisition and give students extra vocabulary sheets to aide in content knowledge acquisition. 
  
D. Long-term ENLs are fully serviced as per their NYSESLAT scores.  Assessments are made to determine which modalities need 
to be addressed.  The student’s attendance, admission and test history are researched to help determine possible causes for 
the student’s status and addressed as needed.  Students are encouraged to come to tutoring after school and on 
Saturdays.  Tutoring focuses on content area acquisition as well as intensive language acquisition instruction.  We piloted it in 
the ninth grade last year and are starting it in the tenth grade this year.  
 
E.  Former ENLs  are programmed into the English class being serviced by the ENL Teacher.  They receive a minimum of 90 
minutes per week in the twelfth grade and 243 per week in 9-11.   Service is given in a heterogeneously grouped integrated 
class. Students are programmed into the class with the ENL teacher twice a week  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Paste response to question here:  All our teachers co-plan and/or co-teach their lessons with a Special Education teacher who 
is an expert in the subject area.  In conjunction with the ENL Teacher, they work together to modify the curriculum to meet 
each individual students' needs.  The special education teacher will often  modify assignments and provide supplementary 
materials in addition to the ENL Teacher.  The two departments have worked closely to share techniques and determine what 
interventions are necessary to aid each child.  Vocabulary words are provided to supplement materials.  Lessons are scaffolded 
to ensure comprehension.  Materials are often modified and rubrics are modified as needed.  Students language needs are 
targeted with the following programs as necessary:  Wilson Reading, Read Naturally, Basic Writing Skills and Scan-tron.     
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Paste response to question here:  Special needs students are serviced as per their IEPs.  ICT status is determined by the IEP 
team with consultation with the ESL teacher.  At each annual meeting, continued ICT service is provided contingent upon 
parental agreement. ICT students are serviced in class by the ENL teacher and the Sp. Ed. teacher.  SETTS students are serviced 
both in and outside of class. The ENL teacher meets with the Special Education team to discuss the student’s needs and helps 
implement curriculum modification based on their needs.  Students whose needs cross-over into both areas are grouped and 
serviced together.  Regular meeting are held between the departments to continue to update and address those students 
needs.  Our ICT students are served in classes with general education students for all their subjects providing them with the 
least restrictive environment throughout the day.  Students are mixed with their non-disabled peers in all electives and gym 
class and family group.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Paste response to question here:   Content areas are taught in English. Using the push-in model, the ENL teacher co-plans with 
subject area teachers and also provides direct instruction on occasion.  She ensures that ENL students receive explicit 
instruction throughout the program.  Teachers have access to bilingual materials to supplement their assignments.  Students 
are paired with a non-ELL bilingual student who can provide translation when necessary.  Students are supplied with pictures 
to help them understand concepts.  In math, teachers provide targeted interventions to ELL students by color coding problems 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72 

 

on the Smart Board to assist students to learn the order of operations, use number sense, and review basic operations.   There 
is also a paraprofessional in the class to give additional support to students.  In Social Studies, teachers target vocabulary 
acquisition to increase content comprehension.  In science, teachers target comprehension through the use of manipulative 
and the use of science-based Duolingo .  
  
  8  th   grade ELA scores showed that approximately 60% scored at a level one and 35% scored at a level 2 and 5% scored at a 
level 3.   We had no level 4 students.  All ninth grade students are assessed through Scan-tron.  Scores show that 90% are 
scoring between the 3  rd   and 5  th   grade levels.  We use this to determine target areas in reading comprehension and 
create small groups to be taught by the ESL and Special Education English specialist.  "Native language texts are 
provided.  Additional time is provided after school.  Many assignments are adapted to student’s levels.  Special Education ELLs 
are also serviced through our certified Wilson Reading Specialist.  They are also given Read Naturally, Basic Writing Skills and 
Great Leaps as needed.  Our general education ELLs are given Read Naturally and Basic Writing Skills as needed.     
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Paste response to question here:  A stand-alone class was implemented for ninth and tenth grade entering and emerging 
students.  Consideration is being given to how service will continue as they progress through the grades.  We are considering 
making a separate stand-alone class for 11  th   and 12  th   grade entering and emerging students as needed.    
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Paste response to question here:   None 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Paste response to question here:   ELL students have the same access as any other student to all programs.  They are 
encouraged by the ENL teacher and their family group advisors to participate in extra-curricular activities such as: tutoring, 
Saturday academy, Deloitte Academy, clubs, and sports teams.  All advertising information are provided in English and their 
Native Language.  Ell students are offered additional support by participating in our tutoring program and  Saturday 
academy.  We ensure that all communication about school program offerings are sent home in the parent preferred language 
to encourage participation in our programs.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Paste response to question here:   Students have access to texts and worksheets in the Native Language.  They have  access to 
computers in every classroom and Smartboards in grades 9-12.  Students have access to bilingual books in the Library.  Each 
student is given access to a bilingual dictionary.  They can use language learning programs on the Internet.  Additionally, 
students are taught how to use the translation program in google.docs as they begin using our schools network in the ninth 
grade in order to prepare them to write their Performance Based Assessment Tasks  which are all complete on 
google.docs.  The following strategies are used across the curriculum; graphic organizers in the subject area classes.  T-Charts 
(list ideas and explain), Venn Diagram (categorize, compare and contrast) Tree Diagram (Organize pre-writing) Implementation 
of cross-curricular word analysis and language dissection:  Word Walls, reinforcement of content area vocabulary in ENL, 
English, Science and Social Studies Classes focusing on cognates, definitions and usage of prefixes and suffixes.  We also use 
manipulative where applicable, visuals are provided to help students grasp concepts, and teachers use role playing.  Students 
are given choices of how they want to complete written classroom assessments ranging from oral responses for beginners to 
letters, essays, pamphlets or posters for more advanced students. Mini-Lessons for direct instruction of identified grammatical 
errors.  Individual student conferencing to address specific student’s needs.  Reviewing student generated writing with the 
individual student to address their specific needs.  Direct Vocabulary instruction including the use of student generated 
personal dictionaries to define new words using first formal definitions then re-phrasing.  Definitions include content area 
terminology as well as conversational language.  Students also begin using google.docs to write their essays and Pbats in the 
ninth grade.  All their documents are shared with the ENL teacher who is able to give them feedback and direction on their 
work through the program.   As this feedback is also seen by the subject area teacher, they can better focus and adapt their 
materials for each child and further aid in their individual language acquisition.   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73 

 

ELLs use laptops in all their class.  Each student has a google account.  They use it to help write their papers and to translate 
documents.  Teachers are able to respond directly onto their papers and to translate any comments needed.    
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Paste response to question here: Materials are translated by teachers for students using google.docs.  Additionally, the Science 
and Social Studies classes have Spanish versions of textbooks that can help students better understand the material presented 
in class.  They are brought to the Library regularly to take out materials in their native language.   The students are also taught 
to use google.docs to help them with translations.  Part of the reason we chose WritetoLearn as a language using tool is 
because it will translate words for students into Spanish furthering comprehension.    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Paste response to question here:  When we have students who require bilingual speech, a  speech teacher is brought in to 
work with him. All SETTS and ICT services are given in English.  A bilingual paraprofessional is assigned to each ICT class to 
provide translation services as needed.  No students require counselling in a language other than English.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Paste response to question here:   Students have access to texts and worksheets in the Native Language.  They have  access to 
computers in every classroom and smartboards in grades 9-12.  Students have access to bilingual books in the Library.  Each 
student is given access to a bilingual dictionary.  They can use language learning programs on the internet.  Additionally, 
students are taught how to use the translation program in google.docs as they begin using our schools network in the ninth

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Paste response to question here: Every May, letters are sent home inviting students and parents to a 9th grade orientation. All 
letters are sent in both English and the native language.  The ENL teacher meets with incoming ELLs and their parents to 
discuss the schools various programs, the Pbat process and explains the options the parent is entitled to.  Letters are sent 
home to all the ninth grade students at the end of the June inviting them to a three day team building workshop stressing 
collaboration and community building to be held in July.  ELLs are called by the ENL teacher and asked to attend to help them 
become more comfortable and better acclimated.  When new students enroll, they are given an orientation with the ENL 
teacher and a student is assigned to assist them in class.  The ENL teacher introduces the student to their classroom teachers 
and Family Group teacher who assists in the transition.

2.  The ELL teacher goes to several workshops each year provided by BETAC and the Office of ELLs such as the LAP workshop to 
better implement instruction.  She also attends workshops with our Network, CFN 102, and works closely with our ELL 
instructional coach at the Network.  This work includes Inquiry groups and Professional Development.  In addition, the ENL 
teacher will often utilize workshops given by outside agencies like the New York Times.   All workshops are designed to align 
with the Common Core.  The ENL teacher provides professional development to the Guidance Counselor on working with ELLs 
and their needs.  They meet regularly to discuss the needs of the ENL population.   
The ENL teacher may bring English and subject area teachers.    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
.  Teachers are provided with background information on each new student such as:  NYSESLAT scores and years of 
service.  Also, the ENL teacher attends the three day ninth grade orientation over each summer to meet and evaluate all new 
ENL student. She then shares the data with teachers, guidance counselor and administration during the first week of school. 
During the year, the Guidance Counselor and Social Workers work with ELL students to address individual academic and 
emotional needs as they transition into high school.

Paste response to question here:  4.  The 7.5 hours includes workshops on discussing the individual needs of students during 
grade level meetings.  It also includes workshops in each subject area during department meetings to areas specific to each 
subject.  Teachers are taught to understand the particular needs of ELLs focusing on scaffolding language and targetting each 
modality in every lesson. Training for staff begins in the start of the school year with the ENL teacher reviewing NYSESLAT 
scores and testing levels.  She also explains the scores to the staff.  The ENL teacher attends weekly grade level meeting to 
review student progress and train teachers on meeting the needs of the ELLs in their cohort.  The ENL teacher gives training at 
staff meeting on improving instruction with topics including: vocabulary acquisition, writing across the curriculum, using visual 
aids to improve subject comprehension, modifying language on materials and exams, and testing compliance.  The ENL teacher 
also trains teachers on the techniques she acquires from the outside workshops she attends.  Our ENL teacher has received 
extensive training in it and meets bi-monthly with a cross-section of teachers who are then able to turn-key the training to 
their departments and staff. Training occurs during staff meetings, on professional development days and during department 
meetings.    Agendas are kept by the principal's secretrary and in the ENL Teacher's binder in her office.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Individual meetings with parents are organized by the ENL Teacher and the individual students' Family Group teacher who is 
the point person for individual student contact.  At the meeting, the ENL teacher attends and discusses their language 
development and what individual goals are put into place for each student.  Translation services are provided by the parent 
coordinator or a bilingual paraprofessional or the city translation service, should no one in the school speak the parent's 
language.  Records for meetings are kept by the Family Group teacher and the ENL teacher on a spreadsheet.  Parents who are 
unable to attend in person are scheduled for phone conferences.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jaime Guzman, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

We use ATS reports to identified the home language of our students. In addition, during the Parent/Student 
Orientation in June 2016 we also identified the students home language and the preferred language of contact. 
For new admits we use the Home Language Informational Survey (HLIS), which is administered by the ENL 
Coordinator on the first day entering school. We also use the RHLA and RCPL reports on ATS to further identify 
languages from our parent community. As well, at the beginning of the school year family group advisors contact 
the homes of new admits and verify the home language the parents/guardians speak and read in order to provide 
effective communication with our parent community. If any discrepancies are found, the parent coordinator calls 
to verify. Finally, the information is then given to the school community during the 2nd week of staff meeting.  

We then use this information to ensure that all written and verbal communication (such as the phone messenger 
system) goes home in English as well as in the parents’/guardians’ preferred choice of language.

when needed. 

 

We send bi-monthly parent letters in 
English and Spanish keeping parents 
involved in upcoming school events 
such as club activates, sport games and 
Saturday school and tutoring. The 
Parent Coordinator translates all 
documents into Spanish and uses the 
NYC Translation Services for other 
languages for translation (Albanian, 
Fulani, Hausa, Mandingo, English,

All parent-teacher conference 
announcements are mailed home in 
both English and Spanish and the

We will use our school messenger system to communicate with a majority of our English and Spanish speaking 
families. We will also use staff members that speak Albanian and Arabic to reach out to those familes during school 
emergencies. We will also work with the Translation and Interpretation Unit to assist us in reaching out to our handful 
of parents that we are unable to communicate directly.

All staff will receive the Chancellor's regulation A-663 during the first day of school on September 5th. They will sign 
that they have read and understood the regulations. Our parent coordinator will identify translation resources within 
the building and services that we they can use from the DOE.

information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents

We also provide notification to our parents through our website and social media such as Facebook and Instagram. In 
addition,my parent coordinator will consistently work with the translation and interpretation unit that offers parents 
free translation services for the following languages Albanian, Fulani, Hausa, Mandingo, English, Spanish, Soninke, 
Yoruba and connects schools with over the phone interpretation services for parents when needed.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Parents can contact and provide feedback to the school as they wish. We have and open door policy with our parental 
population and they are able stop and visit the school when they have questions or want to provide feedback. 
Through our family group system, advisors are in weekly contact with parents in updating student academic and 
behavior progress, upcoming school events, and to inform of our monthly SLT and PTA meetings. During these 
meetings, parents also have the opportunity to provide feedback regarding school services. In addition, once a year 
the Learning Environment Survey is conducted giving access to all families in providing feedback regarding our school 
community. My survey coordinator will work with the parent coordinator to assure that every parent receives a 
Learning Environment survey in their preferred language.
