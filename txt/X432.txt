Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets, the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement 
 
NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             8

School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 

Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you

monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title 

I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

It is our mission to build a small community where every student is known personally and supported in achieving their 
intellectual, linguistic, and social-emotional potential. Teachers and staff work closely with students to help them 
achieve their academic goals and explore their interests and passions. Our community is designed to meet the needs 
of English Language Learners while honoring the values and contributions of all members of our community – 
students, parents, school faculty and staff, educational partners, and the local community. Our students' cultural and 
linguistic backgrounds are an integral part of our academic work. We are committed to assisting students in 
maintaining the richness of their personal histories and providing them with a sense of their place in the greater 
community. We provide an academically rigorous and intellectually challenging experience to ensure all students are 
in a position to positively impact their community and access opportunities in the broader society. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Bronx Bridges High School is a Title-I school co-located with seven other academic programs on the Stevenson High 
School campus at 1980 Lafayette Avenue in the Bronx. Our school serves students in grades nine through twelve, and 
our current enrollment consists of 382 students. 

 

To ensure the success of our mission, we have fostered several partnerships. For example, we partnered with Good 
Shepherd Services to support the social and emotional development of our students. Additionally, we are working 
with Sadie Nash, which focuses on leadership development, medical and emotional wellness as well as college and 
career readiness. Finally, we are also working with Hostos Community College Liberty Partnership Program and 
Monroe College to assist students in sharpening their academic skills while also offering enrichment courses in the 
pursuit of careers in computers, health, math, science and overall career readiness. 

Bronx Bridges' population includes 26 students with special needs  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our school currently serves English Language Learners which includes students with students with Disabilities. We 
have around 65 Students with formal interrupted education; 25 students who recently arrived from war torn 
countries and 20 student with immigration trauma.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The strengths of our school consist of our diversity and our commitment to ensuring our students accumulate credit 
from year to year. First and third year students made 7.2% and 15.2% increase in credit accumulation respectively. 
Similarly, the lowest bottom third of students in their first year made 21.5% credit accumulation increase while 
students in their third year increase their credit accumulation by 0.9%. Additionally, we have made consistent 
increase in the average score for Regents exams across the board with the exception of living environment as well as 
completion rates for Regents exams. Finally, our four year graduation rate increase 6.9% from 2016 to 2017. 

 

We are in a well-developed school in structures regarding teacher teams to make adjustments to address all

One of three challenges we are currently addressing entails maintaining strong attendance. Another challenge 
encompasses ensuring our students are college and career ready by the end of their four year at Bronx Bridges, and a 
final challenge is ensuring that more than students graduate with a Regents diploma. 

 

For the 2018-2019 academic years, we have two instructional foci: using intentional grouping to support diverse 
learners and the development of interdisciplinary projects to ensure rigor is infused throughout each unit of study. 
The area in which we have made the most growth consist of developing teachers teams (i.e., professional learning 
communities) that are inquiry driven. Additionally, we have aligned our professional development plan (i.e., Sheltered 
Instructional Protocol and Quality Teaching for English Language Learners) to our instructional focus. To support this 
efforts, we are working intentionally and consistently on attendance tracking, monitoring and student support.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans  

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, 
and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious 
intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support) 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice 
Tenet 3 Statement of Practice 
Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan.

The school leader ensures and supports the quality implementation of a systematic plan of 
rigorous and coherent curricula appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning 
Standards (CCLS) that is monitored and adapted to meet the needs of students. 
Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction 
(DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and 
address student achievement needs. 
The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner 
within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the 
arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities. 
Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative 
assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student 
reflection, tracking of, and ownership of learning.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

According to the 2017-2018 School quality report the 4-year graduation rate increased from 57.5% in 2017 to 71.4% in 
2018 marking a 13.9% increase. Instruction during the 2017-2018 school year focused on modeling rather than telling, 
engaging students in productive struggle and a refined instructional focus that supported intentional grouping and 
language acquisition in all four modalities (reading, writing, speaking and listening). The amount of students gaining 10 
or more credits from among the school's lowest third increased by 6.7 % moving from 53.3 in 2017 to 60% in 2018.  

The content global history subgroup decreased 3 percentage points from 58.7 in 2017 to 55.7 in 2018. The percentage 
of students in the senior cohort who received 10 or more credits in the 3rd year decreased by 2.9 percentage points 
from 83.1 in 2017 to 80.2 in 2018. The social studies PLC will receive outside instructional support on making content 
accessible and engaging for ELLs in preparation for the state wide transitional exam in global history. Social studies 
teachers will attend AP for all instruction training and vertical alignment planning sessions. Through the AP for All 
initiative the social studies department will also receive on site consulting structured to support student content 
mastery and performance on state exams.  

Our instructional focus emphasizes modeling not telling, productive struggle, engaged students and language acquisition 
in the four modalities.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 

One strength of the school relates to parent and student satisfaction with the school environment and level of trust 
among parents. The 2015-2016 School Survey Report reveals that Bronx Bridges High School has successfully crafted an 
environment of which parents approve. Based on the 2016-17 NYC School Survey, 96% of parents were satisfied with 
teachers’ efforts to help students learn. In addition, over 97% of parents feel respected by their child’s teachers. 
Similarly, 94% of students agreed or strongly agreed that their teachers treat them with respect. Finally, 89% of teachers 
expressed their belief of mutual respect at Bronx Bridges High School. 

Another strength of the school pertains to a supportive environment. The 2016-17 NYC School Survey reveals 82% of 
positive responses towards the learning environment. 81% of students feel that it is important to come to school 
everyday. Parents expressed that 89% of their children feel that it is important to pay attention in class. In addition, 97% 
of teachers said that adults in this school inspire students to work towards a college degree. 

One area for improvement, as identified on the School’s most recent Quality Review for 2015-2016, concerns rigorous 
instruction. The Quality review reveals that a rigorous and coherent curricula in all subject areas is an area of focus. In 
addition, The Graduation Tracker reveals that 39% of second-year students are off track and 43% are almost off track. 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             23 

 

81% of third-year students are off track and 7% are almost off track. Finally, 75% of four-year students are off track 
and 17% are almost off track. 

The goal addresses the priority and the action plan aligns to the need in creating an environment that will nurture the 
social and academic development of all students in order to maintain at least 86% of students earning 10+ credits 
annually, within 4 years.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools –Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
 

As a result of focus on intervention and counseling, the number of 12th grade students on track for graduation will 
increase from 54 to 70 by the end of June 2019.

In an effort to increase parental involvementt, PTA meetings will be 
held monthly, in conjunction with celebrations of student 
achievement, to increase parent involvement. Increased 
communication via monthly letters, calendars, and phone calls to 
inform parents of the activities taking place at school. 

Teachers will develop promotion- in-doubt summative assessments 
(projects and multi-level tasks) for students who are at risk of failing 
their courses for the semester. Students will complete such projects 
with the goal of gaining content and language skills necessary to 
fulfill the course requirement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Each content area will develop content specific assessments 
(Baseline, Midline, and Endline) to ensure students are provided

Guidance and counselors will host structured conversations (at least 
one each term) with students to ensure that students are on track 
(e.g., scholar reports and teacher feedback) with credit 
accumulation as well as preparing for identified regent exams. 

 

 

Adults will use prompts to engage students in a self-advocacy 
thought process. For example, counselors and grade advisers will 
present students with a scenario, and the student will explore how 
he/she can arrive at best option.

The 2016-2017 Snapshot highlights that 83% of teachers indicate they work together to design instructional programs. 
We seek to improve this to 86% matching the citywide average.  

 

As per the 2016-2017 Snapshot 90% of teachers said they have opportunities to work productively with colleagues in 
their school. This is 4% of above the citywide average of 86%. By the end of June 2018 we hope to increase this number 
to 94%.  

As noted in the 2016-17 NYC Quality Review, the school is proficient in establishing structured professional 
collaborations within teams in which every staff member is a member in at least one Professional Learning Community 
(PLC), which promotes shared leadership and focuses on improved student learning. Within the content PLCs, teachers 
meet weekly, following a 6-week cycle to mirror the 6-week assessment cycle, to plan and strengthen the vertical 
alignment of curricula. From the 2015-16 NYC School Survey, 91% of teachers feel they have time to collaborate with 
other teachers and have time to work together on teams to improve their instructional practice.

However, also noted in the 2014-2015 School Survey, 63% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that overall, their 
professional development experiences this year have been sustained and coherently focused, rather than short-term 
and unrelated.. Additionally, based on the Quality Review, the school needs to refine the process of how teacher teams 
evaluate student work and adjust their practices to implement instruction that accelerates learning for specific 
subgroups that are within the English language learner population.

Bronx Bridges High School underwent a NYC Quality Review in 2014. Findings from this review identified that the school 
was developing in its capacity to cultivate a coherent set of beliefs about how students learn best. Findings indicate the 
need to enhance instructional practices to consistently reflect purposeful grouping that maximized student learning and 
pacing that allows time for teachers to measure students’ mastery of each learning objective. The school is presently 
“meeting targets” for student achievement as indicated in the 2014-15 NYC School Quality Guide. 

Based on the 2016-2017 New York School Survey, students believe that the school offers a wide enough variety of 
programs, classes, and activities to keep students interested in school. 84% of students responded that, in most or all of 
their classes, they know what their teacher wants them to learn in class. The focus area for this Capacity Framework 
Element is to support teachers in developing a coherent set of beliefs about how students learn best while also offer 
more targeted opportunities for students to further engage in more diverse curriculum.

During 2017-18 the school was identified as Priority Focus but with the recent gains such as an increased graduation 
rate, it is expected that our standing will improve. Also, as per the Quality Snapshot, 97% of parents feel that the 
principal works to create a sense of community in the school. Further 78% responded positively to questions about 
effective school leadership.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.  
As a result of increased opportunities for teaching and support, by June 2019, the overall percentage of teachers rated 
effective in Domain 3 on Advance will increase from 43% to 55% as measured in the MOTP summary.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

Target Group(s) 
Who will be 
targeted? 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

To develop a coherent set of beliefs about how students learn 
best we will sequence department PLC cycle around the Tuning 
Protocol, with a strong focus on data analysis and looking at 
student work. 

To support credit accumulation and a more diverse and engaging 
curriculum, Common Core aligned modules will be redesigned to 
address academic gaps and credit bearing as well as more 
engaging; PLC leaders will collaborate with the Principal before 
the beginning of the second semester in order to craft high-
interest modules that are aligned them to Common Core 
Standards 

To support teacher support in shifting from ineffective and 
developing to effective while also fostering a coherent set of 
beliefs about how students learn best. Professional development 
will be provided collaboratively, flexibly and individually 
throughout the academic calendar 

Administrators and Instructional Coach will conduct a series of 
non-evaluative observations, prioritizing teachers who are 
developing or ineffective in Domain 3. These will also serve as 
coaching clinics, where on the spot intervention will be done, 
demonstrating the effective practices. Administrators will also 
model pedagogical practices specific to elements of Domain 3, 
and hold conferences to discuss specific strategies learned during 
the process. 

PLCs will continue to collaborate through inter-visitations. 
Teachers will have their practice observed by rotation, and then 
debrief the session as a group. Best practices will be adopted as a 
model for the PLC.

How  will  your  school  engage  parents/families  and  support  their  understanding  of  Effective  School  Leadership  and 
strategies  to  promote  parent  leadership  and  engagement  in  order  to  support  their  children  at  home?  Include  the 
timeline and identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, 
Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. Bronx Bridges High School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

  providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, 

e.g., literacy, math and use of technology; 

  providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

 

decision making in support of the education of their children; 
fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and

Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing 
technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills; 

  maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the 
Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

Based on the 2016-2017 Quality Snapshot data 93% of parents say that school staff regularly communicate with them 
about how parents can help their child learn. Which is 5% above the city wide average of 87%.  

Based on the 2016-2017 Quality Snapshot data 91% of parents say that they have communicated with their child's 
teacher about their child's performance. This is 8% above the citywide average of 83%.  

As noted on the 2016-2017 Quality Snapshot data a priority need is that only 71% of teachers articulate that they 
work closely with families to meet students need. To continue to build on these achievements and needs, we will 
develop systems and structures for developing stronger family and community ties. For example, we will increase 
awareness of and attendance at citywide parent teacher conferences, ENL new parent orientation and community 
activities which include the campus thanksgiving feast.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies your 
school will implement to achieve the identified goal for this 
Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

Target 
Group(s) 
Who will be 
targeted? 

Timeline 
What is the 
start and 
end date? 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-need 
student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, SIFE, 
STH). 

We will continue to work with our guidance department to support 
students in successfully applying to diverse colleges and universities. 
However we lack a plan for transition students to careers; as a 
result, the transition arm of our attendance team will collaboratively 
work with families of students who are career bound.  

Our Youth and Development team will continue to support 
community ties by supporting our students with transition to such 
programs as YABC.  

We will continue to provide structured time for all adults to engage 
in family engagement during our monthly family engagement time.  

Progress reports will continue to be shared with families via 
personal conversations or teleconferences 

To support community ties, we will develop an attendance team to 
support students who are chronically absent. Ensuring students are 
present and learning. We will develop a comprehensive protocol for 
reaching out to students and families. For example, we will 
introduce such initiatives as WakeUp NYC , scheduled home visits 
and a case-manager approach to supporting chronically absent 
students. 

We will continue our partnership with Good Sheppard as well as 
Monroe college to support the social-emotional as well as the 
academic development of our students.

Section 6: Expanded Learning Time (ELT) Program Description  

 

Directions: Expanded Learning Time activities are directly aligned to the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, 
Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environment, and Strong Family and Community Ties. ELT provides enriching 
educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship-
building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and 
extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring 
that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200 
additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of 
instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in 
grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced 
curriculum that can include ELA, Math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development. Complete the sections 
on this page to demonstrate how the school will meet these requirements.  
 
Part 1 – ELT Program Goal(s) 

Describe the summative goal(s) of the ELT program for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to be 
SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
By June 2019, 65% of students would have a career exploration documented experience allowing them to increase 
their credit accumulation rate by 5%. 

 

 
Part 2 – ELT Program Type  

Is the ELT program voluntary or compulsory? 

 

Voluntary 

X 

Compulsory 

If the ELT program is voluntary, indicate how you will actively encourage the participation of all students, with the 
goal of serving at least 50% of students.  
Each course will have no more than 20 students and have access to a counselor for each course.  

 

 
Part 3 – ELT Program Description  

The ELT program will be offered to all students eligible for Academic Intervention Services (AIS), with the goal of 
serving a minimum of fifty percent of AIS-eligible students. 
Describe how the school will meet the following SED requirements for an ELT program in a Priority School: 
 

Integrate academics, enrichment, and skill development through hands-on experiences that make learning 
relevant and engaging. 

  Offer a range of activities that capture student interest and strengthen student engagement in learning so as to 

promote higher attendance, reduce risk for retention or drop out, and increase the likelihood of graduation. 

  Actively address the unique learning needs and interests of all types of students, especially those who may 

benefit from approaches and experiences not offered in the traditional classroom setting. 

  Contain components designed to improve student academic, social, and emotional outcomes, including 

opportunities for enrichment programs such as in music and art. 

  Ensure instruction in any core academic subject offered in the program will be delivered under the supervision of 

a teacher who is NYS certified in that particular content area. 

  Engage in outreach activities made to families. 

Teachers have proposed academic oriented programs and clubs in multiple academic arenas. Students will have an 
opportunity to select the program of their choice.

4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    

  Assessment Committee that offers input to the section or process of assessments 
  Data review the effectiveness of school-wide and or common assessments 
 

Surveys are conducted on teacher knowledge, comfort, and abilities with specific strategies so appropriate PD 
can provided and inter-visitations can be effectively set-up to encourage specific assessment practices 

  Different assessment strategies are compared so as to determine the most effective strategies and how they 

can be best modified and/or adapted for school-wide use 

  Teachers and teacher teams help design rubrics that effectively assessment students and modify and revise 

based on feedback 

  PD always includes a reflection piece so that all voices are heard in terms of the assessment practices and the 

needed PD. 

  Based on observation of teacher practice for the 2014-15 SY, FAs have been reflected in the PD so that it is 

ongoing and teachers can demonstrate data collection, modification of instruction, and provide targeted 
feedback to students. 

  Ongoing teacher reflection regarding professional growth and development. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent

and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 10: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. 08X432 Bronx Bridges High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title 
I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 
 08X432 Bronx Bridges High School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress;

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

In all classes, QTEL (Quality Teaching to English Learners by Wested) strategies are 
employed.  We use mind mirrors, anticipation guides and semantic word maps. Students rotate 
between heterogeneous groups to homogenous groups, depending on the task at hand. Aside 
from a wide spectrum of QTEL reading, writing, and speaking strategies that are utilized in all 
classrooms, we also incorporate in particular round robins, story circles, save the last word for 
me,  turn and talks, chalk talks, mind mirrors, popcorn reading, snowball discussions, novel ideas 
only, jig saw activities, double entry journals, semantic flowers, and clarifying bookmarks. 
Additionally, we utilize technology based learning through programs such as Rosetta Stone, 
DuoLingo, and Myon.com. The goal is for students to practice all four modalities of 
language  through meaningful interactions with the text and their partners. 
In addition to utilizing QTEL strategies, such as anticipation guides, clarifying bookmarks, 
double-entry journals, and mind mirrors, students are introduced to foundational literacy 
strategies that include Taxonomies – alphabetical lists of terms related to a topic or subject that 
develops skills of categorization, Composing With Keywords - a  strategy of using selected 
words from Taxonomies or text to compose key ideas in sentence or paragraph format, 
Metacognition – self-awareness of one’s knowledge stated in terms such as “I know that I know” 
or “I know that I need to know,” and Defining Format – a three-part template for defining a term 
by asking a question, stating the category, and listing the defining characteristics, while building 
a paragraph of meaning.  These strategies address a wide array of skills including: building and 
expanding vocabulary, clarifying meaning of words, organizing prior, ongoing, and new 
knowledge, developing cooperative and shared learning experiences, using knowledge and 
availability of words promote to better writing, having access to words to build sentence fluency 
and creativity, accessing prior knowledge through conscious awareness, relating prior knowledge 
to new knowledge, and linking knowledge to various subject areas.  Students are grouped both 
heterogeneously and homogeneously, so as to best address specific tasks and class objectives. 
Each modality is addressed daily. Students read aloud in small groups. Students make meaning 
of language through repetition, TPR, and visual support. Students are constantly practicing 
language through all four modalities by working in pairs and/or small group. Also, in order to 
scaffold this learning process, cooperative strategies such as think pair share provide ELLs with 
time to refine their thinking before sharing responses with the whole class. 
We will serve all grades, mainly newcomers and entering level students. 
 
Rationale: 
Cultural immersion can enhance English language instruction. Our students who regularly attend 
the after school English Language Institute will be able to take what they learn in the classroom 
and put it into a real world situation. The ENL teachers will teach a unit around the planned field 
trip. For example, if we take the classes to a historical or cultural play/musical, we will spend a 
unit teaching relevant vocabulary and reading a text to support the play/musical. If we decide to

QTEL materials 
 
ELI: 
After-school program designed to help students improve their English language proficiency and 
move towards English language mastery. This program provides an opportunity to provide direct 
language instruction through creative, enriching activities in. 
Objective: This course is designed to improve ELL’s English language proficiency through 
lessons, exercises, and activities that are specifically intended to build critical listening, writing, 
reading comprehension, and speaking fluency skills. Students will engage in small-group 
discussions, independent writing, collaborative writing workshops, peer-editing workshops and 
independent and whole group readings. 
Advantages: English Language Institute will help students acquire academic language and 
English proficiency. Highly differentiated instruction and support in academic writing, reading, 
speaking, and active listening skills will support students’ academic and English language 
development. 
Frequency of the program/activity: Four times a week 
ENL Teachers: 
Ms. Simoes (ENL) - Monday/Tuesday 
Ms. Alexaki (ENL) - Monday/Tuesday 
Mr. Dogas (ENL) & Ms. To (ELA) - Wednesday 
Mr. Dogas (ENL) - Thursday/Friday 
Duration: 60 minutes per session; 18 weeks 
Types of Materials: Worksheets, notebooks and laptop computers with Internet access, Rosetta 
Stone 
Rationale: ELI operates from 3:35-4:40 pm Monday through Friday. During the class, students 
will receive direct instruction, as well as engage in independent, and small-group, activities and 
projects, aimed at supporting their academic and English language development. 
Students are placed in classes depending on their ELL proficiency level (as determined by the 
NYSITELL and/or NYSESLAT). Depending on the number of entering and emerging students 
needing ELI will determine the classes provided (two entering, two emerging, three entering, one 
emerging, etc.).  The teacher to student ratios is kept as small as possible. 
ELI is monitored the same way a class during the regular school day. Attendance is taken and 
students are encouraged to attend the class everyday. Attendance is recorded on attendance 
sheets by teachers and turned into the attendance coordinator at the school. Students are given 
grades for the class and progress is kept record of in the same way other classes are.

Begin description here:            
Ongoing professional development is a priority at our school. Our teachers attend weekly ELL 
related professional development sessions. Content area teachers also attend professional 
development that will support their instruction of ELLs in their classrooms. This year, teachers 
are participating in professional development aimed at developing their expertise in aligning 
instructional goals to the CCSS. Attendance sheets will be kept by the school secretary. Agendas 
will be kept by the coaching/PD team. 
 
Teachers are also provided with sessions that provide training for topics relevant to all of our 
subgroups. These include testing accommodations, assessing ELA standards and performance 
indicators for ELLs in multiple levels, incorporating strategies for planning and implementing 
the use of academic language in all four modalities in lessons, the needs of our Special Education 
ELLs and differentiating instruction for ELLs in the content areas. 
<!--{cke_protected}%3Cmeta%20charset%3D%22utf-8%22%20%2F%3E--> 
The school leaders ensure that staff are able to develop and offer a Professional Development 
scope and sequence that takes into account student needs and leads to college and career 
readiness for targeted immigrant students by providing the following: 
Professional development sessions and support in the following areas: Understanding by Design 
(or backwards planning), and QTEL (Quality Teaching for English Learners), SIOP (Sheltered 
Instruction Observation Protocol). Sessions specifically designed to support ELLs are conducted 
two times a month. 
Unit and lesson plan templates to ensure coherent and rigorous curriculum that is aligned to the 
Common Core Standards. 
Time during grade team meetings to create interdisciplinary unit plans and projects. 
Opportunities to attend outside professional development trainings, particularly in the area of 
literacy, to further develop a curriculum that addressed various DOK levels of questioning and 
task development. 
Common Core aligned rubrics to monitor student learning, while also serving as a source for 
curriculum adjustment.  Accordingly, each grade team is currently engaged in an inquiry project 
as well as the implementation of various co-teaching models to further improve their curriculum 
development. 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
the school community. We provide monthly workshops alongside our PTA  and SLT meetings, 
which are venues for parents to become actively engaged in their child’s education. As of 
recently, we have collaborated with 21st Century, who are providing us with resources to create 
workshops specifically aligned to meet the needs of our ELL parents, and to be reflective of what 
students are learning throughout the year. The idea is for our workshops to remain relevant; so 
that way, parents and students are learning together, which makes it easier for parents to support 
their child at home. Our first workshop included learning about Pupil Path to communicate with 
teachers and to receive updates on their child’s progress. We were also able to help parents set up 
email accounts. The next couple of workshops will take place 1-2x a month in collaboration with 
our Provider, as well as with our school’s CBO, Good Shepherd Services. 
Notification of parental engagement meetings are translated (translation and interpretation unit -- 
facilitated by Parent Coordinator, Sarah Garrido) and sent out in the language families selected 
on their HLIS.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
NYSESLAT and NYSITEL results are used to group students into beginner, intermediate and advanced level ENL 
classes.  Teachers use these results to develop curriculum and instructional techniques that are appropriate for their specific 
ELL population.  NYSESLAT and NYSITEL results are also used to decide if students should be placed in bilingual content classes 
and if they should be required to stay after school for English Language Institute.  Teacher teams collaborate during weekly 
meetings to develop curriculum and refine instructional techniques for their leveled classes.    
The ENL teachers have created a diagnostic exam that will be given to Entering and Emerging ELLs in stand-alone ENL classes. 
Any newcomers who arrive to Bronx Bridges High School (BBHS) throughout the school year will be given the same initial 
diagnostic. Those students will be given a modified mid-line and end of year diagnostic. The data yielded from these 
assessments will be used by the ENL department to identify the strengths and weaknesses of our students. This information 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             67 

 

will be disseminated in an organized fashion to the rest of the teachers to help guide instructional planning in all disciplines. 
Writing diagnostics created by the ELA department are given to higher level ELLs. This information will be evaluated by the ELA 
and ENL departments. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

On Mondays and Tuesdays during 7th period, co-teachers have common planning time.  This gives ENL, SpEd and content area 
teachers an opportunity to collaboratively participate in instructional planning.  There is extended PD for all pedagogues on 
Wednesday, during grade teams work together to improve instructional planning.  On Thursdays and Fridays during 7th 
period, content teams collaborate to develop curriculum and reflect upon instructional techniques for ELLs.   
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We utilize teacher-created baseline assessments to collect data about reading and writing skills.  These assessments will be 
utilized across all subject areas.  Data about basic language acquisition will be collected within the ENL stand alone classes.  We 
also use information from the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT to program students and inform instructional practices. 
Per the results from the aforementioned assessments, we have identified that, in particular, our students need support with 
speaking and writing.  Teacher teams triangulate data to track progress and target those needs. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Teacher teams triangulate data and then share strategies that have proven effective with literacy building across content 
areas.  We have created a tracking system, where teacher input data and discuss student progress during weekly 7th period 
team meetings.  Teachers analyze student progress, based on informal observations, test results, class work, to determine the 
effectiveness of the intervention.  Students are encouraged to self-assess on their progress.   
Per the results from the aforementioned assessments, we have identified that, in particular, our students need support with 
speaking and writing.  Teacher teams triangulate data to track progress and target those needs. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Our ENL department monitors the data from the EDAT report. We conduct “data dives” at the beginning, middle and end of 
the year to see how our ELLs are progressing. These data dives focus on data from the NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, ELA Regents and 
internal diagnostic assessments. As a department, we look for students who are not progressing on these benchmarks or who 
have regressed in anyway. 
NYSESLAT and ELA results are carefully analyzed to inform programming decisions. For example, 2017 NYSESLAT results are 
used to determine the ELA levels into which students are placed. Entering and emering ELLs are placed into beginner level ELA 
classes; transitioning and expanding ELLs are placed into intermediate level ELA classes and commanding and proficient (and 
some expanding) ELLs are placed into advanced ELA classes. Teachers report that it is easier to provide targeted and 
appropriate challenging instruction for students in leveled classes. 
ELA regents results are also used when making programming decisions. If there is space in their schedule, students who fail the 
ELA regents are placed in an English A class, where they receive additional English support to help them improve their literacy, 
language acquisition, and better prepare for the regents. 
The EDAT is used to identify areas of focus, which include writing and speaking in English. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

We conduct data dives as a department. It is the role of the ENL Coordinator to disseminate these finding to all teachers and 
staff who work with our ELLs. Students who are at risk of becoming long term ELLs or who have regressed in any capacity 
(according to the EDAT) are flagged. It then becomes the duty of all teachers to identify the problem areas for that student and 
to find methods of intervention that are appropriate.

Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Our ENL program is designed to fit the needs of all students of all levels. Our students are homogeneously placed in 
standalone ENL classes, depending on their proficiency level. Entering and Emerging students are grouped together 
and transitioning and expanding students are grouped together. We also integrate ENL services into our ELA and 
social studies classes. Commanding students are placed into more advanced English classes with the continued 
support of an ENL teachers. All ELA classes are co-taught with an ENL teachers with the exception of AP English. 
Commanding students in AP English continue to receive services through stand alone ENL 7 class, which provides 
advanced ENL instruction. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

In the TBE program, all ELLs (per CR Part 154.2) receive one Home Language Arts (HLA) course and one to two 
bilingual content area subjects.  During the 2017-2018 school year, TBE students receive bilingual instruction in 
Statistical Applications of Algebra and/or Living Environment.   In addition, entering and emerging ELLs are grouped 
homogeneously, regardless of grade levels into stand alone ENL classes.  Most ELA classes are co-taught with an ELA 
and ENL teacher, which provides integrated ENL/ELA minutes.  As much as possible, we group students by English 
proficiency into core ELA classes.    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Programmers carefully review ELL proficiency level (according to most recent NYSESLAT or NYSITELL results) to individually 
design program for each student.  During the 2017-2018 school year, our TBE program is for 10th and 11th grade students who 
take bilingual Living Environment, bilingual Statistical Applications of Algebra and HLA in Spanish.  Students are programmed 
to meet mandated TBE or Stand Alone ENL instructional minutes based on proficiency level.   
a.  In the TBE and Stand Alone ENL program, students receive integrated and stand alone classes depending on their English 
proficiency level.  Additionally, students in the TBE program also receive 1 HLA course and 1-2 bilingual courses, depending on 
their proficiency.  As students English proficiency level improves, they receive more instruction in English.  Currently, our TBE 
program is only offered for our native Spanish speaking students.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
All our ELLs receive Common Core aligned curriculum. Students in the ENL entering and emerging levels receive math, science, 
and social studies instruction with the use of ENL strategies.  Where native language support is available, it is provided by the 
teacher.  For students in the advanced ENL levels all content area classes are conducted in English. English is the language of 
instruction for physical education and other electives.  Students have access to Duolingo, which is a language acquisition 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             69 

 

app.  Social studies and science classes incorporate reading and writing common core aligned standards into their units and 
lesson plans. 
We use the workshop model (I do, you do, we do) to deliver instruction. We also use SIOP (Sheltered Instructional Observation 
Protocol) and QTEL (Quality Teaching for English Language Learners).  As students improve their English proficiency, the goal is 
for them to progress toward reading, writing, speaking, and listening in English across content areas.  Ongoing professional 
development opportunities are provided to all teachers across content areas to provide language support. 
In the TBD model, Spanish is the language of instruction. However, teachers foster English language development by providing 
bilingual dictionaries, vocabulary flashcards and materials (worksheets, tests, etc.) in both English and Spanish. The workshop 
model is also utilized in the TBD program. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Our school administered the ELE in May, during the same time as the NYSESLAT.  Students took the LOTE alongside the 
regents’ exams.  Both the LOTE and ELE evaluate students in their home language.  In our bilingual classes, students are 
continuously assessed in their home language.  Labs are translated into Spanish in the Living Environment class.  Our bilingual 
Algebra teacher translates the Algebra textbook into Spanish.  Regents exams are also provided in students’ home language.   
One insight we noticed is that students who are proficient in their home language are more adept at acquiring English 
language skills. Data suggests that SIFE students in particular struggle with language acquisition and literacy. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

SIFE 
There is a SIFE oral interview questionnaire conducted during intake, during which the ENL coordinator asks students about 
the following: their name, birth date, languages spoken, what classes have you taken, how often did you go to school, what is 
the education level of every person in your family, etc. The use of a translator is often necessary. Once SIFE students are 
identified, the rest of the teaching staff is notified. Teachers work with trained ENL pedagogues to use techniques to help SIFE 
students build upon their home language skills before transitioning into ENL. 
Newcomer 
Bronx Bridges High School receives newcomers throughout the school year. They are programmed according to results on the 
NYSITELL exam, which is administered within 10 days of arrival. All teachers of newcomer ELLs used research-based strategies 
in the classroom. They provide differentiated materials, access to technology and other aids to comprehension including the 
use of online reading development programs. 
Developing 
The majority of our students are considered developing ELLs and we work diligently to make sure they do not become long 
term ELLs. Our developing students receive specialized attention in the classroom and out. They are programmed into our 
English Language Institute (ELI) after school. Many of the scaffolds our developing ELLs had when they were entering level ELLs 
is now stripped away. They still receive differentiated instruction but they are encouraged to do much of the thinking on their 
own. 
Long Term 
Our long term ELLs also receive after school ELI courses.  Long term ELLs are placed in English content classes and work with 
ENL teachers to advance their skills. ENL teachers have identified the long term ELLs and develop plans of action to move them 
to the former ELL category. 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status 
Former ELLs remain a priority at Bronx Bridges. They are programmed into twice weekly stand-alone ENL classes if they are not 
getting enough hours in their content courses. Many former ELLs serve as community service aides in lower level ENL classes. 
This not only helps the entering ELLs develop their English language skills but also helps the former ELLs maintain and continue 
to develop. The focus for long term ELLs is on passing regents exams that have to be taken in English. 
 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             70 

 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Access to academic content areas and accelerated English language development is ensured through the use of small group 
instruction (resulting in a smaller student-teacher ratio), common graphic organizers and rubrics, sentence stems/frames, as 
well as dictionaries that include both native language support and graphics to enhance understanding.  Support may also 
include teacher-spoken directions/questions during testing, as well as use of a separate location and smaller groupings to 
enhance focus. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Bronx Bridges utilizes the Integrated Co-Teaching method throughout all Special Education classrooms so that all students are 
able to access the curriculum together.  Groupings in the classroom are flexible and take into account student language needs 
alongside learning disabilities or intellectual differences.  Students are also afforded multiple opportunities to attain credit as 
part of the school’s overall curricular planning. Teachers develop their lesson plans utilizing various scaffolds that promote 
language acquisitions inside the classroom. Bronx Bridges provides students with disabilities who are English Language 
Learners with an opportunity to engage in after-school programs that promote language acquisition. The programs that we 
have available are English Language Institute, Drama club and student government. Additionally, We offer English as a new 
language support services by having ENL teachers support bilingual classes where students with disabilities receive language 
services.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Our school provides English Language Institute (ELI) after school.  ELI consists of small group ENL courses designed to 
accelerate the learning of Entering and Emerging ELLs.  Interventions are provided in English and Spanish.   
ELLs who are risk of failing classes and/or not graduating received academic intervention services.  We have an Academic 
Intervention PLC team, who meets on a weekly basis to identify academically at-risk students, develop intervention strategies 
and discuss student progress.   We offer credit recovery for eligible ELL students who have failed classes from the previous 
semester.  We also provide translators during the regents.  Students can take regents exams in their home language. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We have triangulated data from the EDAT, NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, regents, credit accumulation, and attendance to design 
several new programs for the upcoming school year.  Next year, we will be introducing Restorative Justice curriculum during 
first period advisory classes.  Advisory teachers will be trained in Restorative Justice techniques during pre-service.  This 
curriculum is designed to support our ELL students develop social/emotional skills that will help them succeed in high school 
and beyond.  Each group will have approximately twenty students, who will be grouped based on grade level and gender.  We 
selected this program to address attendance and credit accumulation issues from the 2017-2018 school year. 
We will also be introducing a peer mentoring program, during which new arrivals will be partnered with a current student who 
will help “orient” him/her to our school.  The student mentors will receive a training in the beginning of the year and ongoing 
support.  Student mentors will work closely with the ENL coordinator to help develop the peer mentoring curriculum.   
ELI will be “theme based” next year, which is intended to improve attendance.  Students will be programmed for specific 
theme based on their interests.  The themes will be overarching but will be implemented through reading, writing, listening 
and speaking activities.  Themes for ELI include:  1)  Chess, 2) Social Activism, 3) Music, 4) Crafts, and 5) Newsletter/Yearbook.   
Next year, we will focus on increasing parental involvement.  The ENL team will split the ELL caseload, so each ENL teacher will 
be responsible for approximately 45 students.  Each ENL teacher will schedule and conduct individual parent meetings, during 
which he/she will discuss:  student’s English proficiency and progress, measurable English goals and action plan, and services 
offered.  The ENL coordinator will take the lead with implementing this initiative.   
To further increase parental involvement, we are exploring the possibility of designing a program for parents after school 
and/or on Saturday mornings.  This program may help parents obtain their GED and/or improve their English. Students may be 
involved in designing and implementing curriculum.  The LAP team has decided upon these improvements for next year based 
on observations, student feedback and data analysis. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             71 

 

 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
The majority of our staff is bilingual, which helps maintain positive relationships with parents and offer equal access to 
students.  Our entire student body is comprised of ELLs, so there is equal access to all school programs. All supplemental and 
after school programs are designed to support ELLs by helping them communicate in their native language while also 
improving their English skills.  Our after school and supplemental  programs include: English Language Institute after school, 
Transition to High School, sports programs, student government, after school clubs and several internships. All students in ELI 
are entering or emerging ELLs.  ELLs are invited to participate through individual recruitment efforts, flyers and 
announcements.  Staff members may invite students personally if they feel that a student would benefit from a particular 
program. 
Our supplemental programs include the following: 
Student Government- Extracurricular activity that helps students develop leadership skills and teach students about 
democracy.   
College Now- Students take college level course at Bronx Community College.  Upon passing these classes, they receive college 
credit that is transferable to most colleges. 
Sports- We offer the following sports after school:  basketball, table tennis, softball and soccer 
After school clubs:  Board Game Club, Comic Book/Anime Club, Bengali Student Club, Art Club, Drama Club, Student Activism 
Club 
Internships:  Good Shepherd Services supports our students with obtaining the following internships opportunities:  Life 
Guarding, Cooking, and Geriatric Career Development (GCD) 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
We use Rosetta Stone during ENL stand alone classes, ELA classes and ELI to support ELL students with language 
acquisition.  Student and some parents have Rosetta Stone subscriptions, which they can use from home.  Our school utilizes 
google classroom, myON, content area glossaries, and dictionaries translated into students’ home language to support 
language acquisition for ELLs.  Additionally, all teachers have access to chromebook, which students use to research and 
complete projects.  Our staff is trained in QTEL (protocol for ELLs), which they utilize during class instruction.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In the TBE model, home language is assessed throughout bilingual classes.  Teachers give informal writing and reading 
assessments in Spanish.  Students also give unit project presentations in Spanish. Textbooks are also available in Spanish and 
English.   
For students in both TBE and stand alone ENl programs, letters that we send home are translated in home language.  Teachers 
in both program models support students with multilingual word walls, where words are translated into students’ home 
languages.   Students’ home language is informally assessed in ENL classes as well.   
For new Spanish speaking students, we administer NYSITELL and then the Spanish LAB. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  
We use the EDAT, NYSESLAT and NYSITELL results along with students’ ages and grade level to inform individual student 
programs.  We carefully program students for ELI, ENL, ELA, HLA, bilingual classes, etc., based on students’ foreign transcript (if 
applicable), age, grade and test results.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Teachers from our school share teaching resources (bilingual glossaries, textbooks, translated labs, teaching strategies) with 
staff members from other schools in our building. 
 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             72 

 

 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We host orientation sessions for new parents and students over the summer, during which students take an English and math 
baseline assessment and learn about our school’s policies and procedures.   
For next year, our ENL coordinator and our bilingual math teacher are collaborating to develop curriculum and protocol for a 
peer mentoring program designed to welcome new ELL students.  They are also developing selection criteria for mentors.  The 
ENL coordinator is planning to pilot mentoring program for new arrivals over the summer to solidify the peer mentoring 
curriculum for next year.  Current staff members were introduced to peer mentoring proposal during staff PD on June 8th. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish is the only language elective currently offered. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
All returning ENL teachers and some content teachers have attended QTEL training in San Francisco. Those teachers are 
responsible for turn keying the information to the rest of the building. ENL teachers also attend a number of DOE led 
professional development sessions throughout the school year. This knowledge is also transferred to the rest of the staff. 
All BBHS teachers engage in weekly professional development meetings. The ENL department plans together and shares 
strategies. They in turn provide these strategies to the other teachers who work with the ELL population. All strategies are 
aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and the Bilingual Common Core Progressions 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
All teachers engage in a professional planning period four times a week, where they collaborate with other instructors to 
improve their teaching methodology.  Agenda and attendance records are kept for each meeting.  Every Wednesday after 
school, staff members engage in professional development activities and parent outreach after school.  At least 50% of our PDs 
and planning periods specifically relate to servicing ELLs.  Additionally, staff members attend professional development 
workshops off site on an as needed basis.  Seven teachers will be attending QTEL training this summer.  Each staff member 
who attends this training will lead two PDs during the school year about QTEL strategies.  Completion of QTEL training is 
equivalent of 40 hours of PD.  Staff members are also trained in SIOP, where language and content objectives are aligned.  A 
“menu” of other ELL-specific strategies are taught during PD, which are outlined below. Agendas are kept in google drive and 
hard copies are available upon request.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
As previously mentioned, we plan to increase parental involvement next year.  The ENL team will split the ELL caseload, so 
each ENL teacher will be responsible for overseeing approximately 45 families.  Each ENL teacher will schedule and conduct 
individual parent meetings, during which each teacher will discuss: student’s English proficiency and progress, measurable 
English goals and action plan, and services offered.  The ENL coordinator, with support from the Parent Coordinator, will take 
the lead with implementing this initiative. 
In addition, we meet with parents during parent orientation meetings and DOE schedule parent-teacher conferences.  Our 
Parent Coordinator is bilingual in English and Spanish and provides translation as necessary.  We also have an Arabic speaking 
teacher, who provides translation.  The DOE Translation and Interpretation Unit is also utilized on an as needed basis.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parents, all of whom are ELLs, are involved through the Parent Teacher Association. The School Leadership Team (SLT) has 
monthly meetings.  During the 2017-2018 school year, Bronx Bridges will continue distributing Rosetta Stone subscriptions to 
parents to support their language acquisition. Stevenson Campus library, 21st Century, and DreamYard are collaborating to 
host a monthly family game day, where they will engage in activities such as online board game and crafts. The Bronx Bridges 
Parent Coordinator is collaborating with Good Shepherd Services to host the following workshops after school: immigration 
rights, resume writing, technology (parents will learn how to navigate pupil path and Skedula), college awareness. These 
workshops are specifically designed to foster ELL parental involvement. Parent are made aware of these events through flyers 
(translated into their home language), personal phone calls, robo calls, and word of mouth. 
 
Bronx Bridges is increasing parental involvement by actively recruiting members to join the PTA and attend upcoming 
workshops. Bronx Bridges has an open door policy for parents, where they can drop in and meet with the parent coordinator 
on an as needed basis. The Parent Teacher Coordinator and Youth Development Team makes 100+ personal phone calls to 
parents every day to communicate about attendance issues and academic related concerns and successes. During the 2017-
2018 school year, the SLT is exploring having Saturday GED and/or English language acquisition workshops for parents.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Nelsie Castillo, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

During Freshmen orientation and through out the school year we have families fill out the Language Preference 
Survey as well as Parent/Teacher conferences and face-to-face meetings. 
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A. 
 

None. 

 

 
 
Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services 
 
1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be 

distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.  
 

Document Name  

Month/Frequency Distributed to 

How do you plan to translate? 

On a monthly basis we mail out 
calendars and letters to parents 
sharing the latest information and 
workshops offered at the school, 
together with flyers promoting these 
events. All documents are translated in 
the family's native language. Also, our 
website is updated on a weekly basis 
with all the information, and it has a 
translation link.  

The Student Handbook for incoming 
Freshmen and New Students was 
distributed during Freshman and 
Parent Orientation, and will continue 
to be distributed throughout the 
school year. Furthermore, the DOE’s 
Achieve NYC guide was also distributed 
in family preferred language, which 
proved to be a key resource in helping 
to guide families through our 

Families  

Once every month 

Include procedures to ensure timely 
provision of translated documents to 

parents.  

All documents will be translated into 
the preferred languages of the 
students we service. This will be done 
through the DOE’s translation unit. 

Distributed during Freshmen and Parent 
Orientation on the following dates: 
07/26/17; 07/28/17; and upcoming for 
08/09/17. 

The Student Handbook is available in 
English and has been translated by 
bilingual school personnel in Spanish. 
We intend to have this booklet 
translated into the preferred 
languages of all the students we 
service- via the NYC DOE’s 
Translation and Interpretation Unit (T 
& I Unit).

presentation and overall 
communication; especially as it so 
conveniently complemented the 
Student Handbook and Power Point 
presentation-currently only available in 
English and Spanish. 

The Parent Coordinator’s Welcome 
Letter and Family Survey: The PC will 
initially send out her ‘Welcome’ letter 
to families, introducing herself and 
providing some basic information 
about the upcoming year and 
important dates to keep in mind. 
Additionally, the PC will inform parents 
of their language access rights and 
provide information about services 
provided. A brief questionnaire will 
also be attached, aiming to capture 
parent/family needs and interests. We 
will be sending out additional 
questionnaires throughout the year, 
focused on feedback from families- as 
a means to evaluate our workshops, 
quality of service, and efficiency in 
communication strategies; amongst 
other things. 

Monthly Newsletters for Parents and 
announcements: We plan on providing 
families with monthly newsletters 
describing events, workshops, and 
important dates to keep in mind; 
including PA/PTA meetings, Parent-
Teacher Conferences, Curriculum 
Night, etc 

To be distributed throughout the first 
week of September. The subsequent 
feedback surveys will be sent out once 
every month, beginning after our first 
Parent Workshop. 

The PC’s Welcome Letter is currently 
available in English and Spanish. The 
PC intends to have this letter 
translated in the preferred languages 
of all the families we service, through 
the NYC DOE’s Translation and 
Interpretation Unit (T & I Unit). We 
will therefore begin to put in a 
request for this translation within the 
next two weeks, in order to have it 
ready before school begins. 

Newsletter to be distributed 1/mo., as 
well as additional announcements 
regarding parent workshops and 
PA/PTA meeting dates.  

 
Announcements for PT Conference for 
Fall Semester - November 19 & 20. 
Spring Semester - March 10 & 11 should 
be sent out 2 weeks before these 
specified dates. 

 

We will use the DOE generated 
templates found via the DOE intranet 
for invitation templates and other 
related forms. We will utilize school-
based personnel, parent volunteers, 
and CBO’s for any additional support 
required. Additionally, we will 
request translation services from the 
DOE T & I unit for translating 
newsletters and info on workshops. 
We aim to begin our first newsletter 
after our first workshop, which is set 
for the last week of August. 

 

 

 

Intake Documents: Emergency Blue 
cards, Parent Survey, Residency 
questionnaire, Home Language 
Identification Survey, etc 

Required intake forms have been 
prepared and distributed since the first 
Freshman & Family Orientation that was 
held on 07/26/17, and continues to be 
distributed.  

We find these required forms 
translated in all preferred languages 
for our families via the DOE intranet

who do not speak English, for all 
meetings, including Parent 
Workshops. 

 
We will also use the Language Line to 
communicate with parents if a 
translator is not immediately 
available. 

 
We will also utilize school-based 
personnel, parent volunteers, and/or 
CBO’s for interpretation support. 

 

We used school-based personnel to

communicate with students who do 
not speak English. 

We will also utilize the Language Line, 
if necessary, when calling parents to 
inform them about the event. 

 

   

 

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.

In the event of an emergency, BBHS is prepared to communicate with the limited English proficient families through 
the Language Line. Post emergency, we are prepared to have information translated and disseminated to all families 
in their language of preference. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

During the first days of the 2017-2018 school year, all staff members will be informed of the regulation. They will be 
given a packet of information that includes access to the DOE’s translation unit, the Language Line, and other 
resources. We will also disseminate the selected language preference for each and every student in the school. 
Teachers, staff and students will be reminded that students are not allowed to be used for translation purposes. 
Contact information for the LAC and ENL Coordinator will be made readily available for staff members if there are any 
additional questions or concerns relating to translations. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

After completing the home language survey, parents and students home language is indicated on ATS. During monthly 
and Saturday workshops, parents are given workshops on their rights and language access. All staff and adults in the 
building are then informed of parent's preferred language.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

On a yearly basis we receive the school surveys that we utilize to obtain feedback from our families. We also have an 
open door policy where parents can come in and obtain information and required services to help their student
