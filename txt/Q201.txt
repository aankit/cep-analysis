Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Mission 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

At P.S. 201Q, we use an inquiry-based approach to learning that is aligned with 21st century thinking. We believe as 
a school, we must build strong foundations that support critical learning and innovation through high levels of 
student engagement, collaboration, critical thinking and problem solving and student ownership of their learning. 
We believe that in order to foster productive citizens of the world, we must incorporate in these strong 
foundations a focus on social/emotional supports as well as cultural and civic responsibilities. We must also ensure 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

that we foster our beliefs in equity, in meeting the diverse needs of our learners and providing access through 
supports, resources and high expectations for all students. We believe that we learn and grow as a school when we 
engage in inquiry to support our professional growth. We believe that we will learn and grow as a school through 
effective use of data, strategic planning and delivery of professional learning opportunities designed to the learning 
needs of individual staff members. We believe that in order to nurture strong roots and a strong school, we must 
work alongside our families and foster meaningful partnerships that support student achievement and build 
successful pathways towards college, careers and beyond. 

 

Vision 

We will build 21st century thinking skills through: 

  opportunities that support high levels of student engagement, critical thinking, problem solving, creativity 

and student ownership of their learning 
integrating social/emotional and academic learning 

 
  effective monitoring systems and the strategic and consistent use of data to support decision making 
 

structured, strategic planning and effective delivery of professional learning opportunities which include 
inquiry work that support our professional growth 
investing in family and community relationships to build successful pathways toward college, careers and 
beyond 
fostering and involving cultural contexts within learning 

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
The Discovery School for Inquiry and Research, a federal magnet school, is nestled in a quiet cul-de-sac in Flushing, 
Queens, New York. Surrounded by Pomonok playground, a basketball and tennis court, this setting provides rich 
opportunities for learning within an aesthetically pleasing context. Every classroom is furnished with a Smart 
board, laptops, iPads and numerous desktop computers, making technology readily accessible. Dotted with 
examples of student work across the content areas, our hallways provide a showcase for the work that is taking 
place within our classrooms. The tone of the building is calm and welcoming. 

Our Robin Hood Library houses more than 10,000 new books, magazines and periodicals. It is also equipped with a 
Smartboard, desktop computer center, mobile laptop cart, and ample seating for reading and research. Several 
years ago our school welcomed students to a completely refurbished technology lab, equipped with 30 new MAC 
desktop computers and 3 color laser printers. This equipment was funded by a $350,000 grant from our local 
Councilman. 

Funded by a federal Magnet grant, the most exciting updates are our newly constructed STEAM Lab and our 
Broadcasting Studio (opened September 2017). P.S. 201Q is currently the only NYC elementary school to offer a 
learning lab of this calibre. Our STEAM Lab allows students the opportunity to make their inquiry and active 
research come alive. Students create models, see their designs come to life via 3D printing, and engage in coding. 
They learn computer science and robotics. Further, our STEAM theme is implemented in all classrooms via the use 
of new mobile STEM carts, laptop carts and iPads. The rich resources offered provide students opportunity to 
showcase their innovations for the community at large. 

Our most recent January 2016 Quality Review resulted in a “Well Developed” rating. Our strong literacy core 
buttresses our inquiry-based social studies and science trans-disciplinary units that are aligned to meet the New 
York State Common Core Learning Standards. Every student in P.S. 201Q is provided access to performing arts. 
Through the creative and strategic use of resources, the school employs a full-time Music/Arts teacher and a full-

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

time Dance teacher. Every student is afforded the opportunity to learn keyboarding, via a grant from Music and the 
Brain, study art and learn self-expression via dancing and movement.  

Learning continues outside the school day through before and after-school offerings. AM Academy for ELA & Math 
offer select upper grade students access to targeted instruction to help prepare them for the New York State ELA 
and Math Assessments. Our ENL students are also provided with supplementary early-morning instruction to 
prepare them for success on the NYSESLAT. In May and June 2018, third and fourth grade students identified as 
struggling in ELA and/or Math were invited to participate in an A.M. ELA Clinic and/or P.M. Math Clinic where they 
learned strategies to support their acquisition of grade-level standards in an attempt to prepare them to tackle the 
new school year with increased confidence. 

P.S. 201Q collaborates with a CBO, Best Prep After-School Program, to provide students the opportunity to 
participate in an extended day program. Best Prep provides homework assistance and physical education to 
approximately 40 students 2:30 p.m. -5:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. Additionally, many of our students attend 
Pomonok After-School Program in the nearby Pomonok Center. Here, they receive homework help and participate 
in physical activities under the guidance of trained counselors. Aside from external offerings, our students 
participate in a wide array of after-school activities within the building including Chorus, Shakespeare Players, 
Basketball, Cheerleading and Stars Dance Company. These in-school activities draw upon the expertise of school 
faculty and support our vision of providing a holistic education to all students within our school community, no 
exceptions.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our school houses two classes for visually-impaired students whose needs extend beyond those of the general 
education population. In order to cater to our students’ diversity, our staff includes specially licensed personnel 
including vision teachers, mobility teachers and teachers of braille. Vision students are integrated into general 
education classes, whenever possible, thus increasing our students’ opportunities to work alongside general 
education students, their peers. 

At P.S. 201Q, we constantly monitor student progress and pay specific attention to our special needs students in 
order to ensure they are meeting the Common Core Learning Standards and are provided ACCESS to the general 
education curriculum. For those specific students who are struggling and reading far below grade level, we provide 
them with explicit instruction through the daily implementation of Leveled Literacy Intervention. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Based on results of the most recent School Quality Review, PS 201Q has grown in the area of collaborative 
teachers. During common planning time and professional learning opportunities, teachers are meeting to plan 
rigorous lessons, analyze student work, and review plan the area of the Framework for Great Schools in which we 
Teachers at P.S. 201 are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. Teachers

teacher teams created within our building to improve  

PS 201 historically has had low parent involvement. Through collaborative efforts between the principal, PTA, 
Parent Coordinator and staff developer has increased the number of activities that include parents into school 
activities. Last year a new parent center was opened with computers and a schedule that highlights enrichment 
activities for parents. Activities include, creating email accounts and basic computer skills. Our parent coordinator 
has invited speakers to come to our school to provide workshops on identity theft, stress management, cookshop, 
scrapbooking, and various other events. Also, our staff developer has provided numerous workshops for parents 
regarding instruction and assisting their children with schoolwork. This school year the creation of the “Principal’s 
Book Club” was started for families and friends of our community. Our parent coordinator works cohesively with 
administration to provide additional opportunities to involve parents that are not available during school hours the 
ability to participate. This year PS 201 has offered several evening events such as Family Bingo Night, and Wheel of

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
1. According to our Quality Review Report (2016), there is evidence of rigorous instruction in the majority of 
classrooms. However, student performance on NYS Assessments in ELA & Math does not reflect effective 
instructional practices that lend themselves to student advancement. The most recent NYC School Survey (2018) 
indicates that teacher collaboration is growing, thus indicating a willingness of teachers to work together as a team 
to support their students. Guiding teachers to more effective collaboration is a natural next step.  

2. In terms of priority needs, analysis of reading levels indicates that many students in the lower grades need 
additional work in phonics and foundational awareness for reading and writing. To address this challenge, the 
Fundations curriculum will be implemented in all lower grade classrooms. Further, F & P data indicates that many 
students do not move from one reading level to another as per grade-level expectations. Therefore, teachers will 
be trained to implement Guided Reading to meet students where they are and elevate their reading growth. 
Further, a review of NYSESLAT data indicates that a deeper dive into instructional strategies using multiple entry 
points is urgently needed in order to address the needs of the variety of student sub groups across K-5 classrooms. 
There is a further need to strengthen language acquisition via a focus on academic language and structure. Post-
unit tests in mathematics provide evidence that students in Grades K-5 have difficulty in completing multi-step 
problems within their Go Math mathematics lessons. Students struggle in scaffolding the language of problems, 
identifying the correct operation, completing a multi-step problem and expressing themselves using mathematical 
language. Moving forward, we will expand upon teacher planning, task design and pedagogical skills to align 
instruction to the CCLS and to create a positive mindset toward mathematics in all students. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
Rigorous Instruction: 

By June 2018-2019, we will build “Strong Roots” and support a vision of equity and excellence for all students in ELA 
through the implementation of a “Theory of Action” to build and deepen students’ foundational skills, cultivate 
critical thinking and encourage lifelong learning. Aligned professional learning, supports to incorporate culturally 
responsive classroom experiences, collaborative planning, maximizing instructional time, data driven instruction, as 
well as strategic enrichment and interventions will result in an 8% increase in the number of students moving one risk

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
During Family-Engagement Time each Tuesday, families will be invited to a variety of workshops designed to better 
their understanding of instructional expectations across the grades. These workshops will be tailored to support 
parents as they work with their children at home, guiding them in developing a love of reading in their children and 
providing them with resources to support this work. Another area of focus will be garnering parent support in the 
development of computational fluency. We will offer workshops that highlight math in the environment and guide 
parents in utilizing opportunities to increase their children’s mathematical abilities outside the school environment.  

Parents/Families will also be invited to participate in student work showcases & gallery walks across the year to 
familiarize them with the learning that is going on inside our classrooms and provide them with ideas for 
extensions in the home environment. Further, they will be kept abreast of resources for learning via Remind 
messages, flyers and our new school website. 

Parent workshops will be facilitated by our Literacy Staff Developer and Math Instructional Coach around our new 
initiatives and instructional focus. 

We utilize the Kinvolved App to communicate attendance to families on a daily basis. The system allows us to track 
data regarding attendance, lateness and parent communication. 

We have partnered with the Pomonok Community Center and their after school program to provide training and 
resources to their staff and parents around reading and supporting students with their homework. 

The principal's open forum provides parents with up-to-date information about our school's initiatives and 
instructional focus. This forum also allows parents the opportunity to ask questions and voice their opinions.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 

This year’s goal builds upon the work of 2017-1 by continuing to purposely target our lowest 
performing students in English Language Arts. A significant number of our students perform far 
below grade level in ELA. To deepen and broaden our commitment to closing the achievement 
gap, we will provide targeted academic intervention services using a Response to Intervention 
(Rti) model within a supportive learning environment. 
 

Data from P.S. 201's 2017-18 NYS ELA and Math report shows positive trends for all students in 
ELA; however, we must continue to improve educational outcomes for ‘at-risk’ students in English 
Language Arts. The subgroups of English Language Learners (ELLs), Students with Disabilities 
(SWDs) and African American Boys have historically been the majority of students performing at 
Level 1 and 2 in ELA at PS 201. In order to reduce the number of students performing at Level 1 in 
English Language Arts, we will continue to provide targeted Academic Intervention Services (AIS) 
programs within the school day using the Response to Intervention Model (Rti). Interventions 
following the Response to Intervention (Rti) plan occur in a three (3) tiered approach. Tier I 
interventions occur at the classroom level with the classroom teacher. At the Tier I level, lessons 
should be differentiated for students based on learning styles and instructional need. Teachers 
must insure that identified students are provided with Tier I interventions for a minimum of three 
(3) times each week. 

Tier I interventions are as follows:  

● Small group instruction such as strategy lessons, guided reading, guided writing, shared/close reading, component 
work, fluency, and word study 

Teachers will monitor the progress of students receiving Tier I interventions every six weeks. For this purpose, we 
have created an online progress monitoring system on the shared PS 201 Google Drive. The dates for Progress 
Monitoring are December 4, January 22, March 11 and May 6. Students who are progressing well in Tier I 
interventions will have those services reduced or removed. Students, who are not making progress with Tier I 
interventions, will be moved to Tier II interventions based on the outcome of a Pupil Personnel Committee (PPC) 
meeting. Tier II interventions will be scheduled for a minimum of three (3) times each week. 

Tier II interventions are as follows:  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          19 

 

● Lexia, RazKids, Leveled Literacy Intervention (LLI), Student progress in Tier II interventions will be recorded on the 
school website, using a simple drop down menu in six-week intervals. Students who are progressing well with Tier II 
interventions will have their services reduced or removed. Students, who are not making good progress with Tier II 
interventions, will be moved to Tier III interventions based on the outcome of a PPC meeting. 

Tier III interventions are as follows: 

● AIS reading, AIS math, At-risk speech, At-risk SETSS Students who are progressing well in Tier III interventions will 
have those services reduced or removed. Students, who are not making progress with Tier III interventions, will be 
referred for an educational evaluation based on the outcome of a Pupil Personnel Committee (PPC) meeting. We will 
also continue to track the performance of at risk students in ELA periodically to determine the effectiveness of our 
programs and interventions, so that we can add or revise services. We have, therefore, created this school goal to 
insure the continued academic improvement of at risk students in English Language Arts. This model for academic 
intervention ensures that students are being educated in a supportive environment. Using PBIS and Kids at Hope, 
teachers provide academic intervention in classrooms and within a school culture where students feel safe, 
supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
Supportive Environment: 

 

By June 2019, we will foster a Supportive Environment and build “Strong Roots” through the implementation of a 
“Theory of Action” and a clearly stated vision for Social Emotional Learning with aligned professional learning that 
fosters increased attendance and participation in learning and social emotional growth as measured by the school-
wide PBIS Tiered Fidelity Inventory and the Kinvolved Attendance Program, resulting in a 10% reduction in lateness 
and 3% reduction in level 3 and 4 infractions reported on the Online Occurance Reporting System.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The most recent 2016 Quality Review indicates that the school has worked with the common core aligned Ready-
Gen Reading program for four years and is also in year four of the Go Math program. Each year, in response and 
direct alignment to student academic needs revealed within state and school based assessments, the 
administration and teacher teams have made deliberate adjustments to the curricula in order to more effectively 
isolate and adjust gaps identified within all content area curriculum maps. To maintain alignment to the standards 
and the instructional shifts and coherence within and across grades, school leaders and teachers use standardized 
practices to determine areas for growth pulled from data trends including student work. Once students’ strengths 
and weaknesses are identified, teachers develop action plans and modify curriculum, anticipate impact of curricula 
changes on student learning and create targeted tasks to monitor student growth in focused areas. 

Further, as part of the curricula design and modification process, tasks are planned to provide all students with 
access to the curriculum and require that they demonstrate deep higher- order thinking. In every classroom, 
students have access to curriculum aligned strategic charts, checklists, grade appropriate conversation prompts and 
question stems, inquiry boards, mentor texts, vocabulary supports, manipulative tools and problem-solving 
planning grids. These focused resources are yielding increased student outcomes for struggling learners as 
evidenced in student work portfolios and school wide math and literacy assessments. 

In support of school wide goals of increasing student learning outcomes and building a strong community culture, 
the principal strategically aligns budget, technology and partnerships to ensure students are nurtured and well 
supported in their learning. To develop skills required of 21st century learners, the school has a full time technology 
program and school lab where curriculum and student work products are maintained in “tech folios” and directly 
aligned to curriculum in all content areas. Additionally, SMART boards and computer carts are available for use in 
the classroom and support the individualized software and web based programs and games the school uses to 
provide interventions to students. Community collaborations with Materials for the Arts, Queens College, China’s 
Advantage and Tsu Chi provide access to additional arts, science and language programs.  

The school program is structured to allow for common planning time four to five periods per week. Teachers are 
currently utilizing this time to analyze student work and schools based assessments and have developed tasks to 
focus on identified content or skill based weaknesses. The principal and staff use this data to form targeted 
intervention classes to address and monitor the specific needs of students. As a result of this programmatic 
structure, performance assessments are demonstrating student growth in comprehension skills and movement 
towards reading at grade level and increased student conceptual understanding of key math concepts ensuring 
improved student outcomes and preparation for the next grade level 

The school uses common assessment tools such as base, mid and end line unit tasks and tests in all content areas, 
running records to measure reading growth, and a school based writing assessment aligned to opinion based 
writing standards. Teacher teams and the school administration consistently analyze student tasks and assessment 
outcomes and track student progress through analysis of traits that represent standard bearing work products. For 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          23 

 

example, a second grade informative writing performance assessment measured student progress using focus, 
structure, development, word knowledge, punctuation and explanation of reading traits. Student progress was 
tracked by trait and class allowing for both grade and class analysis of student learning outcomes as well as 
alignment of curricula to the standards. 

Within the goal setting process, the principal works with the assistant principals and instructional team to structure 
and communicate high expectations and supports in order to move the learning needs of the school forward. 
Beginning in June, the administration and staff reflect on student response to the instructional core and they set 
curricular and instructional expectations together. School leaders and teacher peers then align this work to an 
instructional focus, the Danielson framework and the school wide and individual professional development plans. 
At multiple points in the year, the principal and teacher teams monitor progress and develop reports with 
supporting teacher tools to address both strengths and weaknesses identified regarding the instructional core, 
school culture and the school's vision for improvement. For example, this year the school focus to strengthen data-
driven planning that promotes substantial student engagement and requires students to make their thinking visible 
is demonstrated through more rigorous student discussions and the shared reading protocol within classrooms. 
This work is embraced and reinforced by staff leading to a culture of mutual accountability to increase student 
outcomes. 

What the school needs to improve 

Expand upon teacher planning, task design and pedagogical skills to align to core concepts within the curriculum so 
students develop a deep understanding within and across subject areas to improve student outcomes. (1.2) 

Although there is evidence across classrooms to support the school wide belief that students learn best through 
opportunities to reflect on learning experiences and by providing options in tasks and tools to support inquiry and 
active research reflective in student class work, and this is consistent across classrooms, in some classrooms, 
deeper planning is required to convey clear and accurate relationships between skills, concepts, expectations and 
instructional outcomes to better align to the rigor of the school's curriculum and assessment practices. For example 
in one classroom visited, although the teacher engaged students in high level question scaffolds, provided multiple 
entry points for struggling learners, task boards for advanced students and aligned the objective of the lesson to 
both content and community book themes, evidence of planning was around the activity the students were asked 
to complete, thus not deepening student understanding of key concepts or content, resulting in missed 
opportunities to fully elevate student learning outcomes. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
Collaborative Teachers: 

We will build “Strong Roots” and support a vision of Equity and Excellence for All in ELA through the implementation 
of a “Theory of Action” that supports systems and structures within two inquiry studies that focus on building teacher 
content knowledge and pedagogy, resulting in a minimum of a 10% increase in the number of teachers receiving 
"Effective" or "Highly Effective" ratings in 1a (Demonstrating Knowledge of Content & Pedagogy) & 1e (Designing 
Coherent Instruction) from September 2018 to June 2019 as well as a 5% decrease in the achievement gap of targeted 
subgroups on the NYS ELA assessment.

school’s instructional focus and a vision of equity and excellence for all resulting in at least a 5% improvement in 
student attendance, an 8% increase in the number of students moving one risk level in grades K-2 as measured by 
Fountas and Pinnell testing levels and an 8% increase in ELA proficiency in grades 3-5 as measured by the NYS ELA 
assessment.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Monthly PTA meetings include presentations to parents on 
relevant current topics. Working toward developing trust among 
the parent community is fostered via the accessibility of the 
Parent Center. Parents feel respected and can trust that they 
have a place that is their own. 

Parents will be introduced to new initiatives; Thinking Maps, 
Guided Reading, Foundations curriculum, Tear II Vocabulary 
Curriculum, Shared Reading Protocol, Math Problem Solving 
Protocol, Thinking routines as well as grade-specific common 
core curriculum via the housing of Parent Workshops during 
Tuesday's Parent engagement sessions and various parent 
professional development sessions.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
The Administrative Team strives to ensure that each student within PS201 is provided with opportunities to learn 
from competent educators across the day. Always focusing on the future, we consistently review our substitute 
‘bank’ in an effort to source excellence and employ only those teachers who consistently demonstrate 
professionalism. We pride ourselves on being a school where faculty transience is practically non-existent, a place 
where teachers are encouraged to advance on their journey as lifelong learners regardless of their years of 
experience. 

The following serves as examples of ongoing opportunities for professional learning ensuring staff members are 
highly qualified: 

● Instructional cabinet designed a hiring rubric used as a lens to recruit highly qualified faculty members. 

*Strategically pairing highly effective teachers to teachers in need of support. 

*Extensive training has been planned in order to support teachers in challenging assignments by our full time 
Instructional Coach. 

*Our faculty members collaboratively make decisions around the ongoing Professional Development in the area of 
literacy. The planned professional learning opportunities are offered by specialist in our staff, selected consultants 
and/or our in-house Instructional Staff Developer. This work is supplemented via collaboration with Queens 
College whereby teachers are working in conjunction with professors to improve literacy through the content area 
of science. 

● Teachers across the school are provided with support in developing systems to support the implementation of 
differentiated instruction through attendance at off-site workshops and in-house Lesson Study groups including 
membership of an Inquiry Team. 

● Teachers are provided with a menu of professional development workshops from which to choose those that 
best meet their needs and professional growth. Workshops are facilitated by the Administrative Team, Lead 
Teachers, and Teachers & Coaches and take place either before or after school. In cases where teachers need one-

on-one support, the math coach provides in-class demonstration lessons and meets with individual teachers during 
their planning periods. The coach also addresses key instructional issues during monthly grade-level conferences. 

● Training in the implementation of Go Math and Problem Solving Math protocols is provided by consultants at the 
beginning of the school year and continue as the year progresses. Our Instructional staff developer meets with 
teachers of grades 3-5 to analyze the results of MOSL Assessments, On-Demands, Unit tests and to plan for next 
steps in instruction. It is our continued effort to make certain that teachers are growing professionally ensuring that 
they remain highly qualified .  

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
A professional learning menu was created offering workshops that address the needs of staff in supporting the 
academic, social and emotional needs of students across the grades. Teachers were then given choices in the 
selection of professional development options they felt best supported their professional growth. Workshops were 
tiered to address proficiency levels and were offered before, during and after the school day. In this way, staff 
members can feel confident that the sessions they attend are customized to participant needs. In an effort to build 
capacity, workshops are facilitated by our Administration, instructional staff developer, Grade Teachers, Guidance 
Counselor, technology teacher, and Dean of Students. This list of facilitators is not exclusive as many teachers also 
facilitate workshops highlighting their particular strengths and areas of interest. In addition to this, Administration 
utilizes monthly Grade-Level Conferences as a forum to further the learning experiences of staff members keeping 
them abreast of new initiatives and providing them with access to best practices such as those available at Google-
Docs. The staff of PS 201 is also fortunate to have opportunity for in-house professional learning sessions from our 
Instructional Cabinet specialist. Such work helps to fine tune their instructional practices in the teaching of 
balanced literacy across the day. Additionally, across the school year teachers attend workshops at partnering 
schools facilitated by our Instructional Cabinet and turnkey their learning to colleagues at Professional learning 
opportunities on Mondays and designated Professional Development Days. Administration participates in 
professional development offerings hosted by the Executive Leadership Institute as well.

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
 

Students transitioning from preschool undergo a program entitled Early Intervention. Pre-K teachers have 
developed thematic curriculum maps embedding the standards. All other core subjects use in house curriculum 
developed by our teachers with the support of our Lead teachers. The parents of PS 201 are fortunate to have an in 
house Social worker that provides ongoing Professional Development. Topics vary according to the needs of our 
school wide community. 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Conducting a comprehensive needs assessment is an essential component of the cycle of continuous improvement 
planning process at our school. Our effective school improvement planning contributes to overall school 
performance by: 

 

 

collaborating with the Instructional Cabinet members around establishing an understanding of the "big 
picture" of our school's current state, including our student's achievement, school culture, teacher 
community, parent involvement and even organizational concerns; 

  we reach a consensus across the school community on which needs represent the highest priority. 
  We identify our annual SMART goals and planned implementation strategies, including specific targets, 

indicators and milestones required to address identified needs. 

  Teachers collaboratively choose which assessments are most beneficial in gauging student advancement. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the

participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student 
achievement. The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective 
involvement of parents and community in the school. PS 201Q, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, ESSA 
initiative, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection 
and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep 
parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their 
children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and 
Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

PS 201Q will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 
decision making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through 
school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, 
and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school. 

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the 
school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies 
as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical 
support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills; 

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of 
the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming 
and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for 
parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support 
services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESEA /State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents 
of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be 
involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other 
applicable sections under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the 
Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed; 

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events;

Based on this data analysis, the goal of our Title III program is to enhance and/or accelerate 
literacy and English language skills for our English language learners through differentiated 
instruction and accelerated learning to support them in their academic learning and help to ensure 
that they are on track to become college and career ready as described in the Chancellor’s 
initiatives and the Learning Standards. 
The following supplementary programs and materials have been carefully reviewed and selected 
to target the needs of our ELLs. In addition to purchasing some online programs, we will utilize 
the Title III funds to pay teachers per session.

●       30 minutes of Independent Reading 
                                                                         After School Program 
 
Our After School Program is scheduled to start on November 21, 2018 and to end on March 1, 
2019. Classes will meet between 2:30 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. on Wednesdays, Thursdays and 
Fridays. The program will run for 36 sessions, with two (1.5) hours of instruction and learning 
each session. There will be one (1) class, with a fifteen (15) students. One (1) certified ENL 
teacher will be working the program.  The program is geared towards 4th and 5th grade ELLs 
who scored level 1 on the ELA and/ or Math state tests. 
  
In the after school program, students will be provided with: 
●       45 minutes of instruction using Lexia Blended Learning Platform 
●       45 minutes of Differentiated Math Workshop 
 
Lexia Blended Learning Platform 
 
The goal of our After School and Saturday Lexia Program is to enhance the English language 
communication and literacy skills for our English Language Learners. 
Teachers in Saturday Lexia Program will focus on improving student’s oral language, phonics, 
vocabulary, spelling and writing skills. Teachers will review student’s NYSESLAT subtest 
scores and students’ current reading levels and writing samples to determine the needs of the 
students. Students will also be evaluated through Lexia online diagnostic assessment tools, which 
will help to determine their most appropriate language comprehension and phonics skill 
development level. Teachers will plan or design small groups and skill targeted lessons as 
determined by the assessment data to address the individual needs and/or varying proficiency 
levels of the ELLs. 
In order to make learning more meaningful and comprehensible for our ELLs, teachers will also 
adopt blended teaching/learning models such as small group, differentiated instruction, student-
led conversation, discussion and/or independent work with teacher coaching and guiding,  Each 
lesson will be scaffolded, where appropriate, with  pictures, rebus, modeling, repetition, acting 
out, visualizing, relating to or building background knowledge, cloze reading, explicit 
vocabulary teaching in context, etc.  Home language support will also be provided to our ELLs 
since many teachers working in the program speak more than one language.  Peer support system 
such as partnership reading and writing will also be established to assist students in expanding 
their English reading and writing skills.  
After teacher-led small group instruction, students will work independently in on-line activities 
that are differentiated based on their individual needs where they will have an opportunity to 
apply and practice the strategies and skills learned in small group instruction. 
Students’ progress will be closely monitored through teacher-student conferencing, class work, 
teacher assessment and the Lexia on-line assessment system.

Materials used in Afterschool and Saturday Lexia Program 
●       Lexia Reading Core 5 
●       Lexia Direct/Differentiated Teaching Lessons 
●       Books in different genres 
 
Independent Reading session: 
Students are scheduled to read independently for half hour. During the independent reading, 
teachers will pull students for guided reading and individual conferencing, focusing on areas 
students need to improve and assess student understanding and engagement. Teachers will match 
students with just right books from the school’s library, model for them different reading 
strategies and encourage them to implement taught reading strategies to build stamina. 
  
Differentiated Math Program: 
  
Last year, our ENL students struggled with the state Math test. To address this, we will add a 
math component to our After School program. We will invite ENL students who scored level one 
and level two in Math to attend the After School Math Workshop. The goal of the math 
workshop is, in addition to helping students with the math content, to help them with content 
language and word problems. In order to achieve this goal, a team of teachers analyzed student 
math data and created math packets based on individual student needs. Math packets that will be 
used in the program are completely aligned to New York State Math Learning Standards and are 
specifically designed to cater to individual student’s needs. 
  
During the math workshop, our teachers will utilize ENL strategies to provide scaffolded 
instruction to our students. Content vocabulary will be taught through interactive math activities 
and resources. Students will be provided with the opportunity to engage with their peers as well 
as with the teacher. Language functions and structures will be incorporated in the context of the 
entire lesson.  
 
Assessment of student progress will be conducted throughout the workshop. Teachers will pull 
students individually or in small groups to provide targeted instruction based on their assessment. 
Results will also be shared with classroom teachers to afford the classroom teachers the 
opportunity to follow up with their students. 
 
ENL Instruction in the Saturday Program 
  
To facilitate student’s language acquisition and vocabulary development, the ENL teacher will 
scaffold each lesson by utilizing a wide variety of ENL strategies such as Total Physical 
Response, Language Experience Approach, Cooperative Learning,  Modeling, pantomiming, 
Interactive Writing, Shared Reading and Writing. Comprehensible input that will help to make 
the language and content more accessible to students such as  vocabulary cards with pictures, 
Read-Aloud pocket chart, Shared Reading chart, visuals, realia, manipulatives, music, 
dramatizing, oral language picture cards and digital resources, including Smart Boards, 
document camera, Read/Sing-along technology-based program, will be utilized in teaching to 
promote the development of student’s English vocabulary, Listening, Speaking, Reading and 
Writing skills. 
  
At the beginning of the program, the ENL teacher will review the student’s NYSITELL or 
student’s NYSESLAT performance in the modalities of Listening, Speaking, Reading and 
Writing and administer a diagnostic assessment to identify the individual needs of each ELL. 
Small group instruction will, hence, be designed to address the diverse needs of the students.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
Throughout the duration of the program, teachers will regularly assess the students’ needs and 
progress through a variety of effective assessment tools such as teacher-student conferencing, 
teacher observation, student’s class work and participation, benchmark text level assessments, 
etc. The ongoing assessment data will help teachers to make or tailor their Instructional decisions 
to target the changing needs of the students. 
  
To effectively monitor student’s growth in their English language learning, the teacher will 
establish a portfolio for each student to keep track of their performance. The portfolio will 
contain student’s class work, teacher-student conferencing notes, writing samples, benchmark 
text assessment levels, and other formative assessments.  The ENL teacher will use these 
assessment data to design or modify lessons for the students. 
  
The technology-based interactive program, Raz-Kids will also be used as needed by students 
who might need additional support or reinforcement in practicing what they have learned in 
small group instruction.  The program is not a standalone program. It will be used as a platform 
for students to practice what they have learned during the mini lesson. Teacher, on a regular 
basis, will stop students and, based on his/her assessment of the student, provide additional 
activities/resources. 
  
In order to foster their language development in a non-threatening environment, home language 
support will be available for all ELLs, especially the newcomer ELLs, in our supplementary 
program.  Instruction in content and language will be supported with home language, where 
appropriate, to make learning more accessible for students. Furthermore, Newcomer ELLs will 
be supported in a buddy system or partnership with students who speak the same home language. 
Instructional materials have been carefully selected to reflect student’s diverse cultural 
backgrounds. School library also contains books of various cultures in different languages such 
as Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Bengali, Urdu, Arabic, etc. Students will be provided with the 
opportunity to borrow books from the library. 
 
Records for both programs will be maintained on our data portal. Teachers will utilize the data 
portal to gather student level assessment data to differentiate support and cater to the needs of the 
students in the program as well as enter new assessment data based on their findings and 
interactions with students. Attendance will be taken daily using our attendance App (Kinvolved) 
and shared with the parents and classroom teachers. Our attendance App, sends text messages to 
parents in their preferred language as soon as the teacher takes attendance. 
Materials used in both programs are supplemental. For example, Lexia is used to enhance 
students' language acquisition and development. Math packets are created based on student level 
data gathered from the state math assessments. 
 
Students will be grouped heterogeneously for the most part. Teachers might pull small groups of 
students based on their common needs to provide targeted support when needed. Each teacher 
will not service more than fifteen (15) students at a given session. Students will be serviced by a 
licensed ESL teacher along with content area teacher.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Begin description here:            
P.S. 201 values the communication with parents and families of all students. Parent’s strong 
support and active involvement in their child’s education plays a vital role in the child’s success 
both in and outside school. Teachers at our school keep close contact with parents through a 
variety of communication channels such as school website, emails, letters/notes, phone calls 
and/or teacher-parent conferences. Parents are notified regularly about meetings and educational 
workshops via home letters, monthly calendars, telephone calls, school phone messenger, 
community bulletin boards, signs and flyers. All written communication is provided in English, 
and translated in the covered languages of the community including Spanish, Chinese, etc. 
Furthermore, a translation team has been established to help provide parents with the utmost 
support and assistance. Interpreters are available for all workshops and meetings conducted at 
school. 
 
The school’s Parent Coordinator, Pei-Hsia Wang, is proficient in English and Chinese. To further 
support student progress, every month our Parent Coordinator, with the support of the Staff 
Developers, will conduct workshops for parents on Literacy and Mathematics skills. Workshops 
on different topics such as Go Math, reading strategies, nutrition, diabetes, cancer awareness, 
immigration, New York City School Account, school attendance, safety, etc. will also be offered 
to parents.  The workshops will be held in the morning from 8:30 -9:30. Agendas and attendance 
records will be kept in the 2018-19 Title III After School/Saturday School folder. 
 
In addition, ENL teacher will conduct various parents’ workshops throughout the school year in 
literacy addressing such topics as familiarizing parents with the school system, the ENL/ELA 
standards and assessments for ELLs, and strategies that parents can use to help children at home. 
Furthermore, the ENL teacher will meet with parents individually to discuss their child’s 
language acquisition and academic progress and needs every Tuesday afternoon during Parent 
Outreach time. Teacher(s) who work in the supplementary after-school and Saturday programs 
will also meet with parents during Parent Outreach time on Tuesday afternoon to discuss their 
child’s progress in the program. 
  
Our parents will remain actively involved in the school’s decision-making process. The Title I 
Parent Involvement Committee regularly meets to develop and evaluate Title I services; parents 
are also members of the School Leadership Team and participate in scheduled meetings; they 
provide input on the selection of curriculum, instructional materials for students, and assist in 
aligning the budget. The parent attendance rate at our monthly Parents’ Association meetings is 
extremely high.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
PS201 uses ReadyGen Performance Based Assessments as well as a baseline writing assessment to assess early literacy skills of 
ELLs across the grades. Kindergarten teachers also use Shared Reading Protocol approach as an assessment tool. Data from 
kindergarten reveals a large disparity in English language proficiency within the grade where, in some cases,  letter and sound 
recognition skills are on par with those of native speakers and in other cases there are notable deficiencies. Across the grades, 
data reveals student struggles in the areas of academic vocabulary as well as sentence structure in writing. This data informs 
the creation of strategic groups to address specific student needs.aste response to questions here:    
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

ENL team meet periodically to monitor language acquisition growth. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of programs for ELLs is determined by student performance in Fountas & Pinnell reading assessments and 
ReadyGen Performance Based assessments  (assessed via rubric) throughout the year as well as student performance in ELL 
Periodic Assessments, NYSESLAT and state assessments in ELA, Math and Science (Grade 4 only). 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  
The ENL team meets periodically to analyze student progress and properly evaluate impact of interventions. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Using NYSESLAT reports,  such as the modality reports, teacher observations and student work we are able to guage and target 
specific areas of need in order for RTI personnel to be able to focus on concentrated areas of need.  RTI strategies and tools 
are used not only with the ENL teacher but continuously within the students daily class schedules across the content areas in 
order to promote and help the ELL's within the curricula. The school uses the different assessments to better target RTI 
strategies and to be able to assess which strategies are working best for the students.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Analysis of data over the past three years reveals that students across the grades have performed significantly better on the 
speaking component of the NYSESLAT than on other components. The writing component has consistently presented as the 
area of greatest challenge where students have difficulty translating their thoughts into writingPaste response to question 
here:    
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The ENL team meets periodically to analyze student progress and make the appropriate adjustments to curriculum, delivery of 
instruction and assessments. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The program used to deliver ENL is the Freestanding model. Delivery of instruction in the push-in model is in English. 
ReadyGen and Go Math have built-in ENL components that provide the necessary strategies for ENL students. Parallel 
teaching provides better targeted instruction for students and teachers in which they can utilize multiple entry points 
for lessons. The Freestanding ENL program is mostly push in and in English. Students are pulled out when necessary 
and are grouped no more than 2 grades apart. Using multiple entry points allows for more successful comprehension 
for complex texts across the content areas. Strategies used include but are not limited to, scaffolding for texts that 
need to be broken down and better explained, teaching various strategies through informational texts, close reading 
which provides student opportunities to go back and reread texts for accuracy, fluency, comprehension which builds 
stamina, recognizing and analyzing various nuances within different types of texts and facilitating and encouraging 
students to hold class discussions based on evidence and facts presented within the text. Students are also shown to 
recognize word relationships, including blends, diagraphs, chunking, grammar , syntax and tenses.   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

              The staffing of one ENL teacher who is assigned the full complement of ENL's provides the mandated number of 
minutes for the ESL population. Entering and emerging ENL's receive 360 minutes of instruction. The push-in model of 
instruction facilitates the delivery of mandated minutes as the ENL teacher works with small groups of grade-level peers within 
any given instructional period. As instruction in ENL is , for the most part, provided within the context of the students' 
classroom, the ENL teacher can compliment the work of the classroom teacher through the provision of key ENL strategies. 
When instruction is provided in a pull-out model, the ENL teacher meets with classroom teachers during grade-level planning 
sessions to make sure her work is aligned with that of the classroom teacher and there is continuity of instruction for all 
students. Transitioning and expanding students receive 180 minutes of instruction and commanding 90 minutes.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
      Content area instruction is delivered in English through non-fiction reading and artifact exploration. Books written in 
languages other than English as well as those that represent the cultural backgrounds of ELLs are made available to students 
both within their classrooms libraries and in our school based Robin Hood Library. Foreign language dictionaries are also 
available. Access to the content areas is supported through the use of visuals as well as the incorporation of hands-on learning 
experiences. Language development is further supported through the utilization of Shades of Meaning cards. These color-
coded index cards indicate words of increasing complexity (for example, happy, delighted, elated might be utilized to 
demonstrate more sophisticated alternatives to happy). Additionally, conversation prompts posted in classrooms encourage 
active participation by ELLs during questioning and discussion. Students are also taught to use summary frames to aid the 
acquisition of domain-specific content. The specific needs of ELLs are addressed in instructional planning both within and 
across grades. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

      ENL's are evaluated in their native language when the ENL teacher recognizes the need based on data garnered from 
assessments administered within instruction. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Differentiated instruction takes place throughout the school day. Each student develops individual learning goals in 
conjunction with his/her classroom teacher and with support from the ENL teacher. These goals help students set targets for 
their learning and are utilized when they meet with their teachers during small group work and conferences. Goals are 
updated approximately every six weeks. Key skills assessed within the context of the NYSESLAT are taught explicitly and 
reviewed on a regular basis. Students are also familiarized with the structure of the NYSESLAT. Long-term ELLs are provided 
with additional support in navigating complex texts (via the use of visuals and close reading strategies) during their time with 
the ENL teacher. Although there are no SIFE 
ELLs in the building at present, should students defined as SIFE enroll in the future PS201 faculty would utilize resources 
made  available  through the Office of English Language Learners such as the video,  SIFE: Meeting the Challenge, to support 
instructional planning.  Technology would be utilized extensively to increase exposure to English with visual and auditory 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

supports and SIFE ELLs  would be included in intensive reading programs such as Leveled Literacy Intervention. 
A. SIFE - students prior knowledge would be assessed in the content areas and outcomes of the assessment would be used to 
create scaffolds across content areas within lessons, additionally providing visual supports such as charts, graphs, picture word 
cards with descriptions prompts and etc… Teachers along with the ENL teacher would provide supplemental materials 
available for the content areas.  
B. Newcomer - students would receive differentaited instruction by implementing visuals, extra support, picture word cards, 
graphic organizers, repetition strategies, small group instruction, translation when needed, various scaffolds and peer help. 
C. Developing - After reviewing NYSESLAT, the ENL teacher along with the teachers would work on targeted modalities by 
using graphic organizers, scaffolds. small group, RTI , various reading, writing, math and reading strategies to help develop 
these areas in need so the students abilities and skills will be successful at testing proficient on the NYSESLAT.  
D. Long Term - long term Ell's are provided with additional support in navigating thru various texts across the content areas 
and are taught various strategies which allows them multiple entry points in order to achieve their goals. They also use various 
graphic organizers and lessons and scaffolds if necessary. Most of our long term ELL's are SWD and test well in all modalities 
except for writing which holds them back. These areas are targeted and worked on with the ENL teacher along with the 
students' teachers inorder for the ELL's to become strong enough and progress enough to eventually test proficient in the 
NYSESLAT. 
E. Former ELL's - are provided extra support who work alongside the classroom teacher to target the areas of weakness the 
students have. Teachers will use visuals, scaffolds, and graphic organizers when necessary for extra support. ELL's will receive 
additional 90 min. support as per CRPart 154 for the next 2 years.  Former ELL's will also continue to get testing accomodations 
for the following 2 years after testing Commanding from NYSESLAT.  
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
The instructional strategies used by teachers include, but are not limited to, picture support, academic vocabulary, graphic 
organizers, scaffolds across all content areas when needed. Additionally , front loading vocabulary with picture support, 
deconstructing and reconstructing complex sentences and texts within all content areas. Students also receive RTI, push in and 
pull out supports that focus on areas in need around English language acquisition. Students are shown a variety of strategies 
for multiple entry points for better comprehension. All SWD receive their services based on their IEP and ENL mandates.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
ELL-SWDs receive additional support when they are working with the ENL teacher in a pullout context. They are grouped with 
grade-level peers and similar levels of proficiency. Students are also pulled in small group instruction and are integrated 
amongst their peers who have similar levels of proficiency in the modalities. Students are placed in ICT classes based on their 
IEP recommendations, parent and Special Education team.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Targeted intervention services for ELLs are designed with the Common Core Learning Standards in mind. Determining 
Language Functions and Structures tackles the use of language for specific purposes. Data garnered from assessments provides 
insight into the language functions that work best for individual ELLs and intervention is offered within flexible instructional 
groups. ELLs also particpate in Leveled Literacy Intervention as well as AIS groups in literacy and math as needed. Students are 
also grouped with no more than 10 students for small group instruction for all content areas if needed, and teachers along 
with ENL teachers target instruction using formalized progams along with supplemental materials, graphic organizers, 
scaffolds, picture support, front loading vocabulary and etc as needed. Assessing, monitoring and recording student 
achievement and data ae all used to set goals and work on mext steps for ELL's in ELA, Math and other content areas.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

We have considered a phonics/grammar morning program based on NYSESLAT and NYSITELL levels. These groups will be small 
group of no more than 15 and target grade and level specific vocabulary, grammar and phonics practices. An after school 
program based on small group instruction will target theme based lessons to provide additional support  for NYSESLAT and 
other assessments that ELL's will need to take. The push in model with increased focus on tiered idiomatic expressions and 
nuances that are embedded in content texts.    
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs through the distribution of flyers and other information. Our Parent 
Coordinator acts as a liaison in providing translation services to Asian parents that make them aware of programs being 
offered. Our Pupil Accounting Secretary provides assistance in translation to Spanish-speaking families. Families who speak 
languages other than Mandarin and Spanish receive information about programs from other staff members who speak their 
native language. Among the curricular programs offered to ELLs are Music and Movement, Chinese language instruction via 
Chinese Advantage Academy, Tae Kwon Do, Ballroom Dancing and Test Prep. Before each program begins, a letter of 
explanation and application is distributed to families. Once students are selected, families are invited to an orientation where 
translation services are made available to non English-speaking parents. ELLs are included in all current programs offered, both 
during and after the school day. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Technology is utilized as an instructional tool throughout the day. Through our Go Math program, all students have online 
access to a myriad of resources and teachers are enabled to assign individualized tasks within Think-Central. "Colorin 
Colorado" and other websites are also utilized within instruction and made available to families via the PS201 porta-portal 
(www.ps201.org) In addition, NYSESLAT workbooks are used to prepare students for the upcoming NYSESLAT. Additionally 
graphic organizers, Wordly Wise and other vocabulary with picture supports are used. Our GoMath prgram which is CCLS 
aligned has online extensions and resources for students. My Talking Dictionary which is an interactive software designed to 
reinforce the students native language as well as English.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Books written in languages other than English as well as those that represent the cultural backgrounds of ELLs are made 
available to students both within their classroom libraries and in our school based Robin Hood Library. Foreign language 
dictionaries are also available. Many of the read-alouds shared with students across the day include phrases from other 
languages, thus acknowledging the importance of languages other than English. Beginner ELLs are further supported through 
the creation of personalized dictionaries that include words written both in English and in their native language often 
accompanied by a visual support.Second grade students also receive direct instruction in Mandarin through our partnership 
with Chinese Advantage Academy.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Services and supports are delivered as per NCLB and CR Part 154 at the ELLs' ages and grade levels. Differentiated instruction is 
provided based on need as determined by student performance on assessments. Based upon the curriculum, age appropriate 
resources are distributed to teachers that ensure all ELL students including SWD receive appropriate supports, which increases 
their proficiency levels and abilities, targeting all 4 modalities.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Technology is utilized as an instructional tool throughout the day. Through our Go Math program, all students have online 
access to a myriad of resources and teachers are enabled to assign individualized tasks within ThinkCentral. Colorin Colorado 
and other websites are also utilized within instruction and made available to families via the PS201 porta-portal 
(www.ps201.org) In addition, NYSESLAT workbooks are used to prepare students for the upcoming NYSESLAT. Additionally

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
There are no activities to assist newly enrolled ELL students prior to the beginning of the school year. Our Parent 
Coordinator  works diligently to outreach to new families of ELLs and helps them assimilate into the school environment. She 
hosts workshops to address specific needs and includes these families in professional development opportunities outside the 
school context. The principal conducts monthly Open Forum with the Principal meetings to update parents on school 
happenings and to allow opportunity for parental input. She is assisted by our Parent Coordinator in these outreach efforts.

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Professional Development is provided by a yearlong series of workshops offered by the district. Furthermore, the ENL teacher 
offers individualized support for teachers who work directly with ELLs and turnkeys information garnered from meetings 
and workshops. A specific focus of this work is deconstructing tasks so that ELLs have access to the rigorous curriculum offered 
across the school day. The ENL teacher models how to select high leverage vocabulary and content-specific vocabulary and 
phrases and how to front-load ELLs in preparation for instruction.    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 In preparing students for middle school, fifth graders are taken on a tour of several  
local middle schools and are provided with opportunity to meet with ENL teachers and curriculum support staff at those 
locations. This is central to our work in fostering a college-bound mindset among our seniors.   Each staff member receives 
their allotted professional development. This work takes place during monthly Grade conferences, PL sessions with our lower 
and upper grade Peer Collaborative Teachers , and at strategically chosen professional development opportunities offered by 
the district. ELL training also takes place on mandated Staff Development days as per the DOE school calendar. Attendance at 
ELL training is tracked via attendance sheets completed at each professional development workshop.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
 As a direct result of our Chancellor's focus on strong family and community ties, each teacher is provided with the opportunity 
to meet with students' parents on any Tuesday afternoon. In PS201, teachers conduct parent meetings and field phone calls to 
parents 2:30p.m. -3:45p.m.  each Tuesday. Many classroom teachers also utilize Class D.O.J.O to keep parents abreast of 
classroom happenings throughout the school day. Parents are also informed of all activities at our school via our monthly 
school calendar, School Messenger Service and our E-envelope that can be accessed on our school website.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

  The Parent Coordinator hosts monthly workshops to address parental needs and curriculum-focused workshops are 
facilitated by Administration as well as our Peer Collaborative Teachers. Parents of ELLs participate in Title III workshops. 
Parents are also invited to attend Parent Read-Alouds, chaperoned class trips, offer in-class, multi-cultural presentations  and 
celebrate student success at Awards Assemblies.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Rebecca Lozada, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

P.S. 201Q uses the following sources to identify parent language preferences: Home Language Identification 
Surveys, Principal Open Forums, PTA meetings, Parent Workshops & Surveys, as well as Family Nights. We also 
have a school form that invites parents to select their preferred language. This form provides vital information as 
we prepare for Family/Community events and, in particular, Parent-Teacher Conferences. During Parent-Teacher 
Conferences we capitalize on the existing language strengths of faculty. Our bilingual and multilingual faculty 
members are a vital asset to our school, students, family and community members, not only during events but 
throughout the year. Such faculty members are our ENL teacher who is fluent in Greek and Spanish, our Guidance 
Counselor who speaks Creole, our Dean of Students alongside other faculty who are fluent in Spanish as well, our 
Physical Education teachers and other faculty who speak Mandarin and Cantonese, and finally our principal who is 
fluent in Turkish, German and Arabic. We also have many of staff members who speak Greek, Spanish and Italian. 
With this wonderful array of languages and cultured staff, P.S. 201 is able to outreach to students, parents, 
families and all other stakeholders in various ways and always promotes an open door policy of communication. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70 

 

We also use various communication sites and applications when needed such as but not limited to, Google 
Translate and the DOE Translation Unit, as needed.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

P.S. 201Q will utilize the services of School Messenger as well as the Remind app and Kinvolve which affords a variety 
of languages in order to communicate with limited-English-proficient families in the event of an emergency. We will 
also have our multilingual staff members use the information on the emergency cards and Class Dojo in order to 
exhaust all methods of communication to the parents and family members when needed. Voice and text messages 
will be provided in English, Spanish & Chinese predominantly, and any other languages when needed.  

  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 will be disseminated to all staff members in September 2018 and, moving forward, will 
be integrated into our Employee Handbook. In terms of resources, P.S. 201Q has several staff members who are 
fluent in our families’ preferred languages and who assist in providing translation services, both across the school day 
and during Parent-Teacher Conferences and evening events. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Limited-English Proficient parents are identified during the student intake process at which time either our Pupil 
Accounting Secretary, ENL teacher, or licensed pedagogue alongside with our Parent Coordinator makes them aware 
of their rights. These parents are offered translation services on invites to Parent-Teacher Conferences and school 
personnel is on hand to provide these services during PTA meetings and Family Nights, such as STEAM Family Nights & 
our annual Lunar New Year celebration. Further, translation into Spanish & Chinese predominantly, but other 
languages are available as well, are provided on important notices sent out to families throughout the school year.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services

Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

P.S. 201Q consistently encourages parents to provide feedback via our texting feature "Remind App", school website 
PS201.org, Twitter account and school Facebook. We also conduct surveys to ensure all our families have an 
opportunity to provide feedback. Our families also know that our ENL teacher has an open door policy and may 
contact her at any time for assistance providing feedback or with any other matters throughout the school year. This 
feedback is discussed at meetings between Administration and our LAC and issues are resolved accordingly.
