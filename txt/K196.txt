Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

We believe all of our students will have the opportunity to reach their fullest potential. Our school community will 
ensure that our students will be college and career ready. Our mission is being committed to working towards the 
enhancement of our standards driven instructional program, creating high levels of academic excellence for all of our 
students in each of the disciplines. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

PS 196 is located in the community of East Williamsburg, Brooklyn. In 20116 we became the Williamasburg Bridge 
Magnet School for Communication and Mixed Media Arts. Our school serves Pre-Kindergarten through grade five. 
13% of our students are ELL (English Language Learners), and 29% are SWD (Students with Disabilities). Our student 
population is 79 % Hispanic, 17% Black, 2% White, and 1% Asian.  

Through creative and comprehensive strategies of instruction, our students will become lifelong learners. 

We set our students up for success at PS 196. The tasks that teachers give to students are challenging and motivating, 
students are always involved in discussions with their classmates and teachers ask open ended questions, listen, then 
provide feedback. We will work hard to ensure that our students be afforded the opportunity to participate in all 
college and career ready activities through teachers collaborating, teachers preparing engaging and high quality 
lessons and activities, promoting students' critical thinking skills, teaching them goal setting, encouraging teamwork 
and listening and speaking skills as well as allowing time for reflection. 

With the implementation of The Leader in Me, students will be empowered to be leaders by using universal principles 
which are 7 habits and develop a new mindset in our school. 

We have several strengths at our school, but our biggest strength is the ability to forge relationships. We are a UFT 
Community Learning School with a full time Community School Director , a UFT PROSE (Progressive Redesign School 
of Excellence) school.  

We also have a Dual Language Spanish Program this school year and have expanded to grades K,1,2, 3 and 4. Our 
students use The Estrellita Program and Harcourt Senderos. 

Our OST (Out of School Time) Program is overseen by Grand Street Settlement. It runs everyday after school, 
Summers and holidays. 

Our school was fortunate enough to be the recipients of Council member Antonio Reynoso's Participatory Budget for 
$300,000. We now have a state of the art Community Media Technology Lab. PS 196 also has a Block Room that was 
donated by a private organization that is utilized by all of our students.  

As of October 1, 2017, PS 196 received a MSAP grant. We are now The Williamsburg Bridge Magnet School for 
Communication and Mixed Media Arts. 

We have a dental clinic sponsored by NYU Langone .  

This year we will open our Black Box Theater space, which will be home to plays and other musical performances.  

 

We currently have partnerships with the following organizations: 

* Aeropostale Block Room

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We will continue to provide a safe environment that empowers all children, including English Language Learners and 
students with special needs, to experience greater success and confidence in themselves, allowing them to grow 
socially, emotionally, as well as academically into well rounded productive citizens. Our students will attain these 
goals through the collaboration of school, home and community. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our Framework for Great Schools report for 2017 indicated that we scored highest in Trust with a score of 4.69, 
Collaborative Teachers 4.62, Effective School Leadership 4.59, Strong Family and Community Ties 4.08, and Rigorous 
Instruction 3.97. 

For the indicator of Effective School Leadership we showed growth of 5% and in Strong Family Community Ties we 
had a 7% increase. We maintained 98% in Trust.  

Trust continues to be our strength at PS 196. The sub-indicator of Teacher-Principal trust was 100% 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

According to our data, our 2018 NYS ELA scores have increased by 15% in Math our scores increased by 6%. 
Consequently, our instructional focus will be to increase our Rigorous Instruction by increasing student vocabulary, 
stamina, critical thinking skills, and student discussions. This year we will introduce Project Based Learning to all of our 
students, using the Harcourt Journeys Balanced-Literacy Comprehensive Program. and the Harcourt Go Math 
Program. We also also have a Math Focus using the problem of the day that will be introduced across the school.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
According to our 2018 data, all students scoring levels 3's and 4's in grades 3, 4 and 5, showed a increase in NYS ELA 
scores by 15%. In Math, we showed an increase of 6%. 

Also our most recent Quality Review in the indicator of pedagogy 1.2 states, "teaching practices reflect an articulated 
set of beliefs that all students at all levels are engaged in appropriately challenging tasks and demonstrate higher-
order thinking, however high quality extensions were not observed."  

On The Framework for Great Schools Report for 2017-18, in the element of Rigorous Instruction, we scored 64% on 
the quality of student discussion. 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, student performance in grades 3,4, and 5, will increase 2% on the NYS ELA Assessment.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 196, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS 196 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

  host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise 

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right

to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 
and other applicable sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
 Our Title III Language Instruction program has been designed to supplement our 
regular school ESL program, by providing an innovative, high quality program and materials that 
can 
further engage and assist our ELL students with reading, writing and math to help them further 
develop academic English language. P.S. 196 offers its ESL students a 3D 
Printing/STEAM  program which combines science, engineering, art and mathematics 
disciplines with reading and writing. Each lesson is linked directly 
to New York State Standards and Objectives. P.S. 196 ESL students are afforded the 
benefit of a hands on program where they use state-of-the-art 3D printing technology to put in 
practice concepts and skills learned in their regular literacy and mathematics curriculum to create 
objects of interest to them. 
Through the use of guided lessons that employ a variety of ESL techniques, as well as visual and 
other supports, students are taught the necessary skills to complete a variety of projects that bear 
direct relevance and interest to their lives. Lessons also all contain writing instruction and 
student exercises and practice, since each 3D printing project contains a writing component. 
Students are given appropriate assistance and scaffolded supports to allow them to complete this 
component. Projects such as "Basic Circuitry", or "Types of Bridges", as well as ones open to a 
broader range of creativity, such as "My Robot", all allow students to express themselves largely 
through this exciting, new medium, while concurrently expressing themselves, exploring science 
and engineering and further developing their writing literacy skills. Completed projects are 
included in the school's Spring Arts Festival. Students engage building circuits to create a night 
light, creating key chains with words on them, building a bridge model and a simple toy 
robot.  They learn to use Tinkercad software and Makerbot to design, edit, alter and print their 
objects, then, completing a written piece in either their home language or English that is relevant 
to the project and that will accompany it, and completing final decorative elements for their 
projects. 
All records, including student attendance and program notification in parents' preferred 
languages, invitations to join us on field trips or to attend the Spring Festival, are maintained in a 
file containing copies of letters sent or signed letters sent back to the school. This is maintained 
in the Main Office. 
Materials used in this program are supplemental and distinct from those used for daily class 
instruction.  
We  purchased a 3D printer and related software and texts that support this program. 
There is detailed and extensive data and research that support the use of STEAM Programs in 
our schools.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
Our program takes place after school on Tuesdays and Thursdays, for two hours each session, 
from 3pm-5pm, as well as twice per month on Saturday, from 9am-11am, for two hours each 
session, from October 17th until June 14. The program runs for a total of 68 after school sessions 
and 18 Saturday sessions.The number of ESL students participating in the LTP program is 
currently 15. The grade levels of these students are grades 3, 4 and 5. Students are divided into 
two groups for both the after-school program and the Saturday sessions. Third graders are in one 
group and fourth and fifth graders comprise the second group. The ESL teacher rotates to the 
groups to service them. Seven are third grade students, four are fourth grade students, and five 
are fifth grade students. The language used for instruction 
is English. Materials to assist students in Spanish are available online. Additionally, bilingual 
project directions and other home language supportive materials are sent home with each 
student.The program runs from October through June and is taught by Ms. Calo, our licensed 
ESL 
teacher and is supervised by the school principal, Mrs. Colon. This will be at no cost to the 
program since she is on-site for other after school programs that take place at the same time.

Begin description here:            
 Our school engages in a comprehensive process that affords all staff  
appropriate and compelling opportunities for Professional Development. Information with 
respect to  
the many and varied instructional and informational seminars - whether offered through the 
Division of  
English Language Learners and Student Support (DELLSS), BETAC, the New York State 
Department of Education or our Brooklyn North Borough Field Support Center - 
are disseminated to all staff, including teachers, administrators, school psychologist, social 
worker and others, whose knowledge of and interaction with English Language Learners can 
make a positive  
difference in their education and their lives. In addition, we hold regular meetings where the 
ESL  
provider and classroom teachers discuss new research trends with a focus on innovative and 
insightful  
approaches and solutions that might be engaged by us with respect to the specific needs of our 
English  
Language Learners. In the past school year, our ESL provider attended numerous workshops 
offered by District 14. She turn-keyed her knowledge to classroom teachers to assist them in 
effective data based  
instruction for their ELL students. Tentative dates and topics for our in-house seminars are the 
following: 
-Understanding the needs of LEP and immigrant student learners (September 2018) 
-Harcourt ELL student handbook-decoding phonics and spelling (October 2018) 
-Harcourt scaffolded learning (November 2018)

-Rosetta Stone- Reading and Writing for second language learners (January 2019) 
-Writing and the visual experience (February 2019) 
-Rosetta Stone-effective use with the ELL student (March 2019) 
-Using STEAM activities as a path to writing (April 2019) 
-The role of data in guiding instruction for ELLs (May 2019) 
-Preparing immigrant students and ELLs for summer learning (June 2019) 
This component will be at no cost to the program. Professional Development sessions will be 
provided 
by Pearson, Rosetta Stone and our ESL teacher, Ms Calo.  
Each session runs approximately two hours. Records, including agendas, attendance sheets, 
informational handouts, and so forth, are maintained in files in the ENL teacher's classroom. 
Professional development sessions are designed to positively impact the progress of our ELL 
students, by providing their teachers with additional information, tools and strategies that they 
can employ in their instruction, that specifically addresses and supports their ELL's literacy 
development. 
The ENL teacher will be providing the PD for a small number of these sessions and thus will be 
in attendance at all others. In addition, as previously noted, our ENL teacher attends a variety of 
PD sessions offered in various forums throughout the school year and turnkeys what she has 
learned for her colleagues. 
  

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities

The first parent orientation day, where parents are given information 
regarding their rights, available programs and other issues of relevance to bilingual and ESL 
education, 
and where they are encouraged to express their concerns and ask any questions they wish to is 
scheduled at P.S. 196 on September 4, 2018. Additionally, our 
parent coordinator and our ESL teacher have a close, mutually supportive working relationship 
which 
benefits both parents and students. This facilitates information being transmitted to parents 
quickly, 
and any concerns they have, being dealt with promptly. 
Our parents are invited to collaborate with their children through school funded trips to various 
neighborhoods and cultural institutions. In the past, we have 
offered our students and their parents a trip to Chinatown, where they were asked to document 
the life 
of the community, treated to lunch at a local restaurant, and then asked to write about their

experiences and reflections on an unfamiliar culture. Additionally, during our Spring Arts 
Festival, where 3D Printing/STEAM projects are exhibited,  parents and the community are 
invited to celebrate the various clubs talents and 
works.  This gives ELL students, especially, the much needed opportunity to shine. We also offer 
ELL  
parent workshops to support parental efforts to assist and engage with their children's 
education. These are provided by our ENL teacher and our parent coordinator, both of whom are 
bilingual as well as by guest providers. Our tentative topics and schedule for this school year are 
as follows: 
-Supporting first language literacy as a bridge to English (October 2018) 
-Helping your child with reading (December 2018) 
-Practicing writing in English (February 2019) 
Math and English (April 2019) 
-Parent and child summer reading and writing projects (June 2019). 
  
Since virtually all of our parents speak either Spanish or English, or both, translation assistance 
will be provided by Ms. Calo, the ESL teacher, and Mrs. Maria Rodriguez, our Parent 
Coordinator. 
Each session will run for approximately two hours. Records for agendas, attendance sheets, 
invitations in parents' preferred language, as well as informational handouts, are maintained in a 
file in the ENL provider's classroom.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
We use a variety of assessment tools to assess the early literacy skills of our ELL's including Fountas and Pinnell and running 
records. This data provides us with insights relevant to how much literacy a student has achieved.  This information is then 
used to target areas of deficiency for that student. Next steps are planned based on the data yielded from these assessment 
tools. Areas  of weakness  are addressed through targeted strategy  lessons based on the data, as well as through the use of 
technology and learning centers. After reviewing the results of the Fountas and Pinnell, it was determined that targeted and 
focused early literacy instruction would be valuable, and thus, we instituted Harcourt Journeys. These tools have 
proven effective  for providing focus and direction when formulating curriculum's and modifying classroom instruction. For 
example, a comparison of students'  NYSESLAT reading and writing sub scores with their performance on the ELA reading and 
writing segments is used to target instruction based on the student needs thus revealed. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

The structures that we have in place is that we use the results from Fountas and Pinnell and running records to determine 
where are students are at and what their needs are. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We evaluate the success of our Program for ELL's in a variety of ways. We do ongoing assessment and monitoring of content 
area understanding and progress in the classroom. Additionally, a valuable indicator of the success of our program is to 
analyze how long it takes for our ELL's to transition out of ENL and into fully monolingual English settings.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The structures that we have in place is that if student's are not making progress we will change the interventions that we are 
using. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
We use data to guide our instruction within the RTI framework. We match our instruction and interventions to student needs 
based on the data and have continuous monitoring of progress. Our intervention plans are designed, implemented and 
monitored by our multidisciplinary school-based team. We use assessments that include the Curriculum Based Tool to identify 
levels of proficiency for each student. The results allow us to review both group and individual performance on specific skills 
and inform our instructional planning decisions. We use the three tier RTI intervention model of universal interventions, 
targeted interventions, and intensive interventions as part of this process. Based on the use of assessments such as Harcourt 
Journeys, Vocabulary, Spelling, Writing, and other teacher designed assessments and the data yielded from them, we make 
instructional and programming decisions to better serve the academic needs of our ENL students. These data inform our 
decision-making regarding whether moving to a Tier 2 or a Tier 3 RTI intervention for an individual student is potentially 
valuable. As a result, it provides insight that allows us to determine if additional attention and activities or experiences are 
likely to benefit them, or if perhaps targeted intensive individualized instruction is what is likely to prove successful. 
 
 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Data patterns across all of our grades, K - 5, are as follows: Across proficiency levels, results show that most students taking 
the NYSITELL fall into the Entering level of proficiency. The data reveals that regardless of proficiency level our ELL students 
have the most difficulty passing the NYSESLAT. This would seem to be an area that is ripe for further investigation.  98% of 
entering ENL students are unable to answer any questions in English on the NYSITELL. The other 2% are able to answer very 
few questions in English. Thus all are coded EN as they are new arrivals to the country and are at the beginning (Entering) level 
for learning English. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The structures that we have in place is to evaluate the programs and services that we are providing our ELL students to see 
what's working and what's not. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Our freestanding ENL program groups students by both proficiency level as well as grade level to the maximum extent 
possible.Standalone ENL instruction is delivered using the pull-out model and is provided by our ENL instructor in his 
classroom. Integrated ENL instruction is provided using the push-in model with co-teaching done by both the 
ENL teacher and the content area teacher. A variety of pedagogical approaches, including project-based learning and 
appropriate scaffolds are used to make material comprehensible for students. Resources include English language 
workbooks, bilingual and native language story books, bilingual dictionaries and glossaries, realia, electronic 
translators, and language software programs among others. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

n/a 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Our Dual Language Kindergarten, First Grade, & Second Grade programs contain mixed proficiency levels. It is taught 
by a fully bilingual Spanish/English pedagogue, with half the instructional time with lessons taught in English, and half 
the instructional time lessons taught in the target language, Spanish. Our ENL program employs both the push-in and 
pull-out models. Students are grouped by proficiency level, to the extent practicable. Both integrated and standalone 
ENL components are taught as per Part CR 154.2.  

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

a. The ENL schedule reflects the appropriate number of instructional minutes each student receives as per mandates for  each 
of the five proficiency levels. Beginning/Entering and Low Intermediate/Emerging students receive 360 minutes of ENL 
instruction, 180 of which are standalone and 180 integrated ENL/ELA instruction. Intermediate/Transitioning students receive 
180 minutes of ENL, 90 of which are integrated. Advanced/Expanding students receive 180 minutes of instruction, all of which 
is integrated ENL/ELA instruction, or content area instruction, while Proficient/Commanding students receive 90 minutes of 
ENL instruction.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
The language of instruction is English. We put appropriate scaffolds in place to make content comprehensible to ELL's and we 
differentiate instruction to both enhance comprehensibility and to enrich language development. We use a variety of ENL 
strategies and methodologies, including TPR, the Natural Approach, and a variety of other instructional approaches depending 
on the content being taught and the students that are learning it. We use graphic organizers, integrated technology, learning 
centers, small group instruction, one on one instruction, and native language peers to make content more comprehensible. 
We use the ENL component of the Harcourt Storytown series, Harcourt Journeys as well as the Heinle Picture Dictionary and 
workbook and writing journals, in tandem with a variety of technological software and adjuncts. Our ENL provider articulates 
with content area teachers in the specific area. We have aligned our lessons to the Common Core Learning Standards. Content 
area support is provided through the use of appropriate scaffolds as well as by articulation and co-teaching between the 
ENL and the content area teacher. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Our Dual Language Kindergarten, First Grade, & Second Grade teachers monitor home language development with ongoing 
assessments throughout the school year. We use the Estrellita assessments as well as school designed informal assessments. 
The Estrellita Word Study Program provides progress monitoring of individual students. Based on the results instruction is 
modified and targeted to meet areas in need of development.  The Spanish LAB is used as an initial indicator of native language 
proficiency.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. Our instructional plan for SIFE students includes intensive and focused instruction before, during and after school to address 
the specific needs of each student. Students are provided with Native Language Libraries and materials to enhance literacy 
skills in their home language. These skills will assist the development of English Language skills as well. Students are placed in 
small groups where the focus is on phonics and phonemic awareness, as well as basic literacy skills. In their class Balanced 
Literacy Guided Reading Strategies are employed, and as well these students receive small group instruction with AIS 
instructors using appropriate scaffolds and differentiated instruction. 
 
b. In addition to the above, newcomers are put into a Buddy Program where extra time is dedicated to making content and 
testing strategies understandable. 
 
c/d. In addition, we analyze the data from all of the tests these students receive and attempt to determine the limiting factor 
impeding passing the NYSESLAT, and we target these areas for intensive instruction. 
                e. Former ENL's are provided additional support in the classroom, and are provided small 
groups                                 instruction to prepare them for the standardized exams.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Our teachers of ENL and SWD students use a variety of instructional strategies and grade level materials in order to make 
academic content comprehensible and accessible. Theses include some of the following: We use differentiated instructional 
strategies as well as putting many scaffolds in place to help students achieve necessary academic goals. We employ a variety of 
instructional strategies including Tiered Questioning, CALLA, TPR and Natural Approach as well as others when appropriate. 
IEP's are reviewed to ensure that all mandated services are received. The ENL teacher articulates with the SBST and the school 
psychologist. Delivery of services is tracked through SESIS reports. We have specific small group targeted instruction that 
addresses different learning styles.  When appropriate, we use visual as well auditory and technological assists. Our grade level 
materials include Harcourt Journeys and Go Math, the Heinle Dictionary and Writing Workbooks, bilingual libraries and 
dictionaries, as well as pocket electronic translators. We use a variety of strategies to meet the diverse needs of our ELL and 
SWD students. We have targeted push-in as well as pullout small group instruction. Many of our AIS service providers use parts 
of Harcourt Journeys and Go Math in out of class focused groups to practice specific skills. Our units of study are aligned with 
the Common Core Standards. Thus, we attempt to focus on the Universal Design for Learning. When there is material that has 
not been adequately comprehended  and synthesized, as reflected by test data and teacher assessments, students are given 
extended day intensive instruction. Our school culture is a particularly collaborative one, thus, our teachers coordinate with 
respect to students receiving an additional period of instruction in an area of difficulty for that student, when the other 
teacher is teaching that material. Finally, we have one extra free period per week that we use to assign students to small group 
special needs instruction to address their specific areas of weakness for that week. In order to maximize time spent with non-
disabled peers, students are mainstreamed for the use of flexible scheduling, in gym, technology class and clubs. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
We use a variety of pedagogical methods to address the diverse learning styles of our ELL-SWDs. After reviewing their IEPs we 
determine how best to achieve the goals outlined by planning and collaborating with the Special Education teacher. As a result 
we are able to achieve flexibility in scheduling and determine the best instructional approach and materials to be used with an 
individual student within the least restrictive environment.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
All of our programs are taught in English. After reviewing the data  from the ELA exam and the NYSESLAT, we have found a 
need for intensive targeted early literacy focus. As a result, we have instituted a variety of targeted intervention programs. 
Some of the targeted intervention programs we offer are Harcourt Journeys, AIS, Small Group instruction, and Pull-Out ELL 
Inquiry Team Small Group Instruction. SIFE students, newcomers, and long term ELL's are assigned to the program that best 
addresses their needs. Additionally, we use Fundations, Great Leaps, guided reading, and technology supports, all within the 
context of focused small group in and out of classroom instruction. In Math, 6.8% of ELL students are in the bottom range, 
21.3% are approaching their target goal, and 33.5% are meeting their target. In ELA, 11.7% are in the bottom range, 24% are 
appraoching their target, 34.3% are meeting their target, and 44.4% are exceeding their target. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We will be expanding our Rosetta Stone Program and using additional ENL software as part of the targeted intervention 
program described above.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We plan to maintain all programs and services that we have in place for our ELLs.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Our ELL's are included in all programs and activities that are available in our school. All notices sent home for parents attention 
regarding available programs are bilingual. Additionally, our Parent Coordinator reaches out to our ELL community and makes 
them aware of and explains the programs available to their children. We have after school Literacy and Math programs as well 
as Enrichment programs.  ELL's are involved in all of these. Our school offers ELA and Math support to students in grades 3-5 in 
our Afterschool Program. The Drama Program for grades 1-5 is available to all students. We have an early morning Reading 
Program for grade 3 students. We also have a Saturday Homework Help Program for all students in all grades. Every Spring we 
target ELL families to participate in our Parents as Arts Partners Program. It introduces them to theater, dance, and music. We 
provide Guidance services to all students, as well as our Parent Coordinator, a Resource Coordinator, and special school wide 
activities. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Our instructional materials include Harcourt Journeys and Go Math, Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT, Heinle Picture 
Dictionaries and Workbooks, a variety of bilingual Books, Rosetta Stone Language Program, as well as a host of other language 
related software. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

We support the native language literacy of our ELL's by having bilingual dictionaries, glossaries, as well as dual language books 
and electronic translators available for their use in both the classroom and at home.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  
All of the services and supports, as well as the resources that are used to enhance ELL's English language development 
correspond to their ages and grade levels. The required support services and resources are age appropriate and grade 
appropriate . All ELL students follow grade level curriculum, the same as their non-ELL peers.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our instructional materials include Harcourt Journeys and Go Math, Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT, Heinle Picture 
Dictionaries and Workbooks, a variety of bilingual Books, Rosetta Stone Language Program, as well as a host of other language 
related software. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Before the school year commences, we provide all of our newly enrolled ELL's with packets that contain a wide variety of 
language learning activities and resources. All information and suggested resources are in Spanish and English. Additionally, we 
invite parents and students for a before-school ENL orientation and information session. Entrants who come in during the year 
are similarly provided for. In addition, they are assigned an English language buddy to help ease the transition to a new 
language. Further, they participate in various clubs, including the ESL Photo Club, which follows the Literacy Through 
Photography (LTP) program. All appropriate supports, including a range of technological supports, are provided for these 
students. In order to provide ELL's with support for the upcoming school year, students are offered the opportunity to attend 
the ENL Summer Program. Staff include, Janine Colon, Principal, Deborah Casey, Assistant Principal, Maria Rodriguez, Parent 
Coordiantor, Gina DiGiglio, Guidance Counselor, Julia Komito, Speech teacher, and Robert Burstein, ENL provider. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

As a K-5 school we currently offer none.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

a. Our Dual Language Kindergarten , first grade, & second grade classes are taught using the self-
contained model. EP's and ELL's are integrated 100% of the day. 
b. Instructional time is split half and half between English and Spanish. 
c. The classroom is color coded for each language. 
d. Emergent literacy is taught in both languages at the same time. 
Estrellita assessments and other student progress monitoring tools are used to assess comprehension 
and progress, in order for students to move from one building block to another. Estrellitas is a phonics-
based accelerated beginning Spanish reading program.  
The class follows a 50/50 schedule on two week cycles. Teachers use a color-coded system to indicate the 
language of instruction and communication in present use.They wear red aprons for Spanish instruction, 
and blue aprons for English. A sample schedule is: 8:15-8:30- unpack, 8:30-8:50- Wellness, 9:00-9:45- 
Math (Spanish), 9:45-10:30- Vocabulario, reunion de la manana, 10:40-11:20- Lunch, 11:20-12:15- 
Estrelliatas- fonica, 12:30- 1:25- Computers, 1:30- 1:55- reading, 1:55-2:20- snack, packup, dismissal.   
 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Professional Development is extended to all constituencies that interact with ELL's. The following is our calendar for PD for the 
current year: Strategies of Second Language Acquisition for new teachers - 10/24/2016, Writing Across the Content Areas for 
ELL's - 12/12/2016, Scaffolding Lessons for ELL's - 1/23/2017, Planning for ELLs and the Common Core Standards for ELL's - 
2/21/2017. Analyzing the NYSESLAT Modalities - 4/24/2017.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

We have professional development workshops scheduled for all teachers of our ELL students to assist them in lesson planning 
for our ELL students with respect to the Common Core Learning Standards. They are as follows: Common Core Lesson Planning 
and the English Language Learner, Instructional Support for ELL's using the Common Core, and Using the Danielson Rubric to 
Meet the Needs of English Language Learners.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
To assist ELL's as they transition from Elementary to Middle School, key personnel from the designated middle school come to 
speak to our students regarding school policy, curriculum, and extra-curriculum activities. In addition they are given a tour of 
the middle school building, as well as brochures, and an open-house for students and their parents. The support that we 
provide to our teachers and guidance counselors to assist with the transition from elementary to middle school, includes data 
on students, portfolio assessments, and binder assessments. "Teachers and our Parent Coordinator are also supported by the 
school leadership when assisting parents that are having difficulties with the application process or finding the best middle 
school fit for their child's needs. The Guidance Counselor receives professional development with respect to the NYSESLAT and 
interpreting NYSESLAT scores from ATS for ELL students.The ENL teacher also meets with the Guidance Counselor to explain 
potential difficulties ELL parents and students nmay experience as they make the transition to middle school. 
The following topics are scheduled for this school year to meet the 7.5 hours of training required for all staff. The Identification 
and Placement Process for ELL's, the Common Core Curriculum, ELL's and Balanced Literacy, and Math and the ENL 
Student.  Agendas, sign-in sheets and handouts of these trainings are maintained in the ENL classroom in a file.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
An initial meeting at the beginning of the school year is arranged with the parent and the ENL provider and our bilingual Parent 
Coordinator to discuss the goals of the program, how their child's language development progress will be both determined and 
developed, the results of language proficiency assessments, and how the school will provide supports for the language 
development needs of their child in the various content areas, as well as how they can partner with school to positively 
advance their child's language acquisition. Interpretation or translation is provided on-site by our Parent Coordinator. Near the 
end of the school year another meeting is held to discuss progress toward initial goals set and services and goals for the next 
school year.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parental involvement activities at P.S. 196 for parents of ELL's include the following:  A Spring ELL Arts Festival and Luncheon 
for ELL parents, parent workshops to inform parents of available resources and services within the community pertinent to 
their needs, and PD provided by the Parent Coordinator on the NY State ELA and Math exams. We also offer an after school 
Parent With Child ENL Program.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Janine Colon, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The primary language spoken by each parent is determined by our school through the use of the Home Language 
Identification Survey and a questionnaire sent to the home in Spanish and English requesting the same 
information with respect to the parent's primary or native language. Parents are asked to state which language 
they feel most comfortable and prefer to communicate in with school staff, as well as which language they wish to 
receive written school communications in. The results are tallied and help us determine what translation and 
interpretation services are needed. All parents are provided with the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities in a 
language appropriate version for each parent, which includes information regarding their rights with respect to 
translation and interpretation services.            
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63

Language  

The prefered langauge for both written 
and oral communication for the vast 
majority of our parents is Spanish. The 
primary language spoken by each parent 
is determined by our school through the 
use of the Home Language Identification 
Survey and a 

questionnaire sent to the home in 
Spanish and English requesting the same 
information with respect to the parent's 
primary or native language. The results 
are tallied and help us determine what 
translation and interpretation services 
are needed. All 347 homes of our 
students were surveyed; of these 48% of 
our parents speak Spanish with the 
balance speaking English as their primary 
language. We have communicated this 
information and provided for translation 
and interpretation services to our school 
community through our newsletter and 
through a language translation and 
interpretation services fact sheet thtat 
we have sent home.  

   

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A. 
 

 

 

 
 
Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services 
 
1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be 

distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.

Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

 

 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

The primary language spoken by our parents is determined within the first ten days of their child's entrance into our 
school. We keep a Parental Primary Languages Log with this information in our Main office. This information is also 
noted on student emergency cards and in ATS. We publish the results of our language interpretation and translation 
surveys in our school newsletter. We send home a separate language services fact sheet in multiple languages that 
discusses parents rights to these services and contains information on how they can access them. We include 
information contained in our Language Access Kit provided by the DOE's Translation and Interpretation Unit. Our 
school's safety plan has procedures in place to facilitate the provision of language access services to ensure that all 
parents feel welcome and each has access to all administrative offices. In addition we have appropriate bilingual 
signage throughout our school. Our Parent Coordinator has been trained on parental language access requirements 
and our school follows the procedures outlined on the Translation and Interpretation website with respect to 
translation and interpretation requirements. 

The primary language spoken by each parent is determined by our school through the use of the Home Language 
Identification Survey and a questionnaire sent to the home in Spanish and English requesting this information. The 
results are tallied and help us determine what 

translation and interpretation services are needed. All 344 homes of our students were surveyed; of these 48% of our 
parents speak Spanish with the balance speaking English as their primary language. We have communicated this 
information and provided translation and 

interpretation services to our school community through our newsletter. 

We provide written translation services to meet the needs identified by the parents above, by in house fully bilingual 
staff as well as contractors as necessary. We have provided translated Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities to our 
parents. We have forms available in the languages that we need, Spanish and English, as well as appropriate signage 
in our school. 

The procedure followed to provide written translation in a timely manner as follows: all known school documents and 
notices are translated in September so that they are readily available while all others are done on an as needed basis 
and distributed concurrently with monolingual English versions. This includes translations of Monthy newsletters, 
Academic Vocabulary glossaries for Math and ELA for parental use with their children and all Health notices. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

Oral interpretation services are provided in a similar manner at the Open House meetings, Parent Teacher 
Conferences, PTA meetings,Meet the Teacher Night and Parent Workshops. 

Parents were sent a letter in September 2015 apprising them of the availability of translation and interpretation 
services. Information was contained therein that explains how they can access these services, as well as the fact that 
they can come to the school and be assisted to access services necessary for them. This letter will be resent in 
February 2016. Additionally, parents are provided with the Parental Bill of Rights, the Parents Guide to Language 
Access, as well as seeing material related these services when they enter the school or go to the Main Office. Parents 
are always asked if they need such services when they visit the school and interact with staff.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Our school gathers information and feedback from parents with respect to the quality and availability of translation 
and interpretation services through the use of a parent survey, as well as through discussions at Parent Teacher 
Association meetings. This feedback is used by us to help us refine our provision of information and access with 
respect to Translation & Interpretation services for our parents and their families.
