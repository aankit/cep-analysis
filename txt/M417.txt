Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

Mission: At Frank McCourt High School (FMHS), we prepare our students to be articulate and effective 
communicators in every medium. In particular, we will develop students’ communication skills through their writing, 
presentations, classroom discussions and peer dialogue. In developing these skills, students will also sharpen their 
critical and analytical thinking. Every student will graduate from Frank McCourt High School armed with the curiosity 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

and intellect of a true life-long learner. We are committed to helping our students become engaged citizens and 
thoughtful civic leaders who can communicate their vision with clarity and eloquence. 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
We are in our 9th year with students from all 5 boroughs. Though we are screened, we have a range of students with 
a variety of academic experiences. Last year, our Parent Teacher Association (PTA) raised money to subsidize college 
trips, support our senior activities, support an art showcase, family events, refreshments for school events, and the 
continued implementation of Peer Group Connection, a research-based peer mentoring program, at our school. 

 

Our goals last year were: 

1.  To ensure the ongoing learning of staff to revise and create curriculum. We revised our internal approach to 
professional development and partnered with Mastery Collaborative, NYC SKills Lab, New Visions for Public 
Schools, Center for Supportive Schools, and EdxEdNY to ensure unique opportunities for staff to grow. Our 
staff membership in the renowned Math for America program and participation in restorative justice training 
also helped to enhance the work being done in monthly meeting professional development teams. 

2.  To increase the number of students who report that they have relationships with an adult or peer who they 

can go to to discuss community violations, social challenges, and individual emotional needs. We worked with 
staff on school culture, revamped our professional development teams, and brought Peer Group Connection 
to our school. Advisors surveyed students on their feelings of support and we responded to the surveys with 
focus groups and discussions to provide more student voice. 

3.  To create more opportunities to build positive school culture through collaboration with parents. In the 
previous school-year, we added some community service activities to our calendar to help students and 
parents share service work and celebrate together. Last year we tried to build on that by adding more 
activities to the calendar.  

 

We are a PROSE school and Living Lab member of the Mastery Collaborative who continued to host school visits with 
colleagues interested in looking at problem-based learning, mastery-based assessment and programming. Our work in 
these networks helps our team better implement the programmatic design features (around curriculum development 
and grading) that we believe support our students in achieving college readiness. We anticipate being able to 
continue our track record of more than 90% graduation rate including several students off cohort who will graduate 
before the end of their 6th year. Our teachers collaborate together regularly to ensure students receive specific 
feedback on their work, have an opportunity to revise, and are challenged with problems they can cooperate on to 
solve. We are committed to problem-based learning, integrating disciplines as part of the curriculum, and providing 
chances for students to apply their knowledge in real life situations. We provide choices to our students and use our 
established Advisory program to engage them and their families in collaborating for student success.  

 

As we developed our curriculum and communication systems- online grade book, school website, Advisory program- 
we also worked to develop a supportive school culture. We share space with 4 other schools in our campus, each with 
a unique feel. It is important for us that our students and families feel connected to our school, so we continue to look 
at projects and programs that can support the solidification of a Frank McCourt High School culture. Feedback from 
our School Survey reveals that we are struggling to connect with some students and to create a space where all 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

students feel connected to adults and supported. The diverse nature of our student body and disparate experiences 
with school of our families and students, contributes to some challenges in coming together, but we believe strongly 
that our diversity is a treasured asset to our community and we continue to look for ways to build a strong FMHS 
culture. To that end, we revised our Advisory curriculum and worked with the Center for Supportive Schools to 
implement Peer Group Connection. Our PTA is diligently engaged in fundraising efforts to support these programs and 
regularly provides feedback on program decisions in the School Leadership Team (SLT) meetings. 

This year, our plan is to continue to work on defining our school culture and integrating the diverse members of our 
community into existing and new rituals. We are also implementing a new set of schoolwide "outcomes" and rubrics 
that will be used to provide students with feedback about their progress. This work is in response to our School 
Survey responses, student feedback from informal surveys and an evaluation done of our curriculum by Learning 
centered Initiatives. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We have a small but growing ELL population with 18 current students entitled to ENL service. This is till less than 5% 
of our total school population, but we have many families who do not speak English at home and approximately 35% 
of our students are bilingual or learned a language other than English first. Our ELL's often perform well on long term 
tasks and utilize our well-developed revision policies, but several struggle with exam performance, including Regents 
exams. Our SLT and staff are working hard to engage more of the families of ELLs and those who do not speak English 
at home to be able to find more ways to collaborate on improving student academic engagement. 

We have 93 IEP students across the four grade levels with a variety of unique talents and needs. In addition to 
students on the autism spectrum and some diagnosed as emotionally disturbed, we have students with a host of 
language processing, memory, and anxiety disorders. We also have a large population of students with executive 
functioning challenges. Our special education team works diligently with the rest of our team to find innovative ways 
to support these diverse students and help them feel successful at school. Most of our supports are provided in the 
classroom in heterogeneous groupings, but this year we have grown our special education staff and will also be 
providing required support in special classes. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Through our implementation of Peer Group Connection; training of staff in Therapeutic Crisis Intervention and 
restorative circles protocols; and PTA/school collaborations, we demonstrated success creating systems to promote a 
Supportive Environment. We would like to continue that work through a schoolwide focus on how we provide and 
share feedback that will extend to our work on Rigorous Instruction.  

By focusing on feedback, rolling out a new, universal set of outcomes and rubrics to use, and revising the role student-

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
After 8 years, we continue to emphasize the development of a responsive and evolving curriculum. We value student 
driven exploration and collaborative problem solving. Core disciplines are integrated and many assessments rely on 
authentic tasks that engage students in thinking about the application of their new skills and knowledge in their 
communities.  

In 2017-18 we contracted with LCI (Learning Centered Initiative, Inc.) to review our curriculum. Their assessment 
included an evaluation of all the math, science, social studies and ELA curriculum at our school, and what they found 
was that the commitment to collaborative problem solving and use of rubrics for measuring student progress was 
strong, but that there were some courses with a less clearly identified focus and inconsistent design of authentic 
learning tasks.  

Despite the rigorous materials and challenging assessments students work on throughout their 4 years, small pockets 
of students struggle to engage and classroom observations indicated that, in an effort to provide support, some 
lessons are overstructured and struggle to provide enough space for students to engage critically with the material / 
texts provided. Over the life of our school, the number of students entering 9th grade with a 1.8 or lower on the 8th 
grade ELA exam has risen as has the number of students with 1.8 or lower on the math exam. Boys consistently earn 
lower GPAs than girls at the school, and students with IEPs often earn less credits over four years than those in 
general education.  

Based on review of Regents performance and credit accumulation, we have revised our approach to programming, 
adjusted staffing to support different student groups, and revised our grading policy. We have always believed in 
mastery as a model for assessment and continue to offer opportunities in the curriculum for students to revise and 
have access to extra time for accumulating credit. Where we want to continue our work is in our refinement of 
curriculum to create more opportunities for students to apply their knowledge and skills in authentic ways. We want 
students to better value and understand the feedback we are providing using rubrics and feel supported enough to 
take intellectual risks in the classroom.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Despite our best efforts, we continue to have students who identify in both the School Survey, small group discussions 
and one-on-one meetings with staff, that they believe there is a subculture of students who lack respect for peers or 
staff. Because of our efforts to inform and empower students to engage with us, an increased number of incidents 
were reported last year and investigations with the requisite mediation and family engagement were successful at 
reducing the discomfort of some students, but not all. And although we have developed a thoughtful Advisory 
curriculum that is used with much consistency by teacher-advisors, even as it provides a strong student-staff 
connection, it makes other student-teacher relationships difficult to navigate. School Survey results indicate a lack of 
trust between students and staff, so we are looking for ways to build more bridges between what happens in Advisory 
and the expectations and experiences students have in their other classes. 

We have decided to revise the 9th grade curriculum to include an introductory, cross disciplinary unit with a project 
that culminates in a presentation from 9th graders to 11th and 12th graders. The unit will focus on core outcomes 
that support student understanding of expectations around collaboration and self-regulation, and that provides and 
authentic audience. The unit is also an introduction to Problem Based Learning and the curriculum model 0th graders 
should experience throughout their time at FMHS. We hope to support 10th graders with a similar, interdisciplinary 
project in the mid-year that highlights for them the role that public demonstration of their work can have in 
improving their performance. Both project serve as models for the bi-annual Expos of student work the 11th and 12th 
graders engage in each year. 

In 2015-6, we piloted Student Led Conferencing for our spring family conferences with a single cohort of students. As 
those students become 12th graders and every other cohort has trained for at least one Student Led Conference (SLC) 
in a year, we have decided to leverage the opportunity those conversations allow by replacing the fall conferences 
with SLCs. Advisory curriculum will need to be refined to help students prepare for the meetings, and the changes will 
offer more opportunities for students and parents to learn about and provide feedback on the outcomes we will 
begin using this year. It will also offer a chance for students, staff and parents to engage in a discussion about 
academic expectations, the challenges in the curriculum and ways to find resources that will lead to college readiness. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

FMHS opened in 2010 with a strong commitment to Problem Based Learning as an instructional model and mastery-
based assessment as a model for feedback. We relied heavily on the work of the Buck Institute for models to design 
our courses and, as a member of the Mastery Collaborative, we have been working hard to refine our feedback 
system. Our teachers have engaged with the NYC SKillslab, Math for America, New Visions for Public Schools and 
others on their curriculum design and implementation, and we have devoted countless hours, including weekly 
collaborative planning time in the school day, to ensure that our courses are aligned to State and National standards 
for post-secondary readiness. We have 100% acceptance rate to college and more than 80% of those are matriculated 
in a post-secondary program after 2 years. 

Our school is extremely diverse, with students who travel to school from all over the five boroughs. Our students 
identify as 44% Hispanic, 30% white, 17% black and 5% Asian. We have more than a dozen feeder middle schools and 
integrate students with level 1.2 scores on the 8th grade exams with those who earn 4 or higher. Our population of 
ELL students or students who are former ELLs is growing and our special education population is evolving. Our staff is 
committed to ensuring that all students meet with success and make regular progress. We are committed to creating 
and improving our mastery-based learning model and finding multiple ways to measure student growth. 

That said, each cohort of students present different challenges and our staff is deeply interested in growing their 
expertise and arsenal of strategies to work with specific student needs. As staff seek opportunities to learn 
management strategies; develop their questioning skills; and find reading programs for our most struggling students, 
we have seen student engagement shift. our most recent School Survey indicates that too many students are not 
feeling challenged by the curriculum and we have not spent as much time with staff looking at Danielson's 3c - 
Engaging Students in the Learning. In an effort to refine our curriculum planning and design more authentic projects 
for students to demonstrate their learning, we are going to focus on ways to better engage all students in challenging 
problems. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, teacher grade teams will have engaged in training and a least 3 protocols to review provide feedback on 
unit plans; norm FMHS schoolwide rubrics; and review student work.

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Collaborative Teachers and strategies 
to promote teacher-parent/family collaborations in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and 
identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
The lower house (9th and 10th grade ) and upper house (11th and 12th grade) will each have uniform grading policies 
that include definitions of mastery and revisions to be used across the 2 grade teams. Handbooks for families and 
students will be revised to include information about the policies and mechanisms for learning related tools - both 
rubrics and PBL units. New FMHS outcomes will be published and posted online and in the school community. 
Curriculum Night, conference nights and during Student lead Conferences, new policies and materials will be 
incorporated and surveys administered to families. SLT will regularly convene and work with FMHS Cabinet to solicit 
family and student feedback about curriculum changes.

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Our recent Quality Review and School Survey indicate that school staff feel empowered to make decisions and lead 
school programs and projects, but students and parents are looking for more opportunities to share feedback and feel 
part of the distributed leadership model of the school. In the past, the SLT has worked to create opportunities for 
students and parents to collaborate with staff on community service projects and a club funding program. We have 
also worked together to bring Peer Group Connection to our school and we recently created a position for a parent 
coordinator to join our staff and support more family - school leadership projects. 

We have noticed that participation in conferences falls off as students age through the school with approximately 
80% of 9th grade families participating, but fewer than 50% of 12th grade families attending. We notice that student 
leaders tend to be in the 11th or 12th grade, with few 9th or 10th graders taking on leadership roles in clubs or 
extracurricular activities outside of sports; and we are looking to revamp the role of student government at FMHS to 
create a more representative body that can offer feedback on school initiatives and create their own programs.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, students, staff and parent groups will collaborate to develop a project to support 80% family participation 
in school programs like Student Led Conferencing, Expo of student work, and/or community service.

Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Last year, despite responses from more than 100 parents, participation in the School Survey by our families is limited 
and, though feedback suggests some improvement in the access to information and accessibility of staff felt by 
parents, we are interested in finding more ways to engage families in the school community. The SLT has been 
working to identify ways for us to build bridges of communication and support more transparency between the school 
and families. We designed a new agenda for our annual Curriculum Night event; we developed two community 
service activities to engage families in positive school value work; and we rallied around the implementation of the 
Peer Group Connection curriculum. 

In an effort to build on the collaboration of staff and parents, we want to include more projects with students. Our 
PTA is sponsoring the design and rollout of a new FMHS school website, and we have hired a parent coordinator for 
the first time in our history. We want to make sure to engage more families and better track the engagement of 
students whose parents connect with the school. We will focus on making sure that families are engaged in the 
important rituals that contribute most to an FMHS culture (like Student Led Conferences, bi-annual Expo of student 
work, annual Art Show, etc.), and we want to grow participation with subcommittees for the things that students and 
parents care about. We are considering implementation of book clubs, a cross-constituent admissions team, and a 
"school pride" committee. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, 80% of parents surveyed will indicate that they have used the new FMHS school website or participated in 
at least one FMHS community event.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Frank McCourt High School , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part 
A of the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Frank McCourt High School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and as 
much as possible in languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act Act; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
We typically do not have early literacy ELLs at our school.  Most ELLs at our school are long term ELLs or middle school admits 
who have been successful in other bilingual or ENL programs.  All students are assessed using Performance Series exams at the 
beginning of 9  th   and 10  th   grade (when 90% of our students are admitted). We also use school-based assessment in 
September of each year to develop an understanding of student performance on our school-based rubrics. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

All Humanities teachers provide the baseline assessments in the early weeks of school and the data is shared through our 
Jumprope SIS.  Performance Series is administered through the Mastery Lab period and data also shared in Jumprope. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

 

Our goal is always to prepare students for success on the ELA Regents exam by the time they reach January of 11  
th   grade.  We are working, in our regular curriculum, to ensure that all students, including ELLs, meet at least a 65 on the 
exam though we support them to strive for the CUNY benchmark of 75.  We have been successful with 99% of  students to-
date. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Our Advisory program provides opportunities to review data with students and their families; teachers are provided with 
information through our partnership with New Visions for Public Schools; and regular grade team meetings will allow for 
teams to plan strategic interventions in and out of the classroom. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
NA  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
We have never tested more than 6 students a year on the NYSESLAT (in 5 years of testing).  We had strong success moving 
General Education students from what used to be Intermediate to Advanced level or to testing out.  Even with the change last 
year, only one tested student did not improve his level.  We continue to struggle with students with IEP services to improve 
their levels, but we believe this has more to do with IEP designation than ELL status. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Our Advisory program provides opportunities to review data with students and their families; teachers are provided with 
information through our partnership with New Visions for Public Schools; and regular grade team meetings will allow for 
teams to plan strategic interventions in and out of the classroom. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Students are serviced in math, science and Humanities classes based on the number of required minutes per week.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

NA 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

NA 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

ENL is currently provided by teachers shared with another campus school.  Students meet in co-teaching classes for 90 
minutes a week which includes instruction in strategies to support literacy and language development.  ELA instruction is 
provided  for 5 - 90 minute blocks per week.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Content is delivered in all classes  in English. Glossaries, picture dictionaries, and other translated materials (print and digital) 
are used to make content comprehensible. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

We currently work with a campus school to enable students to be evaluated in the home language when it is Spanish.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Differentiation strategies for all ELLs include: the use of graphic organizers; extended time on assessments; guided support for 
reading; strategic check-ins for projects/assessments; revisiting directions in the classroom; provision of oral and written 
materials (eg. books on tape) when available; use of online tools and resources to support language acquisition and literacy 
development; paired reading protocols.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Differentiation strategies for all ELLs (including IEP mandates) include: the use of graphic organizers; extended time on 
assessments; guided support for reading; strategic check-ins for projects/assessments; revisiting directions in the classroom; 
provision of oral and written materials (eg. books on tape) when available; use of online tools and resources to support 
language acquisition and literacy development; paired reading protocols.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
All students are in the least restrictive environment.  The SPED team has members on: the PPT to review at-risk students and 
identify strategies to support IEP ELLs and others; LPT to engage in the evaluation process, work with students and their 
families and liaise with the rest of the SPED team; and department teams to support curriculum development and the inclusion 
of modifications to assessments, instructional strategies and groupings of students as necessary. Placements are determined in 
consultation with SPED teachers, general education teachers, the student and families and accommodations are made on a 
case-by-case basis to ensure students get targeted support. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
All interventions are provided in English and cut across disciplines to the areas of need for individual ELLs.  Students benefit 
from parallel teaching instruction; counseling support groups; strategic in-class grouping; guided instruction (additional 
checklists, directions, check-ins); before/after school peer and teacher tutoring; supplemental materials; integration of a 
paraprofessional or additional teacher for specific lessons. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We have teachers in the process of preparing for their TESOL extension and, with their support, we are considering additional 
interventions in the 9  th    and 10  th   grade to support students fluency.  Sessions could be built into an existing class all 
students participate in so that ELLs can get more targeted support with a third teacher.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

None   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are entitled to participation in all activities and have access to all services as other students.  PSAL, clubs, campus activities 
and special arts initiatives are accessible to ELLs.  They have no program conflicts or service provisions that would exclude 
them from these opportunities.  Teacher-led and peer tutoring are also available to all students. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Instructional strategies for all ELLs in all subject areas  include: the use of graphic organizers; extended time on assessments; 
guided support for reading; strategic check-ins for projects/assessments; revisiting directions in the classroom; provision of 
oral and written materials (eg. books on tape) when available; use of online tools and resources to support language 
acquisition and literacy development; paired reading protocols.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

NA  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Because of the number of students in our program, all support and service is individualized based on review of data from 
students' prior year's performance.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Instructional strategies for all ELLs in all subject areas  include: the use of graphic organizers; extended time on assessments; 
guided support for reading; strategic check-ins for projects/assessments; revisiting directions in the classroom; provision of 
oral and written materials (eg. books on tape) when available; use of online tools and resources to support language 
acquisition and literacy development; paired reading protocols.   
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
All newly enrolled ELLs are surveyed, assessed, and engaged in a discussion with LPT members.  The guidance counselor 
coordinates the integration of new students and serves as point for the team and student during the transition.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish Literature / AP Spanish 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

NA

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
All teachers participate in weekly professional development meetings.  Twice a month- in department teams and research 
groups- teachers engage in research and training in instructional strategies to support all students.  The focus on much of the 
department work has been to integrate CCLS into instruction and to develop successful measures of progress for all students. 
See 1    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
We use Googledocs to record all meeting agendas and to collect notes from meetings.  Based on the 15% rule, we more than 
cover the 5 necessary professional development sessions by engaging in bi-monthly meetings of instructional strategies and 
assessment development.    
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Because we have so few ELL students, LPT members address ELL service needs and family expectations in individual 
meetings.  We have school staff available for Spanish translation and we use the phone-based translation service provided by 
DOE for other languages.  Advisors support these meetings by representing content teachers and synthesizing information 
about strategies used to support the students.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Danielle Salzberg, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Our school uses ATS data, school events and conferences and a review of the blue cards to confirm language 
preferences. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Our website is able to be translated into a variety of languages and we have asked families to complete a form to be 
able to contact them with the CAASS system. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Staff are provided with information about Chancellor's Regulation A-663 at the beginning of the year. Digital versions 
of materials to use with parents and the information on how to use phone translation is also provided. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

All materials are posted on our floor of our campus- the Welcome Poster by our main office, the Parents' Bill of Rights 
by our main office, and the Parents' Guide to Language Access by our main office. There is also a Language ID guide at 
the main security desk shared by all campus schools. Our school secretary is aware of how to find translation support 
for families and preferred contact languages. Advisors- the main point of contact for our families- also have access to 
materials for supporting families who prefer to communicate in a language other than English. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

Feedback is gathered from families at major events through surveys and through contact between advisors and 
families. The information about specific family needs is shared through our internal SIS (Jumprope) so staff can see 
individual family needs and update DOE systems as needed. Aggregated information is shared with SLT and cabinet 
members for planning purposes.
