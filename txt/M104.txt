Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

Simon Baruch strives to expose students to a rigorous instructional program in the core content areas and 
supplements the core content areas with a rich arts, technology and physical education curriculum. An emphasis is 
placed on developing the whole child through the balance of rigorous core content and engaging enrichment classes 
that allow students to develop their interests and abilities in all areas of learning.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Simon Baruch MS 104 is a middle school located in the Gramercy Park area of New York City servicing students in 
grades six through eight. The student body of the school is diverse with the following demographic breakdowns: 22% 
Hispanic, 1% American Indian/ Alaskan, 34 Asian, 7% Black and 36% White. 

 

The development of literacy skills in our students are embedded across all content areas to ensure that students are 
prepared to meet the demands of the common core standards. Across the content areas, students are engaged in 
writing tasks that require them to state claims and defend them with text based evidence, exposed to complex texts, 
and engage in discussions with their peers to explore concepts. In addition to developing students’ academic ability 
we are also committed to ensuring that we develop civic minded students that contribute to the community. The 
members of the faculty work with students to create a safe learning environment that is welcoming and respectful of 
all members of the school community. Our advisory program is delivered to all students and addresses topics that will 
help students develop positive habits, healthy relationships, prepare for high school and beyond, and explore issues 
that impact our society.  

This school year, we will be implementing the Teachers College Units of Study for Reading and Writing in our ELA 
classes. This shift will increase the amount of independent reading that students engage in, as well as increase the 
volume of student writing.  

We are partners with the Urban Advantage program, a collaboration between DOE schools and major science 
institutions throughout the city (American Museum of Natural History, NY Hall of Science, Botanical Garden, Bronx 
Zoo, Staten Island Zoo). Teachers are able to engage in professional development at these institutions which allow 
them to utilize the various institutions as a way to connect classroom learning to real world examples. In addition a 
number of the science teachers in our school are now lead teachers for the Urban Advantage program. They work to 
develop curriculum units of study that are then used in schools throughout the city. 

Our partnership with Manhattan Youth ensures that all students are provide with a vast array of after school 
activities. Program offerings include the areas of athletics, performing arts, visual arts, academic support and 
enrichment, technology and STEM education. Our extensive after school program also provides students with 
opportunities to experience rich extracurricular activities. 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The school is unique in that it serves as a zone school for families who live within the designated catchment area, but 
also has a screened, application based SP program for gifted and talented students. In addition to the SP program, the 
school has the General Academic program and offers the full array of services for students with special needs. MS 104 
prides itself on servicing students of all academic levels and works diligently to meet the needs of all learners.. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

The school received a Well Developed in four out of five categories on its last Quality Review in the 2015-16 school 
year and is meeting or exceeding all targets for the categories on the School Quality Guide. The school is exceeding its 
targets in student achievement and closing the achievement gap. The school community believes that through our 
strong alignment, both horizontally and vertically, rigorous instruction, and commitment to ensuring that all students 
can access this curriculum, and looking at student work collaboratively that have contributed to these successes. The 
school has a culture of collaboration amongst the staff and values colleagues being provided with opportunities to 
work with one another on curriculum, assessment and reviewing student progress. Time is created in all teacher 
programs to ensure that they are able to work with grade level colleagues on this work. The school’s organizational 
structure also allows for greater knowledge of students. Teacher teams are grouped in “houses”, sharing the classes 
they teach amongst one another. This allows for the teams to plan together and strategize as to how to meet the 
needs of the students they teach. 

Our school community has worked diligently to create an environment that nurtures students, fosters teacher 
development and collaboration and establishes a safe environment in which all members can depend on another for 
support. With this foundation firmly in place, we are prepared to continue our strong focus on providing students 
with quality instruction in all classrooms. This year will be implementing the Teachers College Reading and Writing 
Units of Study in our English Language Arts classrooms across all grades. Our goal is to increase the amount of 
independent reading that students engage in, offer increased opportunities for choice in the books students read and 
topics they write about, and provide students with access to texts that are at appropriate levels of challenge for all 
learners. We will also continue to shift our practice to more student-centered tasks and classroom environments and 
provide targeted scaffolds that are specific to individual student needs, with the goal of moving students of all 
performance levels towards greater levels of independence. Our school will continue its work around the social 
emotional aspect of the middle school educational experience. We will work as a staff on continuing to build a culture 
that values and celebrates the diversity within our school community and ensures respect for all members of our 
community.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Simon Baruch MS 104, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of 
the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

[Simon Baruch MS 104] will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., NCLB/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association)  

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Rationale: 
Our Title III program is an after-school support for all ELLs grades 6, 7 and 8. All students 
currently receiving ENL services will be invited. The focus of the program will be on academic 
language development. The support will be literacy based as our 2018 statewide ELA scores 
show that this is an area of need. None of our current ELLs scored a 3 or 4 on the NYS ELA 
exam. 50% scored a 1 on the ELA exam. We have projected a number 50 of our ELL's to be 
served, half of whom, according to the EDAT, did not progress to a higher proficiency level. 
The theme for our after-school program is Perseverance and Overcoming Obstacles. Students 
will engage with nonfiction texts, poems and novels centered around this theme. Each group will 
learn literacy skills through a Balanced Literacy approach and engage in interactive book study 
activities such as small group discussions, Socratic Seminar, reading workshop, and shared 
reading with the teacher. Students will each have their own copy of the book and the teacher will 
also use audio versions of the book to support students as needed. The entering/emerging level 
groups will read "Emmanuel's Dream: The True Story of Emmanuel Ofosu Yeboah" by Laurie 
Ann Thompson, and the transitioning level groups will read "El Deafo" by Cece Bell, and the 
expanding level groups will read "A Whole New Ballgame" by Phil Bildner. The teachers will 
also use Perspectives for a Diverse America from teachingtolerance.org as a resource for 
planning lessons around concepts of tolerance and diversity. In addition, this resource has many 
nonfiction texts centered around our theme for teachers to use for close reading activities, 
reading workshop, discussion and shared readings. The skills taught in the after-school program 
align with the Next Generation Learning Standards for ELA and will also reinforce the skills 
practiced in the ELA class from the Teacher's College Reading and Writing Workshop model. In 
addition to the book study, students will also receive additional support in developing and 
improving skills affecting performance on classroom assignments and standardized tests. These 
skills include: listening and note taking, decoding, reading comprehension skills, grammatical 
structure, academic vocabulary development & analyzing reading across disciplines. Online 
software programs that will also be used to support students in all groups include Imagine 
Learning (funded by Title III), ESL Brainpop (funded by Title III) Study Island, Flocabulary, 
Duolingo, and NewsELA. The Performance Series will be used to assess and monitor student 
progress.  Additionally, teachers will use supplemental readings from Scholastic magazines such 
as Action, Scope and Junior Scholastic to facilitate lessons and instruction around non-fiction 
reading skills. 
 
Subgroups and Grade Levels: 
Grade 6-7: Entering and Emerging 
Grade 6-7: Transitioning and Expanding 
Grade 8: Entering and Emerging 
Grade 8: Transitioning and Expanding 
 
Groups will be based on proficiency levels/grade (ensuring that no more than two contiguous 
grades are in each section). We will have two groups with two teachers co-teaching and

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
 MS104 uses a variety of assessment tools to assess the literacy skills of our ELL population. For reading (decoding and text 
comprehension skills) the ESL teachers collect running records at least three times a year, interview the students and use a 
web-based program called Performance Series to measure students' Lexile levels and literacy skills. Within the first two weeks 
of school, the students take an online baseline assessment offered by the website in order to measure their reading abilities 
and help ESL teachers design their instructional plan for individual students. All data is shared with teachers and 
administration to tailor instruction. This assessment is then taken at the midpoint of the year and student gains are analyzed 
to reassess and guide instructional planning. Finally, the Performance Series is taken once more at the end of the year to 
measure student growth and inform instructional decisions for the following year. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

For writing, the teachers use the Teacher's College K-8 Continuum for Assessing a personal narrative written at the beginning 
of the school year. The writing is graded according to a NYS Learning Standards writing rubric designed by the school. In 
addition, the students are continually assessed on a weekly basis through formative assessments such as reading response 
conferences, skill building activities and questioning and discussion strategies. These formative assessments inform 
instructional planning for ELLs by identifying what specific skills where individual students may need additional support. 
 
According to the data available, most of our students were born outside of the United States and are literate in their first 
language. A great number of the students have decoding skills in English, but lack text comprehension ability. As for writing, 
most of our students require direct grammar instruction and vocabulary knowledge. In addition, when testing our students' 
early literacy skills, it is evident that they need a lot of guidance and support while writing formal compositions.    
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

At MS104, we use data gathered from benchmark and formative assessments to plan guided reading groups and individual 
reading conferences to support our efforts to advance student literacy. Assessment results are shared with the Language 
Proficiency Team as well as with the general teachers of ELLs to ensure that student literacy needs are met across the 
curriculum. General teachers of ELLs meet with the ELL specialist at least once each week during common planning periods to 
review student data as well as plan and modify instruction. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
MS 104 uses Performance Series, the ELL Periodic Assessment, as well as data from NYSITELL scores (for incoming ELLs), to 
identify student baselines, progress and areas of need regarding language proficiency. In addition, the NY State ELA and Math 
scores are used to monitor students' grade level academic progress. Finally, we use the EDAT to assess student risk factors and 
address student needs, both at the beginning of the year and continually as the year progresses. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

MS 104 uses Peformance Series, the ELL Periodic Assessment, as well as data from NYSITELL scores (for incoming ELLs), to 
identify student baselines, progress and areas of need regarding language proficiency. In addition, the NY State ELA and Math 
scores are used to monitor students' grade level academic progress. Finally, we use the EDAT to assess student risk factors and 
address student needs, both at the beginning of the year and continually as the year progresses. All progress is monitored by 
ELL and general teachers to inform classroom instruction.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
At MS 104, the ENL teachers work in collaboration with administration and content teachers. Content teachers refer students 
based on classroom performance allowing ENL teachers to identify struggling ELLs. At Tier 1, a differentiated curriculum is 
implemented with a focus on academic language development across the content areas. At Tier 2, in addition to a 
differentiated curriculum with a focus on language development, students are given additional small group instruction within 
the classroom. This instruction involves targeted supports regarding vocabulary or content knowledge. At Tier 3, students are 
referred to AIS which includes small group instruction as well as one-on-one support in a pull-out setting. Data informs all of 
our school's decisions within the RTI framework. First, teachers use the EDAT tool to identify students who may be at risk 
during the school year based on state-wide assessment performance and learning disabilities. Teachers document and review 
student performance in the classroom and the lowest third of students receive Tier-2 support. Within that group, students 
who do not show sufficient measurable improvement are referred for Tier-3 services. At the end of each marking period, 
student's progress is re-evaluated to determine if a formal evaluation regarding special education services is required. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
MS 104 uses data from the NYSESLAT, NYS ELA and Math scores, as well as the final Performance Series assessment, to guide 
instruction for the upcoming year. We use the data to measure student growth and to look for both areas of success as well as 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

areas for improvement in student learning. The information from these assessments allows the school to adjust our ELL 
programs as needed. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Teachers look at data from these assessments collaboratively in inquiry groups during in-school professional development 
sessions. These occurs throughout the year so that teachers can make adjustments to their instruction as well as to curriculum 
in an ongoing manner. Teacher groups meet regularly with school leaders to ensure that program adjustments are meeting 
students' needs and allowing them to progress. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

 Students receive ENL instruction in both integrated and standalone settings. ELLs receive integrated ENL instruction 
in blocks; these classes consist of students of the same grade level and are heterogeneously mixed with ELLs and non-
ELLs. Integrated ENL is implemented through team teaching with the general teacher providing content with the ELL 
specialist providing language support and task modifications as needed to endure access for students of all proficiency 
levels. Integrated ENL occurs across all subject areas, and specifically in ELA for entering, emerging, and transitioning 
ELLs. The ELL specialist works with content-area teachers to implement language supports across the curriculum. 
Entering, emerging, and transitioning students receive standalone ENL instruction, and they are grouped 
heterogeneously in an ungraded setting with a certified ENL teacher, with groups of no more than two contiguous 
grades in the same class.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A  

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

 There are two full-time ENL teachers at Simon Baruch Middle School who monitor ELL data. Students are programmed 
according to their scores from the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL. They are programmed in the official schedule to ensure they 
receive the accurate number of instructional minutes as per the revised CR part 154. Each ENL teacher then receives a 
schedule that allows them to deliver integrated ENL with a content teacher, as well as standalone ENL, for each ELL, as 
needed. Entering, emerging, transitioning, and expanding ELLs receive at least 180 minutes of integrated ENL in their grade-
level ELA classroom. Commanding students and former ELLs who tested out in the previous two years receive at least 90 
minutes of integrated ENL in their grade-level classroom. Integrated ENL is delivered in a team-teaching setting with a general 
teacher collaborating with an ENL-certified teacher to ensure that all content is modified for various language proficiencies. 
Different co-teaching methods such as parallel teaching, station teaching, or alternative teaching are used according to 
student needs and tasks to ensure that all students achieve the class objectives. In addition, entering students receive 180 
minutes of standalone ENL taught by a certified ENL teacher in a small group focusing on essential language skills needed 
across the curriculum. Emerging and transitioning students receive 90 minutes of standalone ENL taught by a certified ENL 
teacher in a small group.        

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
 
As a freestanding ENL program, the language of instruction is English. The content classes are taught through NYS Next 
Generation Learning Standards-based units that culminate with assessments aligned to NYS Learning Standards in each core 
subject area. These assessments include essays and on-demand writing graded on the state ELA exam rubric, as well as 
mathematics performance tasks from the Connected Mathematics Program curriculum. Social studies teachers are guided by 
the NYS Learning Standards as well as the NYC Scope and Sequence, and science teachers use the Next Generation Science 
Standards and the NYS Learning Standards in the sciences to plan rigorous standards-based instruction. All teaching involves 
backwards planning, and is research based and data driven. Content area teachers and ENL teachers plan collaboratively so 
that all students may have access to instruction and engage with final assessments. Teachers use the Bilingual Common Core 
Progressions to guide scaffolding and differentiation decisions, and classroom instruction involves the tenets of sheltered 
instruction, such as the SIOP model, to ensure maximum comprehension on the part of ELLs and deep engagement in all 
aspects of classroom instruction. Specific instructional approaches and methods used to make content comprehensible in the 
integrated ENL classroom include teaching academic vocabulary intensively across several days using a variety of techniques, 
integrating oral and written English language instruction into content area teaching, providing regular structured opportunities 
to read for multiple purposes, providing regular opportunities to develop written language skills, and capitalizing on students’ 
home language skills and knowledge. Depending on a student's language progress, scaffolds may be added or gradually 
removed as needed to ensure that ELLs meet the demands of the NYS Learning Standards. Each content area emphasizes 
reading, writing, speaking and listening through a variety of tasks including but not limited to on-demand writing, class 
discussions, lab reports and experiments, DBQ essays, etc. 
 
 
Native language support is provided across the curriculum in the form of glossaries including important, content-specific Tier 3 
words, as well as academic language (Tier 2) words. The ENL teachers also reinforce this vocabulary in standalone ENL settings, 
and content teachers post and refer to these words on their word walls. Students use translations based on those words, 
which they keep in their notebooks or binders, and which are also posted in the classroom. Entering and emerging students 
are also encouraged to use their native language for discussions and clarification with their same-language peers and bilingual 
teaching staff. MS 104 makes strategic use of bilingual teachers, paraprofessionals, guidance counselors and other support 
staff to ensure that students get the most out of classroom instruction. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

The Spanish LAB is administered when Spanish-speaking ELLs are first admitted into the NYC school system. This tool helps 
teachers determine language skills in Spanish. The student's performance on the Spanish LAB helps the ENL teachers to better 
understand his/her native language academic background and schooling skills. If applicable, the SIFE Oral Interview 
Questionnaire is also used to further collect data on the student's schooling history. The information collected from the 
Spanish LAB and other assessments on the student's first language is utilized by the ENL and subject teachers when planning 
instruction and group work. Because students acquire literacy most effectively in the language that is most familiar to them, 
students are encouraged to use both their home language as well as the target language (English) to practice reading and 
writing skills. Were MS104 to have a dual language or transitional bilingual program, students would have ongoing 
assessments in academic content areas as well as language development in two languages. This assessment would match the 
language of instruction and programmatic goals.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 
6a.  To address the needs of our SIFE students, age appropriate, high interest/beginner level reading materials have been 
ordered for the ENL and other content classes. The literacy and math coaches help teachers to assess the student’s reading 
level and computational skills.  If necessary, we hire a translator to assess the student’s strengths and weaknesses in other 
content areas and would provide additional support for this student after school. In addition, a progress report system was 
established on a weekly basis for the student. This strategy will be followed by the implementation of protocols, rubrics and 
checklists focusing on the elimination of the achievement gap. In the future, were 104 to receive a lot of SIFE students, we 
would design a program to more specifically address their needs and apply for a SIFE ELL grant. 
6b. Our newcomers require more scaffolding strategies including picture/visual support as well as direct instruction in order to 
make the content comprehensible and attainable. Books with accompanying audio are utilized to increase fluency and 
familiarize the students with the cadence of English. Teachers employ sheltering techniques such as guarded vocabulary, 
gestures and actions, videos and adapted text as well as translated materials to support in-class work. Differentiating 
instruction is critical with these students. The Bilingual Common Core Progressions help teachers plan for and assess students 
needs and capabilities, as well as to set content and language goals. The ENL teacher spends time scaffolding the level of 
difficulty of practice reading passages. Teaching students how to use word-to-word dictionaries, web translators and literacy 
programs, accessing prior knowledge and teaching about cognates are among the strategies the ENL teacher uses with these 
students.  
6c. For our Developing ELLs, additional assessments monitor their academic and language growth. Students are taught through 
CCLS-based curriculum that is adapted with ENL strategies to better support these students. Academic vocabulary 
development is emphasized as students now have a strong Tier 1 vocabulary foundation. The curriculum is organized around 
essential questions and protocol guidelines to help them to better understand projects and activities they are asked to 
accomplish in the CCLS-based curriculum. In addition, the students are also involved in a mentoring/consulting program in 
which the ENL teacher checks-in with the general education teachers to set a weekly plan that includes ENL reading and 
writing strategies, vocabulary study and targeted grammar instruction. 
6d.  Our Long Term ELL students are the focus of our AIS team. We carefully analyze their data to determine what type of 
intervention is necessary for individual students. These students have English conversational fluency, but lack academic 
linguistic skills that lead to difficulties in coping with content itself. Therefore, they need gains in both academic language and 
content learning. In order to help these students, the ENL teachers provide them with explicit vocabulary and text 
comprehension instruction through a systematic weekly skill learning initiative. This school wide program was specifically 
designed to meet the needs of our struggling students. It enables us to collect data and design lesson plans that address our 
students' needs. 
6e. Former ELLs are provided support for two years in the form of integrated content area ENL as per CR Part 154.2. The ENL 
teachers employ a collaborative model in which they work with teachers to support students in either math, science, social 
studies or ELA classes. Instruction is differentiated for former ELLs through the team-teaching model to allow for targeted 
interventions in reading, writing, speaking, and listening. They also receive the same test accommodations as ELLs: extended 
time, separate location, use of word to word dictionaries. If available, they are provided with translated editions of 
standardized subject tests in their native language or a translator is hired through the DOE.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
MS 104 teachers collaborate with learning specialists to employ different strategies involving differentation, scaffolding, and 
interventions that support ELL-SWDs English language development and grade-level academic development. Special education 
teachers (in the self-contained classroom, and the ICT classroom) as well as SETSS teachers, ensure that students receive all 
their mandated accomodations and modifications according to their IEPs. ENL teachers inform these teachers as well as 
students' content area teachers of the students' proficiency levels according to the most recent NYSESLAT or NYSITELL scores. 
Together, the teachers then develop individualized plans targeting their language and content development based on students 
academic and language proficiency needs. In order for students to develop academically and linguistically, even if they have 
disabilities, 104 ensures they have the same access and interaction with grade-level texts. Instruction is based on mainly two 
approaches: First, using principles outlined in the sample Common Core-aligned units from the American Institute for Research 
and the Bilingual Common Core Progressions, teachers use protocols that ensure tasks and texts are appropriately scaffolded 
for students. Instruction involves previewing an activating prior knowledge on a topic; focusing on and teaching essential Tier 2 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

and Tier 3 vocabulary (and Tier 1 vocabulary if necessary); building and enhancing background knowledge; interacting with and 
participating in activities with appropriate supports in the form of word banks, glossaries, sentence starters and frames, 
graphic organizers, which allows students access to a variety of reading, writing, speaking and listening tasks; and then 
reviewing and summarizing instructional lessons and units. Second, teachers ensure all instruction is aligned with the research-
based recommendations outlined in the "Teaching Academic Content and Literacy to English Learners in Elementary and 
Middle School" published by What Works Clearinghouse in 2014. Teachers teach academic vocabulary words intensively across 
several days, integrate oral and written English language instruction into teaching, and provide regular structured 
opportunities to develop written skills. In their special education settings, students receive small-group instruction particularly 
focused on the areas of literacy they are struggling in. Teachers strategically use technology to support ELL-SWD learning 
across the content areas. For students who struggle with reading, iPads and iPod touches allow them to receive audio support 
either with online texts or eBooks. Online programs such as Achieve3000, Newsela, and Learning Ally also allow students to 
access grade-level content that is differentiated for their reading level but increases in difficulty as students progress through 
the program. Teachers regularly use Google Apps such as Google Translate and Google Docs to allow students who need the 
support to write in their home language and then translate their thoughts and ideas into English. This allows entering students 
to engage cognitively with academic tasks and develop their English skills as they become more proficient. 
  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
 MS104 uses curricular, instructional and scheduling flexibility to meet the needs of ELLs-SWDs within the least restrictive 
environment. Our school provides a SETSS, ICT and 12:1 self-contained program that allows for ENL instruction regardless of 
classroom setting. The IEP determines the least restrictive environment for each student. The ENL teacher uses the material 
that the subject area teacher is using and provides native language and scaffolding supports within the classroom. The special 
education requirements are aligned with the LAP. In addition, the ENL teachers carefully plan the program so there are no 
scheduling conflicts with other providers or classes.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
 
MS104 offers ELL students a great variety of targeted intervention programs. These programs are designed to provide the 
students with additional support in subject areas. At the beginning of the school year, teachers are provided with students' 
standardized exam scores to determine who might benefit from Academic Intervention Services (AIS) in English, math, social 
studies and/or science on the basis of standardized test scores, students' previous report cards and portfolios, and information 
provided from the EDAT. These students are monitored for possible needed interventions.   
 
As a school that receives Title III funding, we offer all ELLs rich instructional classes using formative assessments aligned to the 
Common Core Standards. Our struggling readers and writers are also targeted and receive extended intervention services. The 
reading intervention occurs during dedicated reading classes as well as Literacy Lab. Teachers use Achieve3000 in combination 
with guided reading strategies to build students' literacy skills. The program is based on extensive research in academic 
reading instruction. It combines authentic, nonfiction reading experiences with active literacy and audio assisted learning to 
help students develop word recognition, phonemic and phonological awareness, vocabulary knowledge, comprehension, and 
fluency skills. Additionally, reading teachers use NewsELA and Achieve 3000 to provide students with high interest texts on 
their Lexile reading level while increasing rigor and complexity periodically. Students' Lexile level is attained by using the 
Performance Series program, and students are tested three times a year, in September, January, and May, to monitor 
progress. The EDAT provides the school with data regarding students' at-risk level. Interventions are targeted at ELLs with 
disabilities, long term ELLs and SIFE, and ELLs who have an at-risk level of 5 or more according to the AMAO estimation tool. Of 
course, any student who is not progressing academically or performing well throughout the year is referred for AIS and 
possible further interventions. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

A recent trend at MS 104 has been an increase in the number of entering and emerging ELLs who are new to the country. 
These students require a significant amount of literacy instruction in order to develop the skills they need to succeed in the 
CCLS classroom, both academic and linguistically. For the upcoming year, MS 104 is considering grouping students so that ENL 
teachers and content teachers have more opportunities to collaborate and provide newcomer ELLs with more support and 
direct integrated instruction. We are also looking to align standalone ENL instruction more closely with the ELA content 
curriculum in order to help students develop the academic language they will need to complete grade-level tasks.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 
There are no programs for ELL students that will be discontinued.    
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 
ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs. Among the activities available after school include competitive sports 
teams, including basketball, tennis, volleyball, cheerleading, track, baseball and wrestling. Our other programs include 
ceramics, art club, drama, school newspaper, chess, book club, as well as a variety of clubs students may be interested in. Our 
after school program is managed by Manhattan Youth, and students may register online or in-person with a paper form. 
Information regarding these programs is sent home with all students in their parents' preferred language. These forms are also 
given to parents during the new ELL orientation provided for newcomer ELLs starting in the school for the first time. 
Interpreters and translators are provided both over the phone and in person for parents and students who need more 
explanation or support. Permission slips and informational brochures are provided in students' home languages and in English. 
 
 
Supplemental services for ELLs include the after-school ELL enrichment program, which provides students with additional 
literacy support as well as content area exploration in history and science. Field trips also provide students with authentic 
experiences that allow them to use English in real settings to discuss high-interest and relevant experiences. Trips include visits 
to museums, the public library, and workshops provided by non profit organizations. ENL teachers make extra efforts to ensure 
students participate in some kind of after school activity by mentioning them during 1-on-1 parent conferences and in letters 
home. MS 104 teachers value student interaction both during and after-school. All after-school activities are open to students, 
and translators are available to explain the program and its highlights to parents.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
At MS104, ELLs receive ELA instruction through integrated ENL/ELA, and math, science, and social studies teachers using ENL 
principles to inform their instruction. Teachers implement the NYS Next Generation Learning Standards using ENL strategies 
when planning their lessons, and classroom instruction reflects this accommodating support that also takes into consideration 
the NYS Learning Standards and the Bilingual Common Core Progressions. This approach makes it possible for the students to 
either be introduced or to further their linguistic and academic knowledge in English.  MS 104 teachers employ different 
strategies involving differentation, scaffolding, and interventions that support students' English language development and 
grade-level academic development. ENL teachers collaborate with content teachers, and make them aware of students' 
proficiency levels according to the most recent NYSESLAT or NYSITELL scores. Based on their proficiency levels as well as their 
academic performance, the teachers then develop individualized plans targeting their language and content development. 
Teacher teams create or modify instructional materials to support all ELLs including newcomers, Middle year ELLs, Long-term 
ELLs, Special Education ELLs, SIFE students, and Former ELLs. In class, this takes the form of leveled questions, writing scaffolds, 
differentiated text, and textual support such as glossaries and companion/supplemental texts and outlines. Small group 
instruction or one-on-one conferencing are often used to target specific content or literacy skills. Home language texts are 
used to support entering and emerging students in the grade-level classroom as well. In ENL/ELA, teachers use a variety of 
grade-level texts to focus classroom reading, writing, speaking and listening instruction. In all grades, teachers use a modified 
Teachers' College Reading and Writing Project, to facilitate student choice in reading and writing tasks. Students read grade-
level texts and complete writing activities to demonstrate their ability to write from sources. Classroom instruction also 
includes discussions in the form of pair-shares, literature circles, and whole-class Socratic seminars. In ELA, classroom 
instruction involves the principles included in the "Scaffolding Instruction for English Language Learners: A Resource Guide for 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

English Language Arts" document provided by EngageNY. Teachers scaffold instruction specific to students' needs. In all 
subject areas, 104 ensures all students have the same access and interaction with grade-level texts. Instruction is based on 
mainly two approaches: First, using principles outlined in the sample Common Core-aligned units from the American Institute 
for Research, teachers use protocols that ensure tasks and texts are appropriately scaffolded for students. Instruction involves 
previewing an activating prior knowledge on a topic; focusing on and teaching essential Tier 2 and Tier 3 vocabulary (and Tier 1 
vocabulary if necessary); building and enhancing background knowledge; interacting with and participating in activities with 
appropriate supports in the form of word banks, glossaries, sentence starters and frames, graphic organizers, which allows 
students access to a variety of reading, writing, speaking and listening tasks; and then reviewing and summarizing instructional 
lessons and units. Second, teachers ensure all instruction is aligned with the research-based recommendations outlined in the 
"Teaching Academic Content and Literacy to English Learners in Elementary and Middle School" published by What Works 
Clearinghouse in 2014. Teachers teach academic vocabulary words intensively across several days, integrate oral and written 
English language instruction into teaching, and provide regular structured opportunities to develop written skills. Math 
teachers in particular also use the "Scaffolding Instruction for English Language Learners: A Resource Guide for Mathematics" 
document as guiding document for supporting ELLs in the math classroom. Teachers strategically use technology to support 
ELLs' learning across the content areas through targeted instruction. For students who struggle with reading, iPads and iPod 
touches allow them to receive audio support either with online texts or eBooks. Online programs such as Achieve3000, 
Newsela, Imagine Learning, and Learning Ally also allow students to access grade-level content that is differentiated for their 
reading level but increases in difficulty as students progress through the program. Teachers regularly use Google Apps such as 
Google Translate and Google Docs to allow newcomer students who need the support to write in their home language and 
then translate their thoughts and ideas into English. This allows entering students to engage cognitively with academic tasks 
and develop their English skills as they become more proficient. During standalone ENL instruction, ENL teachers use the 
NYCDOE Common Core-aligned Units for Beginning ELLs: Families, Schools and Communities; Challenges and Solutions; and 
Human Migration. Every week students participate in reading, writing, listening, and speaking tasks meant to build their 
English skills in academic settings. For SIFE students, we use the NYCDOE and NYSED resources for SIFE instruction in ELA. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

 Our ELL students receive native language support in a variety of ways. We provide students with learning opportunities that 
make clear links between students' background knowledge and new concepts. This is done through a systematic vocabulary 
study that capitalizes on cognates (where applicable) and language/academic skill transfer. Native language materials such as 
bilingual dictionaries, glossaries, and translation tools are also provided across the curriculum. Home language support is 
assessed in the ENL program model as students develop their literacy in English and their home language.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

At the beginning of the year, ENL teachers use ATS to obtain reports on students' proficiency levels as well as special education 
designations. This data is reviewed by teachers, administrators, and guidance counselors to determine the most appropriate 
classroom placements. Students are then programmed based on the new CR part 154 regulations, which stipulate the 
minimum number of hours students should receive integrated ENL instruction as well as standalone ENL instruction. As 
students are programmed, ENL teachers double-check that students are in the appropriate setting for their age, grade level, 
ENL, and special education needs. For instance, all ELLs receive 1 unit of integrated ENL/ELA, and entering and emerging ELLs 
receive 1 unit of standalone ENL. Students receive standalone ENL in a single-grade class, or a mixed class with students from 
no more than 2 contiguous grades. Students with disabilities receive integrated ENL in their appropriate setting, including ICT, 
SETSS, or self-contained classrooms.For ELL-SWDs, services and resources are adapted through a collaborative effort between 
special education teachers/service providers and ENL teachers. Grade-level is scaffolded as necessary as per the students' 
cognitive needs as indicated on their IEP and the most recent formative evaluations of students' cognitive, linguistic, and 
academic performance.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our school does not share a building with another school. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

  
Students who are identified as new before the beginning of school are invited to tour the school during the summer months. A 
student buddy (from the same country) is identified if possible so that the student has someone to connect with from the first 
day.  Parents and guardians are made aware of interpretation services if needed. 
 
On the first day of school, 6th grade teachers go on a school walk to familiarize the students with school personnel and 
location of points of interest in the school. This is conducted by homeroom teachers, guidance counselors, and administrators. 
Students have access to interpreters as needed, according to their proficiency needs. All guidance counselors are available for 
at-risk counseling as needed. 
 
New students who enroll throughout the year participate in the parent orientation to learn about the ENL program offered at 
MS 104. In addition, the ENL teachers provide students with a tour of the school, a list of their classroom teachers and contact 
information, their schedule, as well as pertinent information for high school or upcoming events and assessments. Students 
are invited to join the after school enrichment program through Manhattan Youth and the ELL enrichment program. Both 
provide opportunities for students to develop their social and academic skills, and allow them to interact with their peers. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

MS 104 offers ELL students opportunities to take language electives in Spanish or French.   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Our school does not have a dual language program.  
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 
The goal of staff development at MS104 is to increase student achievement and engagement. By providing the school 
personnel with learning opportunities on the latest research, MS104 is investing in our school quality. We have 80 minutes of 
professional development every Monday after school, as well as, 35 minutes of professional time before school on 
Wednesdays. Our school administration, teachers, guidance counselors, psychologists, speech therapists, parent coordinator 
and paraprofessionals are strongly encouraged to attend DOE workshops, NYS Learning Standards and Danielson's Framework 
training sessions, TESOL conferences and Teacher's College training sessions. Through these programs, they learn how to 
better differentiate instruction, adapt curriculums and effectively assess the ELL students. In addition, the ESL team attends 
conferences and workshops provided by the Office of English Language Learners. Our ESL coordinators also facilitate in-house 
workshops so teachers can better understand the process of second language acquisition and ways to better assist their ELL 
students in mainstream classrooms. This may include Professional Learning Opportunities focused on academic language, 
sheltering instruction, and other topics. Our ENL coordinators have also facilitated professional book study groups guiding staff 
members through protocols to enhance discussion and thinking.To reach the goal of helping ELLs meet the NYS Learning 
Standards, teachers are working together to implement NYSLS-aligned curriculum as they learn how to prepare Understanding 
by Design lessons with UDL strategies. The goal is to make sure that ELL students are exposed to instructional resources that 
are aligned and at the same time accessible to them. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

Throughout the year, MS 104 utilizes both in-school professional development time and out of school professional learning 
opportunities to engage in professional development. We attend and participate in PDs led by the Department of ELLs and 
Student Services, as well as NYSRBERN, the Manhattan Field Support Center, and other organizations. Topics include: 
 
- Utilizing the EDAT, ATS (MFSC 9/11) 
- Co-teaching and Collaboration (NYSRBERN 9/27) 
- Meeting CR part 154 requirements (MFSC 10/6) 
- Effective Instruction for ELLs (UFT ELLevating Conference 10/14) 
- ELL Leads workshop and Compliance series (MFSC 9/19, 10/19, 11/28, 1/17, 3/8) 
- Academic Conversations (DELLSS 11/6) 
- Academic Vocabulary for Middle School Social Studies Institute (DELLSS 11/13, 11/14, 12/12, 1/18) 
- ELL students with disabilities  
- ELL Advanced literacy (MFSC 11/7, 2/7) 
- Supporting newcomer ELLs (TBA) 
- Supporting long-term ELLs (TBA) 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
  
Teachers are required to participate in at least 100 hours of Continuing Teacher & Leader Education (CTLE) every 5 years. This 
amounts to at least 3 hours of annual ELL-specific professional development for all teachers (15%), and 10 hours of annual ELL-
specific professional development for ENL/bilingual education teachers (50%). 
 
At MS 104, all teachers participate in either an in-school PD session or an outside PD opportunity led by an approved provider 
in order to meet the required CTLE requirements. All teachers are invited to professional learning opportunities for ELL-specific 
topics that will help grow teacher practice and methodology to adapt content for all learners. These PDs are ELL-specific and 
documented in teachers' files and school record-keeping. Attendance is taken and verified with agendas   
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Our ENL teachers schedule individual conferences with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language development 
progress, language proficiency assessment results and language development needs in the content areas. Our parent 
coordinator, Blanca Rivera arranges for DOE translators from the Translation and Interpretation Unit to come to our building 
during these conferences when needed or we utilize the DOE's over-the-phone translation services. Additionally, Bradley 
Donaldson (ENL coordinator) speaks Spanish. In addition to individual meetings, we do also hold two annual parent meetings 
for parents of ELLs to inform them about statewide exams including the NYSESLAT, how to best prepare for these exams and 
what happens after their child takes the exam. Ms. Rivera ensures translators are requested in a timely manner and present at 
the time of the meeting.  

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

 Our ELL parents attend parent teacher conferences and Back to School Night, in addition to individually scheduled meetings 
with the ENL teachers. Furthermore, we host workshops provided by the ENL coordinators specifically for parents of ELL 
students such as Google Classroom and Skedula use (October) and a NYSESLAT/statewide exam informational meeting 
(March). Parents are also invited to participate with the Parent Teacher Association and chaperon school dances, assist at 
fundraising events, the school play, and sporting events, and participate on the school leadership team. The parent

coordinator is integral in contacting and updating parents with calendars, email newsletters, school website updates, and 
letters home (all translated in parents' preferred language as needed). The parent coordinator, Blanca Rivera, also arranges 
over-the-phone translation for teachers during the school day, and works with the Translation and Interpretation unit to 
request interpreters for events such as parent teacher conferences, back to school night, and individually scheduled meetings 
with ENL teachers.  
All parents of ELLs are also invited to city-wide ELL conferences to support student college and career readiness 
(NYSRBERN NYU 10/24).

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Rocco Macri, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

School personnel, including the pupil accounting secretary and the school's ENL teachers, collect data about 
parents' language preferences upon their child's enrollment in the school. This information is compiled into an 
electronic document on Google Drive that is shared with all members of staff. For existing students or incoming 6 
th graders, this information is collected based on student emergency cards, and organized by grade and class. The 
Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) is also completed and stored in students' cumulative records, and 
include information on parents' preferred languages.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A. 
 

 

 
 
Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services 
 
1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be 

distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.  
 

Document Name  

Month/Frequency Distributed to 

How do you plan to translate? 

Families  

Include procedures to ensure timely 
provision of translated documents 

 

to parents.  

 

The school distributes documents such 
as DOE parent guides and handbooks, 
parent newsletters, school calendars, 
announcements from school 
leadership, and information regarding 
pertinent school information. These 
are usually distributed to students well 
in advance of the corresponding events 
throughout the year. Documents are 
prepared and sent to the Language 
Access Coordinator, Blanca Rivera, at 
least two weeks in advance of the 
critical deadline or event so that 
translation services may be ordered 
through the Language and 
Interpretation Unit.  

Approximate dates for the 
dissemination of parent-facing 
documents are:

Parents who do not speak English are presented with the Language ID guide and receive the requested services. A 
welcome poster as well as the Parents' Bill of Rights is posted in the available languages, and parents are also given

group of parents from the diverse cultures and languages represented at MS 104 will also be established in January to 
gather feedback and best practices on Translation and Interpretation.
