Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

 

 

The mission for PS 251 is to promote student engagement by collaboratively designing comprehensive units of study, 
and lesson plans that provide rigorous tasks and activities to suit our diverse set of learners. Assessment data will be 
utilized in alignment with instruction in order to modify our practices and maximize student-learning outcomes. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

Through our teacher teams, we will analyze student work to maintain alignment between our intended outcomes and 
actual student learning. We will then address the learning gaps by adjusting our instruction to meet student needs 
identified by qualitative and quantitative data. Our school community will develop the habits of prioritizing, reflecting, 
and refining our practices to enhance our learning. We will ensure that we experience success in academics, as well as 
in our ability to productively contribute to our community.  

 

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Public School 251 is tandem to MS 355 and MS 356, located in Springfield Gardens, a section of South Eastern 
Queens, New York. As of September 2016, we became an extended elementary school with two classes per grade for 
Pre-K to 5th. We recently had our first fifth grade graduating class in June 2017. It was an exciting time for our 
students, staff and parents. We also continued our expansion celebration by recreating our school logo from 
"Nurturing Each Child for Maximum Success" to "Leaders Today, Leaders Tomorrow" to further represent our vision 
and goal for our students.  

 

In 2018-2019, P.S. 251Q will be serving a population of approximately 350 students, most of which reside in 
communities across the Queens District 29 community, and are predominantly of African descent. Less than 1% of our 
population is English Language Learners and about 20% are Students with Disabilities. 

 

Partnerships for school improvement will be established through The Borough Field Support Center- for operations 
and professional development; District 29 Teachers College Writing Initiative, and professional support from our 
selected publishers such as Pearson and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt from whom we purchase curriculum materials- 
Math, Literacy and Science. We have recently purchased the program Passport for Social Studies to replace the 
Harcourt Social Studies Program that we used over the past seven years. 

 

Established Partnerships for parent and student support include:  

 

● PEARLS Mentoring Program for female students in Grades 3-5, which is facilitated by female teachers  

● The Roy Wilkins Recreational Center and NYC Parks Department: Swim for Life program for Grade 2 students 

● Reading Empowers- a Saturday volunteer run reading enrichment program for K – 3 students 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

● PBIS: Monthly assemblies are conducted based upon the Six Pillars of Character Traits. Student of the Month and 
Class of the Month are selected, as well as acknowledging staff members that have continuously PBIS throughout the 
building. 

● Brain Power: Students will be able to utilize mediation and focusing techniques in the classrooms.  

● Student Council: Our Fourth and Fifth Grade students select elected peers to serve on the council to help determine 
school policy and provide community service.  

● Journey's Across Cultures: Grades are assigned various cultures throughout the world to study, and provide a 
cumulative event where the students present their findings to parents.  

● KJK After School Program- providing after school care for students (Homework, Robotics, Dance, and other 
enrichment activities) from 2:20 PM – 6:00 PM.  

 

Our faculty is committed to providing standards based instruction through best practices. Our professional practice is 
guided by the Principles of Learning for Effort-based Education and Charlotte Danielson’s Framework for Teaching. 
The school’s curriculum is based on the New York State Common Core State Standards (CCSS)/New York City Common 
Core Learning Standards (CCLS), which determine the essential content and skills for each grade level. Curriculum 
Units for teaching and learning are developed from curriculum support materials that are aligned with these 
standards and the State/City Scope and Sequence.  

 

The core curriculum is supported by an enrichment program that taps into students’ interests and talents. The core 
curriculum subjects are English Language Arts/Literacy- which is integrated into all curricular areas, Mathematics, 
Science, and Social Studies. The enrichment subjects are: Health, Physical Education, and Music (vocal and 
instrumental). 

 

Performing Arts form the basis for school wide activities and events such as Assembly Programs, a Winter Holiday 
Show, Black History Month Show, Moving-Up Ceremonies, and other special occasions. The Arts are also integrated in 
content areas or accessed through class trips and Move-to Improve activities. In 2015-2016 our school became a 
Move-to-Improve Champion School and became of 50 leading elementary schools to jump start physical education 
(PE) by adding a certified PE teacher, who often worked alongside our dedicated common branch elementary PE 
teachers, as part of the PE Works initiative.  

 

The implementation of classroom Instruction includes multiple approaches and differentiated strategies, based on 
current student data. For example, teachers use formative assessment data in order to identify appropriate entry 
points to support student learning gaps. Teachers also provide Tier I intervention by grouping students for 
differentiated instruction. The impact of teaching places the focus on student led outcomes, which fosters 
independence, competence, and student success. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

20% of our students are special education. Their specific needs are learning disables, speech and language impaired, 
and emotional disturbance. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

During the last school year 2017-2018, our school made the most progress in Rigorous Instruction. We are going to

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Based upon our NYSED state data, in 2016-2017 we decreased 4% overall in our ELA performance across grades 3-5. 
This is our third year utilizing Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's Journey's program. Teachers have communicated that they 
had more success with the program this year with Journey's based upon familiarity, and training with the curriculum. 
One drawback of Journey's is that the skills - although addressed across the curriculum - are taught discreetly. 
Teacher feedback has been that in order to support students effectively, we need a more direct curriculum for 
students. Our priority needs is to provide PLCs that focus on addressing the skills needed to support student 
understanding and increase comprehension.  

 

In terms of writing data, based on our Teacher's College Pre and Post assessments student growth was tracked as 
followed: 

 

 

● Overall, as a school community, we initially had our lowest rated area of writing in conventions; however, through 
data-driven instruction, that area has improved to no longer being in the bottom third.  

● Kindergarten: Both classes improved by 6% overall in structure and conventions of writing throughout the year. 
● Second Grade: Both classes improved by 7% overall in structure, development, and conventions in writing 
throughout the year. 
● Third Grade: Classes improved by 17% overall in structure and conventions in writing throughout the year. 
● Fourth Grade: Both classes improved by 5% overall in development in writing. 
● Fifth Grade: Both classes improved by 12% overall in structure, particularly in elaboration and craft. 

 

For our RTI support, teachers are using Fundations and Wilson. We will also be using Performance Series to assess and 
progress monitor our tiered students for evidence of growth and mastery.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
Goal 1-Rigorous Instruction-By June 2019, 85% of all teachers will provide students with tasks and activities that 
demonstrate intellectual engagement which will result in a 10% decrease in developing ratings in Domain 3 as evidenced 
by the Danielson Framework for teaching rubric data collected in Advance.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Our school has established both the Pillars of Character (from Character Counts) together with PBIS (Positive Behavior 
Intervention System) that we re-launched in February as the driving force for classroom and school culture, where 
students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

 
We had initially re-launched PBIS due to the inconsistencies of expectations noticed throughout the building. The staff 
then determined expectations for the different parts of the school building – i.e., hallways, bathrooms, classrooms, 
etc. The school community was then trained collaboratively to create a common language for the students. Each class 
had a scheduled opportunity to then tour the building to learn about the new expectations of the school. We then 
aligned our expectations to the school character traits.  

 
Some examples of the common language utilized for gaining students' attention include "Give me five” and “Show me 
five.” We also correct inappropriate behaviors incorporating the same language and incorporate a common 
disciplinary approach. This includes language for self-reflection and motivation - “remember to make good choices” 
and “use your walking feet,” along with a tiered reward system leading up to the a monthly PBIS assembly when 
students and staff wear their PBIS T-shirt and attend an assembly focused on one of the Pillar of Character Traits. We 
then announce the Student and Class of the Month based upon their demonstration of instilling their monthly 
character trait. The Students of the Month’s pictures are placed on the “PBIS Tree” where they demonstrate how they 
embodied their character trait for that particular month. We believe that this practice reinforces academic 
achievement, responsibility, and citizenship throughout the building. By the end of of the 2016-2017 school year, we 
noticed a 67% decrease in our OORS reports. Our assemblies are now run by the PBIS team, which compromises of 8 
teachers and the assistant principal.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, all teachers will utilize the components of PBIS in order to increase the percentage of students 
exhibiting positive behaviors with 4th and 5th grade specifically. The school will engage in 1 assembly per month to 
continue to create accountability structures for students in order to increase positive behavior and decreases OORS 
report data for grades 4 and 5 by 20% and school-wide by 25%.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Over the past three years our school has been fostering teacher collaboration through the daily programming that 
includes common preps for grade planning at least twice a week for every grade level. On Mondays, the staff receives 
extended professional development that has a specific focus through Professional Learning Cycles in order to further 
expand on key concepts as a vertical and grade teams. On Tuesdays, grade level teams also rotate to have a data 
meeting with administration to explore student work, discuss instructional practices utilized, and to determine 
appropriate next steps.  

 

Our strength in collaboration has accounted for grade alignment of curriculum and instruction and facilitated 
discussion of student data to identify student strengths and areas of focus in relation to grade to grade expectations. 
As a result, increased student achievement in our school can be credited largely to teacher collaboration around 
instructional planning.  

 

Although we have been engaging in teacher team work, we believe that our students can be elevated to higher levels 
of success if we raise the bar for intellectual engagement. The 2017-2018 teacher observation report reflect and 
ongoing conversation in this area of the Danielson Framework. 

Our priority, therefore, is to identify a goal that targets an area where we can effectively engage teachers teams in 
order to build capacity around lesson planning to improve instruction and student achievement.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of teachers will be active participants in at least 2 professional learning cycles with a focus on using 
data to adjust instructional decisions and using student work to inform next steps for instructional practices resulting in 
an increase of 10% in reading performance as evidenced by Journey's pre and post assessments, and a 10% increase in 
math assessments from the Beginning of Year to End of Year assessments.

focused on.  

Instructional team members will guide the work of teacher 
teams to state a common goal and use the goal to develop 
teaching points that will be used in alignment with shifts in 
instructional practices and student work will be used to 
determine next steps for instructional practices.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

During the last school year, teacher ratings on component 3c was an area of improvement. During the end year 
conversations with teachers, teachers communicated that they needed clarification of component 3c and what 
engagement looks like in practice. Teachers also requested additional PD in 3C, specifically rigorous instruction and 
the evidence of rigor in planning and practice.  

The Principal's Performance Observation (PPO) from 2017-2018 communicated that there was an inconsistent pattern 
of multiple entry points for students and SWD's. It was noted during the PPO that students were more compliant than 
engaged. This data will be utilized in our teacher development professional learning cycles to support teacher practice 
in engaging students in appropriate leveled tasks, and improving student learning outcomes. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, school leaders will create and implement a professional development plan that builds teacher' capacity to 
select or design activities and assignments that challenge students to think deeply and explain their thinking as 
measured by a 10% increase in observation ratings of effective/highly effective on component 3c of the Danielson 
Framework for Teaching Rubric, Engaging Students in Learning.

Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Our NYC school survey stated that approximately 78% of the parents felt welcomed in our school community. In order 
to continue to maintain parent involvement the school hosted three activities to support the link between instruction, 
supportive environment, and family-community ties. These events were successful in that 80% of our parents 
attended to support our school community. Many classes engaged in the cumulative activities to consolidate student 
learning.  

Our priority is to continue to improve on structures that would result in staff working closely with parents and the 
community by extending learning activities beyond the walls of the classroom.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, families will be presented with an interest survey in order to determine the barriers to attending school 
events. The school community will address one piece of feedback from the survey to increase parent involvement and 
the participation of parents and children in extended learning activities, which will result in 80% of students 
participating in the school and district History and Science fairs, and Career Day.

Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS 

 

1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your 
school. (Please note that your current STH population may not be the same as officially reported in DOE 
systems and may change over the course of the year.)

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP) Template  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S 251 Queens, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the 
Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Parental Involvement and School Quality

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress; 

● providing school folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, and to the 
extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand. 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

P.S. 251Q will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
1.     Pearson’s Developmental Reading Assessment (DRA2) is the tool used school wide to assess the early literacy skills of all 
students, including English Language Learners. In Kindergarten, the Wilson Fundation Pre Assessment is administered in 
October and DRA2 is administered in January, March and June.  The Wilson assessment presents data on the students’ 
performance levels in early literacy skills, such as letter and sound recognition, phonemic awareness, and sight word 
recognition. The DRA2 presents data on students’ reading levels and captures a picture of where students are compared to 
where they need to be according to PS 251Q established benchmarks. Both assessments present insights into what targeted 
areas of the literacy continuum are affecting the students’ performance in Reading.  Potential ELL students are also 
administered the NYSITELL to determine their proficiency level in ELA.

Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], 

homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

        The ENL/ESL program is done both in Standalone/pull out  and Intergrated/push in.  The ELL students based on the language proficiency  on the NYSITELL or NYSELAT receive 360 minutes or 180 minutes per week.  The ELL students that receive 360 minutes receive both 180 minutes of standalone ENL, and 180 minutes of integrated 
ENL/Content Area.  The ELL students  who receive 180 minutes ,receive both Stand alone and Integrated ENL/Content Area time .  The students who have Stand alone work in heterogeneous small groups and sometimes in pairs. They travel together as a group. At the present time, PS 251Q does not have any ELL or ENL 
students.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 below)? 

              The school administrator and ENL teacher review the program model (ELL Policy and Reference Guide) and the RLAT list and devise a schedule in order to ensure that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided to ELLs.  According to the program model, The Entering and Emerging ELLs must receive 180 minutes of Stand 
alone ENL, and 90/180 minutes of Integrated ENL/Content Area.  The Transitioning or Expanding ELLs can receive90/180 minutes of both Stand alone and integrated ENL,Content Area.  The ELLS who become proficient receive 2 years of 90 minute Integrated ENL in ELA/ Content Area.  
At the present time, PS 251Q does not have any ENL or ELL students.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards.  

      In the Stand alone program model, the ELLs are using grade level textbooks and workbooks that cater to both their academic and language proficiency needs and The common core learning standards . In the Integrated ENL/ Content Area program model, the ENL teacher co teaches with the classroom teacher(ELA, Science, math, and social 
studies) using the grade curriculum materials which adheres to the Common Core Learning Standards. The materials used are ELL component in Journeys, Envisions Math, and Fundations. 
   
At the present time, PS 251Q does not have any ENL or ELL students.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

       The Spanish LAB,  State Science and Math exams ensure that ELLs are evaluated in their home languages throughout the year.   
 
At the present time, PS 251Q does not have any ENL or ELL students.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

       When we have SIFE students, based on the questionnaire and the LENS,  we see the student's academic deficiencies and give them targeted instruction.  The SIFE students receive extra academic support duing AIS and RTI. 
        For the newcomer ELL students who have been in the US for 0-3 years, during Stand alone ENL, classroom literacy block, and AIS, students utilize big books, do shared reading and guided reading, complete phonics activities, picture cards, teachermade learning aids, and lap tops- integrating technology and basic ELA skills that help to build 
the foundation of English language acquisition. We also use starfall, abcmouse, and  other computer programs to strengthen phonemic awareness and reading comprehension skills. 
        For the low Intermediate  and Intermediate ELLs their progress is carefully monitered and assessed. The ENL teacher spends a great deal of time reviewing and practicing skills that are assessed both on the NYSELAT and NYS ELA exam. Such skills include reading comprehension, main idea, grammar, listening, speaking, and writing.  Also the 
classroom teacher uses graphic organizers, note-taking, pre-writing, and self editing.  Teachers collaboratively reflect on our practices and look at student data to inform instructional decisions for rigor. 
        For the Long Term ELLs , both the classroom teacher and the ENL teacher continue to do classroom assessments, periodic and state exams to see their academic deficiencies. We then give them targeted instruction in ELA  skills or Math.  We continue to give them additional support during AIS and RTI. 
        The former ELLS  continue to receive 90 minutes of Integrated instruction in ELA and other content areas for two years.  Also, they continue to receive Academic Intervention Services in the needed skill.    
 
At the present time, PS 251Q does not have any ELL or ENL students.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic content areas and accelerate English language development?  

        ELL-SWDs receive instruction based on their IEPs and goals.  Instruction of ELLs with IEPs are discussed on a regular basis with classroom teachers, speech pathologist, and occupational/ physical therapists. We use grade level textbooks and workbooks in language arts, SS, science, and math that have rich vocabulary, and emphasize on prior 
knowledge and multisensory activities.  Technology programs such as starfall, razkids, and activityworks(bi-lingual) , and other  computer programs are used. Also both classroom teachers and ENL teacher meet and co-plan, while using frayer model graphic organizers to help in vocabulary development skills.  Both classroon and ENL teacher has 
native language fiction and non-fiction books  to support native language skills.  The Common Core  materials used by both classroom and ENL teachers help accelerate English language acquisition. 
 
At the present time, PS 251Q does not have any ELL or ENL students.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 

        Instruction for ELLs is targeted to their learning needs within a general education classroom and through the ELL free standing program services. Differentiation, rephrasing/reframing questions, allow students the ability to think critically while working at their independent levels. When ELL students show inadequate progress in the regular 
setting, the school increases access to educational supports while retaining the student in the least restrictive environment. Consideration for type of srvices hinge on factors such as: the number of years of instruction in an ENL program; English and home language literacy; content area and socio-emotional support needs of students with 
inconsistent/interrupted formal education (SIFE); English and home language literacy needs of long-term ELLs; results on the annual English Language proficiency assessment exam; content area and teacher recommendation; parent or guardian request; and student work samples in English. Similarities between Learning Disability and Language 
Acquisition behaviors are also considered. If there is an integrated co-teaching class on the grade, the ELL student would be placed in an ICT class with continued ELL sevices. If progress is not adequate, a referral is made for special education testing.  Following this step, the student’s intervention plans are re-aligned to recommended or required 
plans. In this way, the school implements curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs within the least restrictive environment.   
 
At the present time, PS 251Q does not have any ELL or ENL students. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which they are offered. 

Based on NYSITELL/Spanish LAB and classroom data we target ELL students by addressing their needs in small group instruction or individual conferences, and we provide Integrated ENL/ ESL services which integrate literacy and content area instruction,  specific to the students' assessed needs.  Native Language support is also incorporated as 
necessary. Grades 2 and 3 student are also mandated for small group instruction, and Grade 3 students are offered Success Academy afterschool 2 days a week in preparation for the New York State Test. Based on performance data, we offer pull out Tier 2 transitional support for students who have tested out of ENL/ESL. 
 
At the present time, PS 251Q does not have any ELL or ENL students.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

In the coming year we will utilize the ELL component of Journeys, the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Literacy Program in use by the entire school, as well as infuse more technology in ESL instruction.  
 
At the present time, PS 251Q does not have any ELL or ENL students.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?

Importance of Cultural Assimilation, Tolerance and Understanding of Different Cultures and Customs, The Necessity of 
Academic Language, The Purpose of Functional Language, Aligning Academic Writing with ESL Standards, Identifying 
Mathematic Academic Language for Saliency, and Differentiating Instruction for ELL’s.  In order to support our ELL's transition 
from our elementary school to another school we conduct orientation workshops for parents to familiarize them with the 
programs and expectations of upper grades and other schools. The school secretary and Parent Coordinar also receive 
professional development on communicating with Ell students and parents.. 
The ENL teacher has access to a menu of ongoing city and district wide professional development offerings, in addition to #1

1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.

choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

We collect language data from parents as part of the registration process. Each parent completes a Home 
Language survey (HLIS), and a Student Emergency Contact card, where they indicate the preferred language for 
communication. Translation/Assistance is provided as needed. The school secretary enters the relevant data in 
ATS and provides it to the ELL teacher, who then meets with the incoming parents. In this way we are able to 
determine whether ELL families would greatly benefit from both written and oral translations. We record their 
needs and preferences, with the aid of school based or parent volunteer translators, and our parent coordinator 
ensures that all services are rendered in a timely fashion. As a school, we recognize that oral and written 
translations are helpful in order to ensure full comprehension and communication. However, for 2015 - 2016, we 
currently have no non English speaking parents/no requests for oral or written translation. Usually, pertinent 
members of the school community- educators, educational assistants, guidance counselor, social worker, 
psychologists, occupational and physical therapists, speech therapist, secretaries, and the parent coordinator are

made aware of oral or written translation needs of ELL households. They are also provided with the names of the 
school based and parent volunteer translators who could be called upon for assistance.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

Using DOE translation services and utilize staff members that speak same language.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

School will provide Professional Development to review the regulation 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

In compliance with the Chancellor Regulation A-663 all students who speak another language at home are identified 
within the first ten days of their enrollment. If the family needs written or oral  

translations they are provided immediately in order to “provide such families with a meaningful opportunity to 
participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education”.
