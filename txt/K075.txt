Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our mission is to empower students into becoming independent thinkers and problem solvers who are able to make 
wise, responsible decisions while incorporating their learning experiences and learning styles in pursuit of academic 
and social success. We will work collaboratively to develop a community of accountability among faculty, families, and 
students in order to create a safe, learning environment which promotes academic rigor. We support students by 
providing them with academic and social experiences that enhance their individual abilities as they become 
productive citizens in a global, technological society.

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The Mayda Cortiella/PS 75 School is located in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. We have a total of 305 students 
enrolled. 17.05% of our students are English Language Learners. Our Special Education Population consists of 23.93% 
students with IEPs. 12.33% of the students receive related services; 38.36% receive instruction in an integrated Co-
Teaching (ICT) classroom; 36.99% receive instruction in the most restrictive environment. 

 

We have collaborated with The Department of Sanitation and our students continue to engage in activities and learn 
about sustainability. To ensure that all students are prepared to make wise, responsible decisions, we implemented 
the Core Virtues Program. Each month, students are highlighted for showing the virtue of the month. Parents are 
invited to a ceremony in which the students receive an award for their accomplishments.  

The Mayda Cortiella/PS 75 School community is in good standing. We have an inclusive culture and our instructional 
goals meet all academic, social, and emotional needs of students. The curricula are aligned to the Common Core 
Standards and teachers are supported through feedback using the Danielson Framework. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

14.96% of our student population are English Language Learners (ENLs). Our ENL Students struggle with language 
acquisition and academic vocabulary. Our students with disabilities (SWD) struggle in the area of comprehension and 
writing, focusing primarily in the area of vocabulary as evidenced by running records and writing samples.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

As a school community we are making progress in the Framework for Great Schools: Collaborative Teachers. MOTP 
for 2017-2018 showed that 88% of teachers were effective. We will continue working on the framework element- 
Effective School Leadership to build teacher capacity as a means of improving teaching and learning.  

We have been successful in the Framework for Great Schools: Strong Family and Community Ties with our Superman 
Program. The fathers engage in monthly workshops with their child(ren). We were fortunate to have District Attorney, 
Eric Gonzalez attend a session. The Superman Program was initiated at PS 75 as a follow up to the Million Father 
March. The fathers and students have engaged in the Cookshop Program. Allowing our partners to prepared healthy 
snacks with the students. We will continue to provide meaningful workshops as a means of strengthening the 
framework element-Strong Family and Community Ties.  

After analyzing data from our June 2018 Instructional Report, we identified a common trend across testing grades. 
Based on the data our students were deficient in CCLS RL.5 for both Literature and Informational Text. We will 
continue to use research based strategies to address this deficiency. 

According to the Danielson Framework, 50.91% of teachers were developing in the area of questioning and 
discussion. Due to our need to focus on questioning and discussion, we will provide professional learning to support 
teachers as a means of empowering our students as they develop, answer questions and engage in meaningful 
discussions. 

Data from our 2018 Instructional Report, we are currently below the city in mathematics: Grade 3: 16%, Grade 4: 29%, 
and Grade 5: 23%. We have identified the areas of focus: Problem solving in which teachers will engage in 
collaborative work to support our students.  

We have implemented programs: 100% attendance certificates, classes with highest percentage for the month 
receive an incentive; most improved student attendance receives an incentive as well. Illness is the major reason why 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

 

our student absence rates are high. This year we are going to target our chronically absent and severely chronically 
absent students. We will conduct conferences and try to address the needs of our students and their parents.

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
All students in grades K-2 will use The Wonders Program for ELA and grades K-5 use the ReadyGen Program for ELA. 
Grades K-5 will use the GoMath Program for mathematics. Both programs provide the Common Core Learning 
Standards for each lesson. Our students showed little progress for both NYS ELA and Mathematics Assessments and 
have not been successful in closing the achievement gap for our English Language Learners and Students with 
Disabilities.  

 

Our 2017-2018 NYS ELA Assessment Data for students with disabilities showed that 60% of our students are at level 
one and 26% are at level 2. Our students in grade 3 showed 53% are at Level on, 30% are at Level two, and 17% are at 
Leve three. Grade four showed: 60% are at level one and 20% are at level two. Our fifth grade showed 71% at level 
one. and 29% at Level two. This shows an increase of 5% compared to the 2016-2017 ELA Assessment Data. 

 

NYS ELA data showed 33% of our English Language Learners are at level one for grades 3-5 and 54% are at level two, 
and 4% are at Level three. Grade 3 showed 23% are at level 1 and 69% are at level 2. Grade 4 showed 12% at level 1, 
18% at level 2, and 5% at Level three. . Grade 5 showed that 75% of our students were at level 1 and 25% Our English 
Language learners showed a 5% increase compared to the 2016-2017 Assessment Data. 

 

61% of students with disabilities in grades 3-5 are at level one, 26% are at level 2, and 13% are at Level 3 In the area of 
mathematics, 

Grade three showed 7% are at level 1 and 3% are at level 2. Grade 4 showed 38% are at level one, 50% are at level 2, 
and 12% are at level 3. Grade 5 showed 85% at level 1 and 15% are at level 2.  

 

our English Language Learners of grades 3-5 have shown progress: 33% at level one and 54% at level two and 4% at 
level 3. Grade 3 showed 23% of our students are at level 1 and 69% are at level 2. Grade 4 showed that 28% are at 
level 1, 42% are at level 2, and 14% are at level 3. Grade five showed that 75% are at level 1 and 25% are at Level 2.

We have looked at student work including the Measure of Students Learning, MOSL administered in the Spring of 
2018 and found that our students have difficulty reading for long periods of time. Our focus this year will consist of 
reading for stamina and comprehension. 

Informed by Capacity Framework Element – Rigorous Instruction , current NYS data and student MOSL data, there is a 
need to improve our school-wide instructional focus in reading which will lead to improved student outcomes. This 
needs assessment informed the development of the annual goal listed below . 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 75% of students in grades K-5 will increase their reading proficiency by one level, as reflected in their 
performance on Fontas & Pinnell Reading Assessments and reading comprehension assessments aligned to the 
CCLS/Next Generation Standards.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
According to the School Quality Guide scoring Appendix, we at PS 75 scored 90% in the area of supportive 
environment on the School Survey. We take pride in ensuring that all students feel safe, supported, and challenged by 
their teachers.  

Opportunities for professional development sessions are provided and aligned to the school’s instructional goals. A 
full time English as a second language teacher provides instruction to English language learners at the beginner stage 
in a language rich and nurturing classroom setting. The second language acquisition teacher also pushes in to 
monolingual classes throughout the school day to meet the language needs of English language learners at various 
proficiency levels. Partnerships with organizations such as Department of Sanitation, Grow to Learn, and LEAP provide 
all our students with an opportunity to engage in extracurricular activities. Therefore, the effective use of available 
resources enhances the school’s efforts to improve student learning as noted in meaningful student work products 
such as realistic fiction and narrative writing artifacts in student folders and various research projects displayed on 
bulletin boards.  

The School Quality Guide Scoring Appendix did not display a score for student attendance 90% and above. Student 
attendance has been a concern for us. We have always provided incentives for students with 100% attendance. 
Looking at our attendance data we noticed a trend: Students who have absences in their early years of school 
continue to have absences throughout their educational journey. We decided that we will also focus on our students 
who are chronically absent and severely chronically absent.  

 

Informed by Capacity Framework Element – Supportive Environment , current data and our School Quality Guide 
Appendix, there is a need to improve our school-wide attendance in meeting individual student needs which will lead 
to improved student outcomes. This needs assessment informed the development of the annual goal listed below 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 5% of students who are chronically absent and severely chronically absent will decrease by 3% as 
measured by the RAMO Report in ATS.

Parent engagement is essential when addressing our student's education. In order to communicate the importance of 
parent participation in their child's education, it is imperative that parents become knowledgeable regarding their 
schools expectation and standards. The school culture must be inviting, supportive and approachable to parents. Daily 
expectations must be clear, concise, and transparent to parents; where student's daily attendance is viewed with high 
regards and where the students' academic demands as well as the established conduct norms are perceived as 
manageable and achievable. Due to the amount of ORRS incidence, parent participation in workshops are critical 
when addressing the Discipline Code in order to provide our students a safe, respectful and caring environment 
conducive towards preparing them for college and/or career readiness.  

Based on data gathered from PS 75: 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, the Quality Review rating for Strong Family - 
Community Ties fell within a quality indicator of 3.4 - High Expectation, with a rating of Developing. Informed by the 
Capacity Framework Elements- Supportive Environment and Strong Family and Community Ties on the school 
survey, the following percentages were identified as such: 87 % of families report that school staff regularly 
communicates with them about how families can help their child learn. 85 % of families report that they get 
opportunities to visit their child's classroom, such as observing instruction or participating in an activity with their 
child. 55 % of families report that they have had the opportunity to volunteer time to support their school. 89 % of 
families report that they have communicated with their child's teacher about their child's performance. These findings 
indicated that "the school leaders and staff are developing structures for helping families understand what is 
expected of students before they are labeled as struggling".  

Supporting evidence indicated that day to day communication with teachers and parent participation from the 
Tuesday afternoon conferences were instrumental in that teachers were able to share with parents their student's 
academic progress. However, "teachers and school leaders explained that the school provides the opportunities for 
families to learn about the demands of the Common Core, but theses meetings are not well attended."  

 

This needs assessment informed the development of the annual goal listed below. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, an extension of family ties and community-based partnerships will reinforce an environment where 
students feel safe, supported and valued. The increase of parent workshops, Family Fun Nights, and Read-Aloud 
Mornings, will show a 50% increase in attendance at family events and a 75% decrease in incidents reported in OORS, as

this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

The school will hold a Meet and Greet (parent-teacher ....) during 
the school year to build ties and develop relationships amongst 
parents and all members of the community. The Meet and Greet 
will include our families, our students, CBO's, staff members, the 
after school program and various members of the community 
encourage ways for parents to volunteer their time in clubs and 
projects for the school and community (IE.Gardening, Recycling 
projects). For example, the school will have presentations by 
RiseBoro, the Office of Student Enrollment and the Department 
of Housing Preservation & Development on assisting the needs of 
the community and finding resources. Additional 
workshops/presentations will be presented by school staff, 
community agencies and parent volunteers on policy and various 
resources available for supporting all students, including our ELL 
and Special Education population, and how to help them achieve 
at their highest levels. 

The school is working with the LEAP program to help develop 
more activities for students in the after school program, and 
provide extracurricular activities which will result in projects that 
will be presented and displayed to families and the community at 
a culminating event. 

 

 

Together with Grow to Learn we will have a Swap and Stop 
Saturday event. Teachers, parents and members of the 
community can bring clothes and items that they would like to 
share/drop off and take any items they can be used at home.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. The Mayda Cortiella/PS 75 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part 
A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy 
to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

[The Mayda Cortiella/PS 75] will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community. 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.

Begin description here:            
 Rationale: 
Student performance during the 2017-2018 school year assessment revealed the need to provide 
a Saturday program, for students presently in grade 3-5 receiving ESL services because of their 
performance on the MOSL.  They will be receiving instruction in English to help improve 
listening, speaking, reading, writing and mathematics.  The students need additional support to 
meet the Common Core Standards and acquire proficiency on the ELA, Math and NYSESLAT 
exams. The ENL Saturday program will consist of one second grade class, one third grade class, 
and one fourth grade class and one fifth grade class. Each class in grades 3-5 will 
10  students.  Grade 2 will service fifteen students. 
Teachers will use the Common Core Support Coach Reading Comprehension and Mathematics 
Program. Each class will have a licensed ENL Teacher. Students will receive two hours of ELA 
Instruction and two hours of Mathematics instruction.  
The program will begin in January 12, 2019 and end in April 13, 2019. The program will begin 
at 8:00 am and end at 12:00 pm. Students will receive two  hours of ENL Instruction and two 
hours of mathematics instruction. The Reading program will be used for ELA will target the five 
pillars of reading comprehension. The Mathematics program will include the common core 
standards. The program will begin in January 2019 and end April 2019. There will be a total of 
13 sessions. 
Subgroups and grades levels of students to be served: 
P.S. 75 did not meet the AYP requirements for the ELL subgroup.  Therefore, analyzing data of 
student’s performance including NYS ELA and Math scores, we find it necessary to provide an 
extended enrichment after school program for our students. 
Students in grades 3-5 who are struggling academically and were assessed at level 1 or 2 on the 
NYS ELA and Math will be able to receive enrichment services. Students in grade two who are 
struggling and were assessed using the MOSL and Fontas and Pinnell Running Records will be 
able to receive enrichment services.

Schedule and Duration: 
During the 2019 school year, PS 75K will implement an ELL Saturday Program. Teachers will 
receive a roster and attendance will be taken every Saturday on a monthly basis. The goal is to 
have twenty sessions for  one self-contained second grade class of 12 students. The program will 
be conducted from January, 2018 until April, 2019. Teachers will use a reading program as 
supplemental material for grade two. Teachers will use the balanced literacy model: 
Phonics/Word Work, Mini Lesson, Independent/Group Activity, and a Share. All students will 
be assessed and folders of student work will be provided.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
Language of Instruction:  
This is an ENL program and the language of instruction is English. We will focus on all four 
language skills-listening, speaking, reading and writing.  A major emphasis will be given to 
reading and writing.  Students will be conducting various activities through the five pillars of 
Literacy to meet the Common Core Learning Standards/Next Generation Standards and ENL 
Standards to improve their reading, writing, and mathematical skills. 
Number and Types of Certified Teachers: 
There will be 4 teachers certified in ENL. The Brooklyn North Borough Field 
Support Center  will assist with canvassing certified teachers for the Saturday Academy. 
Types of Materials: 
The Common Core Support Coach for grades 2-5 
The reading comprehension program is a program that is geared towards listening, speaking, 
reading, and writing skills.  The program addresses the content areas to meet the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  A major emphasis will be given to reading and writing. It provides the 
opportunity for students to receive a mini-lesson, guided practice and independent work. The 
plan will be repeated in 2019-2020. Each student will receive a folder that displays their 
independent work, assessments, and teacher comments. Teachers will receive a monthly 
attendance sheet with student names and numbers. Attendance will be taken every Saturday. 
Parents will be contacted by telephone for students who are absent. Parents will receive monthly 
notices about the program: sessions, time, curricula, and workshops. Notices to parents will be 
provided in both English and Spanish.

Professional Development is an integral part of our literacy, mathematics, and ENL development 
program at P.S. 75.  Our teachers are allotted eighty minutes on a weekly basis: Mondays for 
professional development. Teachers attend professional learning sessions from the Borough 
Field Support Specialists, Principal, colleagues, Assistant Principals and conferences. The 
Borough Field Support Specialists are providing several professional learning series for ENL 
teachers and assistant principals: One session a month. This form of professional learning will be 
of no cost. 
Educators must keep abreast of the important advances that are occurring in education.  This is 
where professional development comes in.  Professional development is defined as “the process 
of improving staff skills and competencies needed to produce outstanding educational results for 
students” (Hassel, 1999) As Thomas Guskey (2000, p.4) states, “One constant finding in the 
research literature is that notable improvements in education almost never takes place in the 
absence of professional development.” 
Based on the data, pre/post assessments and observations, professional development topics 
include: Reading comprehension, content-based vocabulary, Writer's workshop,  differentiated

instruction, how to create multiple entry points, tiered lessons and higher order 
thinking questions using stem starters to assist with  peer discussions. The professional learning 
will allow teachers to provide a variety of scaffolds to ensure ENL Students have access to the 
curricula. 
 
School systems today are charged with addressing ever-increasing demands: reducing the 
achievement gap, adopting evidence-based practices, meeting adequate yearly progress goals, 
managing the requirement of second-language an special-needs students, and remaining current 
on the increasing amount of pedagogical and content areas research. 
 
Ms. Franco and Ms. Sosa-Ramos will receive professional learning at PS 75 and the Brooklyn 
North Field Support Center. Topics include: 
1. Nuts and Bolts of creating ELL Programs 
2. Language impact on writing 
3. Needs assessment based on MOSL Data 
4. Writing on demand 
5. Co-teaching for ENL students. 
6. Scaffolds to support ENL students 
7. Reading comprehension for ENL Students 
8. Planning lessons to support ENL students 
The sessions will take place from September- June. Teachers will receive more support in the 
areas of co-teaching and Common Core  content based writing. These sessions will take place 
during the months of January-June.

Researchers have been studying the effects of parent involvement and participation on their 
children’s academic success for many years.  When parents are involved in their children’s 
education at home, they do better in school.  When parents are involved in schools, children go 
farther in school and the schools they go to are better. 
It is essential to have all parents serve as active agents in the child’s education.  Therefore, a 
variety of activities must continue to be implemented for the upcoming school year to help 
improve parent participation at Title III parent workshops.  Many parents of the ENL student 
population do not speak English.  Ms. Sosa-Ramos and Ms. Nellie Franco will conduct the 
workshops.  Parents will receive letters and then follow-up phone calls inviting them to attend 
workshops throughout the school year.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
All correspondence and meetings are conducted in English and Spanish.  The workshops will 
focus on strategies, methodologies parents can utilize to help their child improve on the ELA, 
Math, and the NYSESLAT assessments.  Parents will receive valuable working knowledge of 
ways to support and help their children to achieve success.  Workshops will be conducted in both 
English and Spanish. 
Parent workshops will occur on a monthly basis. The ENL teachers will have workshops during 
the day from September-June for 45 minutes.  The parent coordinator will provide monthly 
workshops from September- June during the school day: one hour and the School Leadership 
Team will provide three parent workshops for the year: December, March and May. The 
workshops will be for one hour. Researchers have evidence for the positive effects of parent 
involvement on children, families, and school when schools and parents continuously support 
and encourage the children's learning and development (Eccles & Harold, 1993; Illinois State 
Board of Education, 1993). According to Henderson and Berla (1994), "the most accurate 
predictor of a student's achievement in school is not income or social status but the extent to 
which that student's family is able to: 
1.   Create a home environment that encourages learning 
2.   Express high (but not unrealistic) expectations for their children's achievement and future 
careers 
3.   Become involved in their children's education at school and in the community (p. 160) 
Henderson and Berla (1994) reviewed and analyzed eighty-five studies that documented the 
comprehensive benefits of parent involvement in children's education. This and other studies 
show that parent involvement activities that are effectively planned and well implemented result 
in substantial benefits to children, parents, educators, and the school. 
 It is essential to have all parents serve as active agents in their child's education. Therefore, a 
variety of activities must continue to be implemented for the upcoming school year to  improve 
parent participation at Title III parent workshops.  Many parents of the ENL student population 
do not speak English.  Ms. Sosa-Ramos/Ms. Franco will conduct all workshops in English and 
Spanish.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Paste response to questions here:   
 At P.S. 75 we use the Fontas & Pinnel Running Records (TCRWP) assessment for literacy and the Ready Gen baseline.  These 
assessments evaluate students’ knowledge of phonics, spelling patterns, sight words, reading levels, etc. We also use 
assessments from Fundations and teacher created assessments for English Language Learners (ELL’s).  These assessments 
provide more detailed information about alphabet recognition (lower and upper case), the ability to write the letters of the 
alphabet, knowledge of letter sounds and how many words a child knows in English.  These assessments are given in addition 
to the NYSITELL which is given to all potential ELLs. ELLs are also administered the MOSL: Measure of student learning in the 
beginning and the end of the school year.  We use all of the information from these assessments to group students and set 
goals for instruction for each child. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

ELL student are pulled out and administered these assessments by the ENL teacher. The ENL teachers group students 
according to the data and provide ENL instruction to meet individual student needs. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Paste response to question here:  
We evaluate the success of our ENL program based upon student progress and achievement.  We have found student 
portfolio’s to be the best measure of student progress since the NYSESLAT scores simply indicate whether or not a student is 
reading and writing on grade level. The MOSL is administered in the beginning of the school year and at the end. This data 
provides teachers with information to differentiate instruction. We at PS 75 have noticed that our ELLs struggle in the area of 
writing. Our students engage in content based writing projects. Teacher’s College running records with leveled reading 
passages allow us to track growth in reading and pinpoint the skills and lessons that students need.  We use teacher 
assessments to monitor concepts that were recently taught and we have found that these assessments measure student 
progress in more detail.  We also use portfolios to reflect authentic activities that students have been learning in the classroom 
and to provide a multidimensional perspective of student growth over time. The NYSESLAT is a good indicator of English 
language development and growth for the modalities of listening and speaking.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The ENL teachers push in and pull out to provide support in the area of reading and writing. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Paste response to question here: 
Data gathered from the NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, ELA and Math,  informal assessments and portfolios drives instruction for ELLs at 
P.S.75.   English language learners are pulled-out by the ENL teacher to work in small groups according to their level of English 
proficiency.  Differentiation  and instructional scaffolds are used to tailor instruction to each student's individual needs.   At 
P.S.75,  we view the native language of English language learners as an educational asset that will ultimately support their 
English language success.  Our Response to Intervention process begins with an initial screening during registration when a 
student enters our school for the first time.  A Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) is completed and parents and 
students are interviewed by the ENL teacher to get more information about the students' background and educational 
history.  This interview reveals factors that could influence the students' English language learning process such as first 
language proficiency, immigration patterns, socioeconomic status and culture.  Once it is determined that a student is an 
English Language Learner,  the NYSITELL  is administered to determine whether or not he/she requires the support of ENL 
services.  The data from this examination guides further assessments to develop a full profile of the student as a speaker, 
reader and writer.  Further assessments, both formal and informal, allow us to determine exactly what type of language and 
academic support a student requires and to create small groupings, accordingly.  Both our formal and informal assessments 
are on-going and this data drives the way that students are grouped for instruction.  Our student groupings are flexible, 
dynamic and constantly evolving based on assessment data.  ELLs are monitored to assess their progress on the continuum of 
learning language, literacy skills and competencies and grade level benchmarks.  Both the classroom and ENL teacher monitor 
student progress in a systematic process to impact student achievement.  Data is gathered throughout the year from our 
running records and other informal assessments.  The partnership between  the classroom teacher and language support 
services is especially important for ELLs which have been determined to be at risk.  Together, we determine whether a student 
is struggling because of language acquisition or whether further testing is required to test for a learning disability (LD).  This 
prevents us from making the unfortunate error of placing English language learners (ELLs) into special education 
because  language acquisition has been misinterpreted as a learning or language disability. Intensive, targeted intervention is 
provided to support ELLs who are not showing sufficient progress on the skills and/or competencies measured.  At P.S.75, we 
only utilize strategies that are research-based with for entire student population including ELLs.   We offer an after school and 
or Saturday program for ELLs in grades 2-5. The selection of students is based on student assessments mentioned previously, 
class work, and ENL along with classroom teacher recommendations.

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Paste response to question here:   
The data patterns across performance levels reveal that nine students are beginners (entering) and five students are 
emerging.  Therefore, oral language development, learning letters and numbers, phonics and beginning reading and writing 
skills are major goals for our ELL’s. , According to our June 2018 NYSITELL data, four students are transitional and five students 
are expanding.  These students will continue to receive differentiation in small group instruction, scaffolding and ENL 
strategies throughout the literacy block. The students who are at the transitional and expanding levels will engage in more 
independent reading with assignments that target their individual needs. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Teachers work in small groups, one on one to provide suppport with all assessments. ENL teachers work in small groups to 
assess in Words Their Way and the NYSITELL. ENL teachers push into the classroom to support ELLs in the area of ELA. Students 
who need more support such as beginners are pulled out for extra support. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Paste response to questions here:     
The English as a New Language (ENL) program at P.S.75 is a freestanding pull out program.  Students are grouped 
homogeneously within grade bands and according to what skills the child needs to learn.  The teacher servicing this 
program is certified in teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages.  Instruction is given exclusively in English 
using ENL methodology in order to foster proficiency and competency in the four modalities of listening, speaking, 
reading and writing. Classroom teachers and ENL teachers meet to plan lessons in all content areas. This allows ENL 
students an opportunity to receive the same  instruction as their peers . The ENL teacher provides scaffolds to support 
the content being taught. 
   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Paste response to questions here:   NA 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Paste response to questions here:  
 The ENL teachers ensure that mandated minutes are met in each instructional program.  In the ENL Program, English 
Language Learners (ELLs) from kindergarten to grade five are grouped according to their level of English language proficiency 
and grade level.   Entering (Beginner) and Emerging (Lower Intermediate) ELLs receive 360 minutes or 2 units of support each 
week.  Transitioning (Intermediate) and Expanding (Advanced) ELLs receive 180 minutes or 1 unit of support each 
week.  Commanding (Proficient) ELLs must continue to receive services for 2 years.  Home language arts support is offered 
through various activities  and a multilicultural library.  ELLs in our classes also receive instruction as mandated by NYS CR Part 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

154.  Students in ENL receive ELA instruction each day in Reading and Writing blocks with classroom teachers and therefore 
they surpass the required 180 weekly minutes of ELA instruction.   The required minutes are reflected on the schedule for the 
ENL teacher and on class schedules.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Paste response here:  
 In ENL, all of the content areas are explored through oral language development, Guided Reading, Shared Reading, 
Independent Reading, Word Study and Writing activities.  The ENL teacher also provides progress reports and assessments to 
classroom teachers of ELLs.  This maintains a level of consistency between the classroom and ENL instruction and integrates 
language and content.   Classroom teachers also differentiate for their English language learners.   Students also study in the 
content areas with their classroom teachers who employ visuals, gestures, slower speech and an emphasis on vocabulary to 
make content comprehensible to English language learners. The workshop model of the Balanced Literacy Program is used as 
an umbrella approach to foster a variety of ENL instructional strategies that promote communicative and linguistic 
competence and academic proficiency.  Such strategies include Cooperative Learning, which encourages interactive student 
participation and promotes social and academic language skills.  
 In the classes, the content areas are explored throughout the day through a variety of programs and curriculum.  The school 
utilizes 50 minute blocks across seven teaching periods per day.   
      Our instruction in ENL classrooms prepares students to meet the demands of Common Core Standards  by helping students 
to build a strong academic foundation in both the native and second languages.  Students are taught the most essential 
vocabulary and language functions to understand  tasks.  Teachers use visuals when introducing new words and concepts and 
build background knowledge.  All of this supports students academic achievement and the challenges of reading complex and 
informational text. Students who are new to PS 75 and do not possess the English language are paired with a peer who can 
support them in their native language. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   Paste response to question here:  
 Children are identified as English Language Learners using the New York State NYSITELL.  ELL's who are native Spanish 
speakers are also given the Spanish LAB to assess their abilities in their native language.  At the current time P.S. 75 evaluates 
in English, since all instruction is delivered in English  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Paste response to questions here:  
6.     At P.S. 75 we differentiate instruction for our ELL subgroups. One-on-one conferencing is a best practice used throughout 
the school to research each student and plan academically.  Students are grouped by ability an each group is taught a different 
lesson daily, according to the needs of each group of students.   
a.     Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE’s) are usually working far below grade level standards, even in their 
native language.  Therefore, these students receive additional time and support beyond the mandated instructional 
minutes.  They also receive more support in the content areas since they tend to be lagging academically in all subjects. 
b.     Newcomers (in U.S. schools for less than 3 years) also receive additional time and support beyond the mandated 
instructional minutes.  Total Physical Response activities are used in order to accelerate language acquisition through the use 
of the kinesthetic sensory system.  The Natural Approach in which meaningful context is stressed and students strive for 
communicative fluency is also used as an instructional strategy.  In addition, the Language Experience Approach is used 
allowing language to be acquired by relating it to the experiences and interest of students.  
c.     Guided Reading is an essential component in our literacy program and it is used extensively to support ELL’s.  The 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

structure of Guided Reading lessons offers Ell’s the support that they need to explore and discuss a wide variety of topics and 
content while building vocabulary.  In addition, these students practice learned strategies within texts on their reading 
level.  The Cognitive Academic Language Learning Approach is used as a vehicle to provide content-based ENL instruction for 
students at the emerging, transitioning and expanding levels.  Each of these strategies is used as a tool to promote linguistic 
and academic excellence leading to the increase of State assessment scores for English Language Learners 
d.     Currently, we do not have any long-term Ells (completed 6+ years).  However, the school has support systems in place to 
help students who may need additional academic intervention.  Small group work and differentiation are best practices 
employed by teachers throughout the building to target each student’s individual needs.  We have also found that most long-
term Ells require a focused approach to vocabulary development in order to comprehend complex texts.  Developing reading 
skills is especially important for long-term Ells to support academic achievement across all subject areas. 
e.     Former Ells’ (in years 1 and 2 after testing proficient/commanding) are still monitored for academic success.  The ENL and 
classroom teacher continues to monitor progress and collaborate to support struggling students.  Former ELLs receive the 
mandated testing modifications on state exams.  Going forward new regulations require that former ELLs continue to receive 
services for at least 2 years following the school year in which a student is exited from ELL status (90 minutes per week).  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Paste response to question here:  
   At the present time, we have 10 students with disabilities who are English Language Learners at P.S. 75.  The system is in 
place to investigate the needs of any ELL-SWD who enters the school.  These systems include Parent Orientations and staff 
meetings that therapist, social worker, psychologists, special education and ELL personnel attend. Any ELL-SWD attending 
P.S.75 would receive instructional strategies and grade level materials appropriate for that student and according to their 
individual needs.  We would also provide access to academic content areas and accelerate English language development using 
supports unique to that individual, if necessary.  All students have access to the same curricula. Teachers provide various ENL 
methods, strategies and scaffolds to support student individual needs. teachers also have materials in Spanish to support our 
new students. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Paste response to question here:  
We currently have ELL-SWDs at P.S75, we are prepared for such a student to enter our school.  Our contingency plan is to form 
a team composed mainly of support staff to accommodate the needs of the child.  School personnel on this team would 
include teachers, guidance counselor,  social worker, school psychologists, nurse, speech, occupational and physical 
therapists.  Curriculum, instruction, and scheduling will be adjusted, if necessary, to meet the needs of such students.  The 
students' IEP is the guiding document for such a process.  Students in regular and special education are not segregated and 
students with disabilities would be fully integrated into the school community through flexible scheduling.  Our goal would be 
to keep the student in the least restrictive environment and to make this student feel as welcome and comfortable in our 
school as possible, while meeting their academic needs.     
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Paste response to question here:   
Several staff members provide support services to English Language Learners at P.S.75.  All ELLs receive ENL support.  In English 
Language Arts, ELLs are supported by classroom teachers who align their instruction with the Common Core Learning 
Standards, (CCLS) through small group work; differentiated instruction, and scaffolding throughout the day.  Also, math 
instruction is aligned with the CCLS to differentiate for ELLs by reading about math extensively, building strong math 
vocabulary and practicing math word problems. In the other content areas, (Science and Social Studies) teachers work with the 
students by providing them non-fiction materials to support the learning in the content areas.  In addition to ENL services, 
support services include Speech, and SETTS.   During the pull out sessions, ENL teachers provide students with targeted

instruction based on assessment data: Unit assessments, NYSESLAT, Running Records, and writing samples. PS 75 provides a 
Saturday program that supports our ELL students in grades 2-5. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Paste response to question here:  
This upcoming school year, the ENL program will hold a schoolastic book fair.  We hope to make a strong connection between 
parents of ELL's and our school community through this event.  The purpose of this book fair is to get both students and 
parents more excited about literacy.  Parents who have come from other countries will see books that reflect their culture, 
language and traditions.  We hope that they will purchase some of these books and be excited about reading them with their 
children.  The book fair will also feature leveled reading material alongside multicultural books.  This way, students have the 
opportunity to acquire an abundance of reading material on the appropriate reading levels for their homes.  For many 
students, this will be the beginning of a home library that we hope students and parents will continue to grow and build 
upon.       
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Paste response to question here:   
We do not have any programs or services being discontinued for ELL's.    
  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Paste response to question here:  
All ELL's are afforded equal access to both academic and after school programs.  School calendar letters and information 
regarding extracurricular activities are translated into each students' language to facilitate communication between home and 
school. PS 75 offers a Saturday Academy program for grade 2-5. Grade 2 students use the Support Coach program which 
focuses on reading comprehension. Grades 3-5 are supported by the READY new York CCLS Program in both ELA and 
Mathematics. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Paste response to question here: 
Instructional materials used to support ELL’s include materials for the Ready Gen, Guided Reading materials, and Big Books for 
Shared Reading, Fundations notebooks and letter tiles.  We use several technology programs including ‘Imagine learning 
English’ ‘Starfall’ and ABCYa’.” “Education through Music” is a program which supports students learning through the arts.     
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Paste response to question here:   
Home language support is provided in ENL classes through multicultural libraries which include books in Spanish.  Through the 
use of cognate words, the students are able to recognize the similarity between the two languages. Students receive 
independent text in which they choose in their home language. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Paste response to question here:  
ELL's receiving required services are supported with resources that correspond to their ages and grade levels.   Materials are 
aligned and differentiated according to the needs of the students.  Vocabulary, scaffold materials, pictures, and thinking maps 
are available with the Ready Gen and Go Math programs. 
Ready Gen reading program has structures to support the Ells and struggling students.  Go Math provides manipulatives, and 
hands-on projects that allow students to succeed.     
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Paste response to question here: 
Our school does not share a building.    

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Paste response to question here:  
Newly enrolled students are made to feel right at home when they come to P.S. 75.  The parent and student are given a tour of 
the school and introduced to their teacher and classmates on the first day.  Students are assessed as soon as they are admitted 
and academic goals are established.  Goals and objectives are set for each individual.  Students are paired up with buddies 
during the school day.  Students are given formal and informal assessment regularly to monitor their growth in their basic 
interpersonal skills and cognitive academic language.  They are also afforded a meet and greet with teachers at their first 
attendance day to ensure the student and parents can feel welcomed. The Parent Coordinator and PTA set-up workshops for 
parent to better immerse themselves in the community.  All correspondences to parents are sent in the desired language and 
on a timely manner.  
   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Paste response to question here: 
At P.S. 75, language electives are not offered to Ells.    
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Paste response to question here:  
P.S. 75 has no Dual Language programs 
  
  
 

 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
  
Paste response to question here:  
All pedagogical staff participates in professional development several times a year.  The Brooklyn North Borough Field Support 
provides the ENL teachers participate in trainings offered to school staff across all subject areas to stay abreast of changes to 
the curriculum and grade level benchmarks.  The ENL teachers are also supported by professional learning sessions through 
the Brooklyn North Field Support.  The sessions offered are tailored to support ENL teachers in all the content areas, Teachers 
attend a series usually four to six sessions to ensure they are receiving the skills needed to meet the needs of the students.  
Paste response to question here:  
The professional learning committee at PS 75 view data from student assessment data, observations and surveys to provide 
pedagogical support. Teacher teams which include all pedagogical faculty meet on Mondays for professional learning activities 
to improve pedagogical practices. The professional learning sessions include the following topics: 
Five pillars in literacy, leveled libraries, independent books, manipulatives in mathematics, vocabulary for math and ELA, 
protocols to support student engagement, assessment , and discussions. The teams engage in a six week cycle that focuses on 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

 

content based instruction, teaching strategies, and use of various materials. The cycles are differentiated to meet the 
individual teacher needs. During the cycle, teachers take what they have learned, try the new learning in the classroom, report 
back to the team the following week, and the team determines if the practice was successful and or ways to modify instruction 
to support  the new learning.  
 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Paste response to question here:  
The school counselor, Ms. Rita Carrington, and parent coordinator, Mrs. Lucy Belardo, assist ELL’s throughout the process as 
they transition from elementary to middle school.  They ensure that important documents are translated into the students’ 
home language and that translators are available, if needed. They also maintain an open-door policy if parents have questions 
or concerns   
Paste response to question here: 
We keep agendas and records of all professional development workshops attended by teachers.  Going forward, we will 
increase the number of ELL-specific workshops held in-house so that these workshop represent 15% of our teachers’ total 
professional development.  The ENL teachers will be attending ELL-specific professional development provided from the 
Brooklyn North Field Support Specialists. This information will be turn-keyed to staff, particularly teachers of ELLs, at the 
school.  All teachers, other than those who hold ENL and bilingual licenses, are required to attend 7.5 hours of ELL training (10 
hours of special education teachers).  These professional learning sessions educate teachers about the unique make-up of the 
student population in New York City Public Schools.  It also introduces teachers to legal mandates, support services and 
instructional practices for English Language Learners.  Teachers sign in and receive agendas for each session. Attendance is 
recorded.  These attendance records and agendas are kept on file in the ENL office in our building.  The ENL teacher will keep 
records of ELL-specific professional development that is provided to teachers both in-house and through Department of 
Education Office of Language Learners   The professional sessions take place during school hours: Borough Field support 
Center and on Mondays during the professional learning time. Teachers engage in content based activities, methodologies, 
and strategies to support student learning. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Paste response to question here:  
P.S. 75 will provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language development 
progress, language proficiency assessment result and language development needs in the content areas.  These individual 
meetings will be planned on Tuesdays after school which are reserved for parent meetings in our building.  Meetings will be 
held with the classroom teacher and the ENL teachers.  This will allow parents to receive information about all content based 
areas. Translators are provided as necessary and meetings are planned throughout the year so that parents have the 
opportunity to get several updates on their child’s progress.   

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Paste response to question here:  
At P.S.75, our parents (including parents of Ells) are involved in our school community through volunteering, the Parent-
Teacher Association (PTA), and the School Leadership Team (SLT).  Both the PTA and the SLT meet once a month.  The PTA 
helps parents become involved in their children’s education, support school life and activities, share ideas and enrich their 
school community. The SLT determines the structure for school-based planning and shared decision making.  These school-

based organizations are open to all parent and guardians of children currently attending P.S.75, including parents of English 
Language Learners.  The Parent Coordinator facilitates several workshops each year to inform parents about topics like 
promotional policies, ELA /Math Testing and strengthening literacy.   We offer a monthly Superhero workshop for fathers. 
These workshops provide information in which fathers can assist their child/ren in school. Guest speakers from the community 
who talk to the fathers about activities for the family. We also have student work showcases that the parents have an 
opportunity to view and write comments. The SLT offers workshops for parents in the area of curriculum, arts and crafts, and 
cooking. During the 2016-2017, we had our first family fun day. Parents and students engaged in family activities: Games, 
dances, socializing with one another. We plan to make this an annual event. We have planned the following workshops for the

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Yolanda Williams, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Data to access language preferences of the parent community for both written translation and oral interpretation 
begins with parents at registration. Both parents and children are interviewed and the Home Language 
Identification Survey (HLIS) is discussed during the registration process. The HLIS has 2 questions that parents 
must answer regarding their preference for written communication and oral communication with the school. This 
information is then entered by the school secretary into ATS and a report is generated for the Parent Coordinator. 
The Parent Coordinator uses this information to get documents translated into the parents preferred language. 
These documents include the Parent Handbook, the yearly school calendar, the monthly school calendar and 
many other documents.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71

Most parents at PS75 speak one 
languages but most prefer to receive all 
communication in English. A few parents 
of ELLs have requested written and oral 
communication in another language. 
These language is Spanish. 

 

   

 

 

 

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A. 
 

 

 

 
 
Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services 
 
1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be 

distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.

Face to face meeting with parents occur throughout the school year. 
Parent Orientations are required for parents of new ELLs and these 
meetings occur in September and throughout the school year. 
Parent-teacher conferences occur in September, November and 
March. Curriculum Night occurs in September. We will also have 
individual meetings with parents of ELLs on Tuesdays throughout the 
year since Tuesday afternoons are designated for parent meetings 
throughout our building.  

 

   

 

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Teachers are informed of the policy in the beginning of the school year. The ESL Teachers provide all staff members 
with professional learning sessions to ensure everyone is aware and adhere to Regulation A-663. Teachers also 
receive a copy of the regulation. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Welcome Poster's are at the main entrance of our school in various languages including the preferred languages 
indicated on Home Language Surveys completed by parents at registration. There are also Language ID Guides at the 
security desk and in our main office. Office staff use these guides, if necessary, to determine which language a parent 
speaks and to get a translator who speaks that language. Office staff will also call the ENL teacher to assist the parent 
and obtain translation assistance. We provide each parent whose primary language is a covered language and who 
require language assistance services with a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities and the Parents' 
Guide to Language Access. The Bill of Parent Right and Responsibilities explains their rights to translation and

interpretation services. These documents are given to parents at registration if they indicate a preferred language 
other than English on the Home Language Survey. We keep translated versions of the documents available. 
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Our school uses the Parent Survey to gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services.
