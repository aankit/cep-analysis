Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Philosophy of Teaching and Learning:  

Students are at the center of all learning experiences at Bronx Theatre High School. We have learned that the type of 
learning experiences are represented in three models of our instructional practices: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

1. Collaborative Learning with Structured Groups 

2. Socratic Seminar  

3. Project Based Learning  

Building on a model of theatrical teaching developed by Roundabout Theatre Company, our planning team has begun 
to structure a collaborative teaching methodology that integrates theatre process right into the bones of instructional 
practice. Heterogeneous groups will share classes to collaborate and learn from each other. The curriculum will focus 
on particular themes in order to encourage critical thinking and in-depth comprehension while maintaining the 
challenges required of the Common Core Learning Standards. Classroom activities will be hands-on and project-based 
in order to stimulate creativity for the group as well as for the individual. Extended class time will enable students to 
engage in classroom activities and will enable students to have more time on-task. Within a smaller learning 
environment, we are able to make strong connections with students, attend to their unique needs and provide the 
supports and scaffolds so they continue to take risks, trust in their efforts and find success in overcoming challenges. 
The theatre process allows our students to formulate and foster trusting relationships between teachers, staff and 
students. 

Our goal is to engage students academically and socially – it’s all about academic and social maturation. Our school 
environment borrows the best practices from the theatre community model and matches them to the best strategies 
for youth development. We look to the effectiveness of Roundabout Theatre Company as an organization whose 
"workers" are happy, healthy and engaged in their work and see that high standards are achieved through close 
relationships, high expectations, engaging activities, collaborative participation and continued involvement of all 
company members. This is our vision of Bronx Theatre High School.  

The academic program at Bronx Theatre High School will accommodate the intellectual, social, emotional and physical 
needs of creative high school students. Our vision is to provide students with a dynamic learning environment where 
respect is mutual, ideas are shared and learning is not limited to the classroom. Our school is a safe and nurturing 
environment where learning takes place in the classroom, in the theatre studios, in our community. 

Our concept of a successful school is one built collaboratively by its staff, students, parents, community members and 
our partner organizations. We prepare students for higher education and provide them with the skills needed to be 
college and career ready.  

Students have opportunities to express themselves and have a "voice" in school culture. A tenth grade student stated, 
“My favorite first moment at Bronx Theatre High School was the dream project in English because I got to express 
myself. I got to show people my dream in life. I’m in the midst of achieving my dream right now!” A senior 
commented, “I focused and really paid attention. Now I love my school for what it is, for the beautiful students and 
teachers in it.”  One student who improved his attendance recollected, I really felt great when we had the perfect 
attendance party. It felt good to be celebrated for coming to school. That had never happened to me before." 

Bronx Theatre High School has partnered with Roundabout Theatre Company since its inception in 2003 and 
continues to provide students with experiences both inside and outside the classroom. Teaching artists work with 
students in pre-show workshops to provide students with the analytical skills needed to determine plot, theme, 
predictions and a thorough analysis of the performance. Students take these skills back to the classroom and apply 
them to the various content areas in order to build critical thinking skills and develop college readiness. 

Our curriculum will be aligned with the CCLS. Students will be well prepared to pass the Regents examinations 
required for graduation. The preparation and rigorous instructional program will prepare all students to meet and 
surpass graduation requirements.

Key design features of the instructional practice that will be consistently applied in our school include: Alternative 
Instruction Practices: Resource literature in constructivism, backward mapping, student-centered and inquiry-based 
activity, interdisciplinary project planning and jigsaw strategies will inform lesson planning; 

• Scaffolding: Students will develop into self-directed learners and creative thinkers by beginning the 9th grade year 
with simple, classroom based production projects. The themes of the plays will be aligned with Global Studies and the 
research required to create the play will be heavily guided as a way to introduce the process. Students will go on to 
develop more and more complex productions with greater autonomy as they move through the interdisciplinary 
content sequence. 

• Performance Assessment and Sequential Artist Instruction will inform the scope and sequence of the school 
curriculum; 

• Ongoing professional development and collaborative planning for the teaching staff will include daily collaborative 
and independent preps for all teachers, weekly administration meetings with all staff and members of student/parent 
leadership teams and monthly professional development activities; 

• Students Support Services including homework help, peer tutoring, daily advisory meetings and full inclusion 
programming for special education students (with a push-in resource teacher where needed) will offer all students 
the opportunity to learn; 

• Extended Day activities will provide opportunities for students to work on homework, earn work-study credits, 
participate in independent production projects, join clubs and athletic teams, produce parent/student theatre 
workshops, and participate in monthly parent/student/teacher conferences and special events. 

 

The following principles will guide the planning team of this school in establishing a math/language literacy plan for all 
students. 

• Evidence shows a direct correlation between the Arts and literacy. (See Critical Links) 

• Evidence shows a correlation between involvement in arts programs and success in school. (See Champions of 
Change) 

• Theatre is a language based art form that requires knowledge and skill in science, math, social studies, language 
arts, music, dance, visual arts and technology to fully understand and communicate universal themes of human 
experience through plot, character, thought, language, music and spectacle. 

• Theatre conveys meaning through a variety of media that provide alternatives for visual, kinesthetic and auditory 
learners. 

• Theatre production is rich with practical applications for students to learn math concepts and skills with a hands-on 
approach.Students will be rotated into set and lighting design projects, which will integrate math concepts into the 
year-round production schedule. 

• Students with skill deficits in math and language will be assigned to weekly after school tutorials, peer-tutoring and 
push-in support from literacy specialists. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12 

 

Bronx Theatre High School has a 23% population of students with Special Needs. Special needs students learn in an 
I.C.T . setting, and self contained classes in Accordance with their I.E.P. Instruction is delivered by a licensed teacher in 
various content areas, as well as a licensed special education teacher. Bronx Theatre High School has 15% ENL 
students. Instruction is delivered in both an I.C.T classes as well, push in, and stand alone. See LAP/Title III 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Bronx Theatre has increased substantially the amount of students graduating college and career ready from 18.1% in 
2017 to 49.5% in 2018. As a result, there has been an increase in the school's graduation from 66% in 2017, to 80% in 
June of 2018. The school continues to encourage students to achieve the college ready indicators on both English and 
math regents exams through the At Home In College Curriculum so that graduating students will not be in remedial 
courses their freshman year in college. 

Bronx Theatre has achieved high scores in moving students with special needs populations into the least restrictive 
environment.  

Key areas of focus this year for the school are credit accumulation, higher Regents test scores, writing with emphasis 
on citing evidence from the text, and improving math scores for our black male students. These areas have been 
identified from school wide data systems including NV Portal, STARS, Skedula and NYS report cards. Baseline 
assessments have revealed the need to stress writing, particularly citing evidence from the text. Examination of 
previous US History and Global History Regents exams revealed that students lack writing skills to address the written 
essays of the exams and this further identified the need for this initiative. 

1. Rigorous Instruction: This year's focus will center around how teachers can engage students in the learning process 
by having rich student centered activities. Teachers will plan and provide instruction using the following 3 lesson 
formats: 1. Socratic Seminar 2. Collaborative Learning 3. Project Based Learning. It is our goals to have students 
reading and writing more frequently in all content areas as well as providing students with rich discussion activities. 
New Visions provides curriculum offerings, and teachers will be working collaboratively with New Visions professional 
developers in order to increase their engagement and to learn new instructional techniques. 

2. Supportive Environment: Students need to have more voice and choice in what and how they are learning. We 
believe that students learn best when they see the real world applications of the content areas. To this end, it is our 
goal that all students feel comfortable speaking with staff and faculty. We are attempting to change the culture of the 
campus and our school, by allowing student leaders to set goals, develop action plans for the Campus. We feel 
strongly that students need to think deeply about their lives and how their behaviors effect others. All teachers are 
working collaboratively to create a college going culture where students are learning to be responsible, and we are 
setting up opportunities for them to showcase their efforts.  

Special Populations & Needs: 

Bronx Theatre High School has special education and ENL populations that need additional support in reading, writing 
and mathematics. Our effective program will create the conditions/environment where the students are safe, feel 
welcomed and comfortable. In such a space, they are able to take risks in using the second language without being 
afraid of making mistakes. Effective teachers know that it is important to create a positive classroom environment 
where the affective filter is kept low, and the relationship between teacher and student and student-to-student is 
embedded within the concept of care. This type of environment enables students to engage comfortably in the 
various activities, whether individually, in small groups or in whole class, without worrying about how they sound in 
the second language. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

Teachers were provided a ICT Handbook to guide their planning, and instruction phase of each lesson. The handbook 
describes in great detail the specific instructional expectations in each area. Our goal is to provide teachers with 
support, in order to meet the needs of each learner at their level of instruction.  

ELLs also need to develop literacy skills appropriate for the instructional context of the higher academic standards 
that are required today. All ENL students will be provided push in services, or stand alone or a combination of both in 
order to meet the required number of minutes to support their individual needs.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Strengths: 

  The school has a variety of course offerings for diverse learners and to foster college and career readiness. 

Currently there are AP classes in English, Spanish, US History, and Science. Since we are co located on a 
Campus, we share Advance Placement classes with Law & Finance. We currently send 10 of our students to 
their AP Statistics class. Students also can take Epidemiology, which is a NYCDOE CPCC (College Preparatory 
Certified Course). CUNY at Home courses in Math and English offer instructional support so that students are 
prepared for CUNY admissions exams as well as preparation for learners who have not yet earned the college 
readiness benchmark of 75 in English or 80 in Math.  
Junior/Senior courses have incorporated various types of writing formats such as APA, MLA and Chicago style 
in order to prepare students for college writing. 

 

  All courses are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards utilizing a crosswalk with EngageNY and then 
vetted in teams, and finally uploaded to Atlas – the school wide model uses the Tri-State Rubric to continually 
modify and improve our units. 

Needs: 

  More inclusion of rigorous college writing formats/tasks in the lower grades. 
  More in-depth analysis and explanation including the use of citations thereby showcasing writers’ abilities to 

develop their argument, defend it and provide counter claim responses 

  Offering higher level math courses to all students, while ensuring that all students achieve College readiness.  
  More instructional writing tasks & time on task requiring students to skill fully cite appropriate evidence from 

text in order to elucidate their thought processes and develop strong claims. 

  More instruction utilizing questioning and discussion strategies that foster increased student-to-student 

interaction. 

  Develop protocols for heterogeneous student groups, with specific assigned roles.  
  More time for administrators to engage in thoughtful reflection regarding the development of all Developing 

and Ineffective HEDI ratings, specifically SSOP 3.3 (DDI) 

Summary of student/data performance trends: 

Bronx Theatre High School students are having difficulty with understanding and writing about challenging texts. 
Students have difficulty with analysis in its various forms and content areas. In 2018, 58.22% passed the Common 
Core English Regents examination highlighting students need for improved performance in writing and analysis. In 
2018, 56% of students passed the Math Regents. Our students are having difficulty with the new CCLS, and through 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16 

 

Inquiry, we are setting into place systems and structures to analyze data and develop interventions to address the 
need of the CC shifts. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
The school will maintain an instructional focus on writing, utilizing evidence from the text across all content areas in 
order to increase student ELA & Math scores by 5% by June 2019. Specifically we would like to improve the math scores 
by 5% for our black male students.

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Baseline assessments will be administered to all students, 
including General Education, Students with special needs, and 
ENL students. Teachers will develop action plans to address the 
needs of each learner. Action plans will be reviewed by teams, 
and measured against student outcomes. Revisions will be 
ongoing to unit and lesson plans in order to improve student 
outcomes through tailored instruction. Instruction strategies will 
include: Socratic Seminar, Collaborative Learning, and Project 
Based Instruction.  

Students will be reintegrated during student/ parent 
conferences, and signed up to take part in Kingsbridge Heights 
Community Center family services. All students will be invited to 
take part in College Trips, Circles, and other school wide events. 
A dedicated College Office has been constructed and College 
Counselors will incorporate the Naviance platform to enhance 
college exploration.  

Plan and deliver professional development workshops in 
writing/literacy strategies as well as questioning/discussion 
techniques, and analyzing student work using Atlas Protocols, in 
teacher teams that engage all learners to support teachers in 
classroom instruction. Instruction strategies will include: Socratic 
Seminar, Collaborative Learning, and Project Based Instruction.  

Host regular parent workshops on a variety of topics including 
the following: Supporting Students/Academics, College 
Readiness, Understanding the Common Core & Instructional 
Shifts, How to Utilize Pupil Path at Home, and communicate daily 
with families using Kinvolved.  

Plan and deliver bilingual English immersion classes with the aid 
of an interpreter/bilingual teacher/ Parent Coordinator for 
parents and students who are ELLS in an Enrichment Program. 
Included in these classes will be a turnkey of QTEL strategies that 
parents can use to support student’s reading and writing skills.

school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Strengths: 

  Observe teachers using the Danielson Framework for Teaching along with the analysis of learning outcomes 

to elevate school-wide instructional practices and implement strategies that promote professional growth 
and reflection. 

  Engage in structured professional collaborations on teams using an inquiry approach that promotes shared 

leadership and focuses on improved student learning. 

  The school effectively uses support systems including guidance counselors, social workers, New York 

Presbyterian Health Clinic, RAPP Coordinator (Mr. Silverman/4 th Floor), PPT and SIT teams to provide social 
and emotional support. 

  The SIT and PPT teams meet consistently to share information, trends and design interventions to support 
struggling students and students with IEPs. These teams systematically reflect and revise on practices and 
turn key vital information to staff via email, school meetings and professional developments. 

  The Dean’s office has made strides in aggregating data on discipline infractions and is working on utilizing 
more complex data systems to identify, isolate and target high leverage areas of improvement in student 
behavior.(See Rediker Software, Inc 

  Needs: 
 
  Ensure engaging, rigorous, and coherent curricula in all subjects, accessible for a variety of learners and 

Improve daily student attendance  

aligned to Common Core Learning Standards and/or content standards. 

  Develop teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs about how students learn best that is informed by 

the instructional shifts and Danielson Framework for Teaching, aligned to the curricula, engaging, and 
meeting the needs of all learners so that all students produce meaningful work. 

  More comprehensive data on patterns of student infraction. 
  More behavioral support for IEP students (they represent the majority of suspensions) in terms of PD. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Guidance Team, Deans Office, & Attendance Team will identify 
students who need support by reviewing teacher anecdotal, 
student referrals, and develop an action plan for each student 
that includes parental outreach. The parent coordinator will 
follow up with all parental and school interventions.  

Weekly grade team meetings will identify on track/ off track 
students using the NV Portal with 92% or greater attendance, 
92%-80% and 80% or lower. Unit pans and lesson plans will be 
revised to adjusted student needs. The parent coordinator will 
communicate with parents in the targeted sub groups. 

Identify high frequency locations and setting events that 
contribute to students missing classes. School personnel will 
monitor locations that are identified by increasing supervision. 
CBO will support students through social emotional counseling, 
and family supports. Guidance Counselors will support the 
academic and Social Emotional learning and factors affecting 
students with less than 92% attendance.  

All students will have an advisory class that meets on a daily 
basis for 20 minutes. Attendance incentives will be incorporated 
into each class that build on collaborative learning, and updated 
on the Google Drive.  

Parent coordinator will host regular parent workshops on a

identify students at risk and on track. Teacher Team members will work on action plans.  

KingsBridge Community Heights (CBO) will support social emotional learning of all students. They will arrange college 
trips for all students, including students that being re-intergrated into the school KHCC will also provide parents with 
counseling and resources. 

Attendance will be updated by teachers daily, every period and sent directly to parents cell phone via Kinvolved app. 
Parents will have the opportunity to meet with communicate with teachers using the Kinvolved text messenger app.  

Strategies At School 

Bronx Theatre High School's social emotional learning program: a specific program to support social-emotional 
learning, problem-prevention and health promotion activities, support services to address transitions, crises, and 
conflicts, and a commitment to community service. 

Organize guest speakers. Work with your school's parent organization to identify experts within your community who 
can speak to parents and teachers about strategies for nurturing emotionally intelligent children. 

Get involved. Consider volunteering for a school or school district committee responsible for overseeing the 
implementation of programs to support social and emotional learning. Note: At a district level, these programs are 
often (though not always) part of a safety or violence prevention department. 

Celebrate diversity. Work with other parents and school staff to organize programs and events to celebrate and 
honor the many cultures in your school community. 

Begin the discussion. If your school does not have any programs around social and emotional learning, work with 
others in your school and larger community to bring together leaders from throughout your community -- 
businesspeople and law enforcement, parents and educators -- to discuss ways in which your community can make 
the emotional health and wellness of children a priority.

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not

 The English and social studies teams engaged in inquiry processes that focused on select students an assessment. 
The English team noticed that students could establish a position and support it with evidence from the text, but 
were challenged by the analysis needed to develop their support. Similarly, the social studies team found that 
students used relevant evidence, but did not explain how it supported the claim. Next steps included showing 
students examples of strong and weak evidence and have students revise and improve the weak examples. Notes 
from other meetings from these two teams show ongoing work, where implementation strategies along with 
analysis or reviews of student work are revisited consistently over time. Such professional collaborations 
strengthen the instructional capacity of teachers. 

 Notes from the math team’s meetings confirm a focus on curricular planning with evidence of inquiry work. 
Specific topics that were addressed across meetings included content that need to be covered, teaching styles, 
teaching strategies and pacing. Math teachers meet weekly during Professional Learning, and connect informally 
on a daily basis and during common planning. 

 Leadership noted that they meet weekly with teacher leaders to stay abreast of "what’s working and what’s not." 
They also stated that professional development is coordinated by a committee that is comprised predominantly of 
teachers. 

 Teachers noted that they work closely with the assistant principals on various aspects of their work. For example, 
some collaborated with an assistant principal to revise an instructional arc. \ 

 

 

Quality Review 2016-2017  

4.3 – Effective – Teachers, working in grade level and Departmental teams, align instruction to carefully selected 
Common Core Learning Standards that address skills needed to complete assessment tasks within each unit of study. 
Students are provided with instruction that addresses multiple skill levels, and CCLS aligned goals are articulated 
through feedback that targets student reading and writing needs and supports specific points of entry based on 
formative writing assessments such as NYC Performance Task or Regents based base-lines.  

4.4 – Effective – Teachers create a safe environment to support student learning and needs through CCLS aligned and 
arts based instruction that provides opportunities to explore content through multiple modes of engagement.  

4.5 – Effective – Teachers use a variety of formative and summative data to monitor student learning and inform 
targeted changes within curriculum to address specific student needs. Teachers administered baseline assessments 
early in the school-year and they continue to monitor student progress with formative assessments designed to track 
student understanding of content and reading & writing skills.  

English teachers enhance units and design new assessments to address specific Common Core Standards. The new 
unit assessments are models after EngageNY assessment activities. 

School’s strengths and needs: 

1. Teachers are successfully administering baselines and using data to inform instruction that is designed to support 
student writing skills. However, the time needed to complete the grading of the Regents tasks takes time away from 
planning in September and October. Additional assessments also take long periods of time to rate since they rely on 
essay writing tasks to assess student content understandings and reading and writing skills. 

Teachers are successfully using ATLAS to develop curriculum maps and align their assessments to CCLS, but common 
planning time for all teachers remains an issue. Most teachers are able to meet and plan with grade level or content 
teams, but some collaborative team teachers have difficulty meeting and planning due to program issues. Note that 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          26 

 

teachers have access to curriculum through ATLAS and can make adjustments to curriculum on-line and review the 
adjustments without a team teacher being present.

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional

Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Parents will receive monthly sessions at PTA meetings addressing 
current issues affecting their children. Issues such as prescription 
drug abuse, gang awareness, college readiness and blended 
learning have been scheduled for the school year. 

Since high needs students are the at risk population, all activities 
will address both Gen ed, SWD’s and ELL’s. 

School has created a schedule of workshops in advance and 
distributed to all parents and guardians at the beginning of the 
school year and each time a parent visits the school. School 
Messenger is set to send automated advance notifications to all 
parents for upcoming meetings. 

Parent outreach has promoted a positive environment for 
students using Kinvolved text messaging and transparency is key 
for all issues or events affecting students. Parent workshops have 
been designed based on a survey given to parents from the PTA 
identifying what they would like to be done this year. 

Strategic data checks, cycles of inquiry, and meetings will be 
utilized to ensure the action plan is implemented.

Goal: Develop “The School Pantry Program” 

The mission of the School Pantry Program is to help alleviate child hunger in America through the provision of food to 
children and their families at school. School-based pantries are located on the grounds of a school to provide an easily 
accessible source of food assistance to low-income students and their families. 

School Pantries take place at a consistent location within a school's campus that is student led. They have, have set 
distribution schedules and offer ongoing food assistance services. School Pantries may have a permanent set up 
within a school or may operate through a mobile distribution rotation that brings food to a school campus 

 

Part B: FOR NON-TITLE I SCHOOLS

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Bronx Theatre High School provides pedagogical staff with a wide variety of resources to increase teacher 
effectiveness and improve student outcomes. Newly hired teachers are provided a mentor/model teacher that meets 
weekly with the teacher and addresses any and all questions that may arise. The principal and assistant principals 
make educational rounds and visit teachers’ classrooms at least once per month and provides meaningful feedback 
and next steps for improved classroom instruction. Professional development is provided for all new teachers both in 
house and off site by Model Teacher, QTEL: Quality Teaching for English Language Learners, Text Complexity & 
Academic Language: Dr. Lily Wong Fillmore – UC Berkeley (“What Does Text Complexity Mean for English Language 
Learners and Language Acquisition”, SIOP Model (Sheltered Instructional Observation Protocol), Teachers College, ELI 
and New Visions on-going professional workshops and programs (A2I/G2i, US History, Living Environment, Drive to 
Write, AP for ALL). 

Teachers that are new to the school but not new to teaching must perform inter-visitations with other department 
members to share various methodologies of teaching. The principal observes these teachers once per month and has 
bi-monthly meetings with them for the first semester to ensure a smooth transition from one school to another. 
Assistant principals assigned to specific academic departments work with them to analyze and develop curriculum 
aligned to common core, lesson planning and classroom activities. 

 

To ensure that staff are Highly Qualified (e.g. HQT as fully licensed teachers that are assignment within their license 
area) we review resumes, check on references, and review all state and city licenses. Additionally, we review Advance 
and other teacher ratings and observations along with Logs of Assistance and disciplinary notices. We will make all 
efforts including checking with local colleges and universities, attending hiring fairs through NYC and NYS, in addition 
to efforts from New Visions for Public Schools. All teachers will be required to show proof of license on the TEACH 
system and be vetted by Human Resources NYCDOE.  

 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
The CCLS include six instructional shift so professional development will be provided by various outside sources to 
address these. Teachers College (CPET) has provided professional development in using the Danielson Framework for 
Teaching. NYC Leadership Coaches and New Visions Affinity support structures will work with the principal and 
administration in order to prepare the staff for higher teacher effectiveness and aligning curriculum and instruction. 
Since the school has assistant principals for the various academic subjects, they too will provide PD sessions in house 
during the teacher’s common planning time. The school’s PD plan will evolve as the needs of the staff change. 
Principal and assistant principals will attend various PD sessions throughout the year as provided by New Visions, ELI, 
Lead ON and Datacation.  

To further show evidence of differentiation, staff will also self select and attend pd offerings when administration 
notices a need for those areas. For example, teachers in AP for ALL will be attending PD sessions with colleagues in 
other schools, and the New Visions Pilot for Earth Science will also yield differentiation. Teachers are eager to 
showcase their own talents and will have opportunities to work with their colleagues so that they can expand each 
others pedagogical skills, and to deepen their understanding. Targeted PD offerings will offered for administration via 
NYCLA (New York City Leadership Academy) in addition to support from KHCC (Kingsbridge Heights Community 
Center) and Ramapo - Restorative Justice. Teachers will also take college level courses and p-credit courses to 
improve practices offered via CITE and/or CTE, UFT.

4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
This year a PD Committee, UFT Consultancy, and MOSL committees were formed to research the various assessments 
available and professional development was provided to provide a clear and thorough knowledge of the assessments 
available. Teachers and administration will utilize the results of the assessment results to drive the professional 
development offerings, and to create a bridge between the known and the unknown regarding student performance. 
Administration participated with the staff in the selection of assessments and the development of ongoing 
assessment. New Visions' Affinity Group has provided the school with the A2I and G2I curriculum for Integrated 
Algebra and Geometry and this contains both the pre and post assessments. Since the school has selected an 
instructional focus of writing with a sub focus on citing evidence from the text, it aligns with the NYC MOSL of 
argument essay writing. All academic subject areas are focusing on writing and citing evidence. The school continues 
to use Atlas Rubicon for curriculum mapping and the development of units aligned to common core. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Bronx Theatre High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part 
A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy 
to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Bronx Theatre High School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand. 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

Bronx Theatre High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act 
(ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement 
between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by 
Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
 
  Bronx Theatre High School has a Stand-alone English as a new language (ENL) program which 
provides support for our 58 LEP students grades 9-12. We have two 
certified ESL teachers.  One teaches two stand-alone ENL classes per day, and four push in 
classes, while the other is dually certified and teaches at least 1 push in classes.  All classes 
have the appropriate mixture of ENL students with newcomer, developing, and long term levels 
of English proficiency. This schedule satisfies the state's mandated minutes of classroom 
instruction for each level of ENL instruction. The ultimate goal for our Stand-alone ENL 
program is to promote proficiency in academic English in ENL student’s core classes so that 
they succeed both in their core classes and the corresponding regents exams. We also prepare 
students for college readiness through instruction using Common Core State Standards. 
Most LEP students at 10X546 have a home language of Spanish with the exception of two 
students who speak Fulani at home and one student who speaks French. Our free-
standing ESL instruction focuses on advancing critical thinking skills (Bloom’s Taxonomy), 
vocabulary acquisition (TPR and language experience, synonym word spectrums), reading skills 
and strategies for varied genres, grammar patterns through language experience and authentic 
activities and MEAL paragraph and essay writing.  
 
Our Title III program will focus on an after-school/Saturday extended learning opportunity for 
English Language Learners that will allow students support in ELA. The rationale for these 
classes is to provide ENL students with opportunities to build their vocabulary and evidence with 
the imagery that is focus on their community, lives, and culture and expand their critical thinking 
through logical thinking.    
 
The ENL after-school/Saturday academy Title III program will meet two days per week and 
every Saturday from November 7, 2018 through May 30, 2019.  The Title III after-school 
program will consists of supplemental instructions in art teacher and ENL teacher, a total of 54 
hours for each teacher.   Achieve 3000 software costing 7,000 will be used during Stand Alone 
Classes, 3 days per week.   
A total of 2 ESL teachers  will participate in the Title III Plan. The following list the teacher’s 
title, and certifications: 
4 NYS ELA Teacher certified  (9-12) 
1 ESL Teacher, ESL (k-12) 
 
Students in Stand alone ESL classes will utilize  online software Achieve 3000 resources  2 days 
per week.  Each student will need a laptop in order to utilize the software.

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
The rationale for our professional development for this program is the strong need to incorporate 
more strategies for ENLs that deal directly with Common Core State Standards in our 
mainstream core classes. Our ENL population is taught the core curriculum in mainstream 
classes without the advantage of an ENL teacher pushing-in to the classroom. Therefore, there is 
a strong need for teachers to be trained in QTEL, and SIOP Methods. Our ENL teachers will 
attend a series of Workshops provided by Center of Applied Linguistics (CAL), QTEL, and NYS 
BETAC, and will turn key the training in the classroom since the teacher is acting as a push-in.   
 
SIOP is a framework for planning and delivering instruction in the areas of science, mathematics, 
and history to English Language Learners as well as other students. Teachers will be able to 
identify learning and instructional strategies, incorporate SIOP in the lesson, and use techniques 
to review content and assess student understanding that is appropriate for English Language 
Learners. 
 
ENL Teachers and school administrator will be participating in SIOP Training for Teachers 
Virtual Professional Development over the course of 4 weeks at a total cost of $900. As for 
QTEL, Staff will be invited to attend the summer institute Building the Base, Secondary and 
Leadership  to support accelerated, quality education for English Language Learner and all 
students. This will be at no cost to the program.  The other teachers will be received professional 
development from the ENL teachers and school administrator overt th course of 5 months.   The 
school administrator will be responsible for coordinating and maintaining agendas and 
attendance sheets at the end of the month.  Teachers participating in the Title III program will be 
given opportunities to attend several SIOP workshops after-school when the program is not in 
session.  This will very likely coincide with Chancellor’s Day or during college visits.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   

  how parents will be notified of these activities 

Begin description here:            
The parent engagement activities for the Title III after school /Saturday program will consist of 
three meetings with parents and students at the school. These meetings will take place five times 
between October and May and will last for two hours each. This will account for five per session 
hours from the overall budget and will be counted as direct instruction. Snacks and refreshments 
will be provided during for each event, which will cost $250.00.   The certified guidance 
counselor, Ms. Scanga, will help parents and students learn about college and financial aid 
planning. In addition, the ESL teacher and/or ENL Coordinator will suggest college materials, 
help parents and students identify resources that include scholarship programs and outside 
support for Spanish speaking and other native languages. The rationale behind this parent 
involvement activity is to increase parental involvement in college planning,  and raise 
awareness of opportunities for ENL students and their families. The students are expected to 
apply to 4 CUNY colleges, 4 SUNY Colleges, and 2 private universities.  There will be 
opportunities for students to take the TOEFL in their native language so they can meet the 
college admission requirements. Students and parents will be provided metro cards while 
attending the event.  All students will be given opportunities to visit CUNY /SUNY 2 
community colleges, and 2 senior colleges.   Public transportation will be used to visit 
CUNY/SUNY Colleges.  The parent event will be available in English and Spanish with all 
handouts translated into Spanish.  Parents will be notified by letters, school’s newsletter, phone 
calls, and school website.  Staff will be required to submit an agenda, attendance sheet, and 
invitations in parents’ preferred language to the school administration no later than 5 days after 
the event.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The data our school uses to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs includes data from the NYSITELL (LAB-R), NYSESLAT exams 
as well as ELA Regents data, and teacher portfolios. This data has revealed that 85% of our ELLs need assistnace with content 
area vocabulary; academic language structure, i.e., argumentative writing, and reading comprehension. We are using this data 
to create an instructional focus on supporting ELLs with on-demand writing. Teachers are examining the problematic areas of 
the ELA Regents and are targeting their instruction around those areas, i.e., creating thesis statements, organizing an 
argument, etc. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

All ENL students receive after school enrichment services from a certified ESL teacher.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs by measuring the ELL success rate on all Regents exams, meeting AYP, 
college readiness data such as SAT scores, performance on AP exams and college level classes, school scholarship data and 
student credit accrual rate, attendance and student feedback.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

We currently have an inquiry approach at the grade level teams where teachers view the student work as the data and identify 
actionable feedback for teachers to support the student's academic growth in the classroom. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data from the 2015 NYSESLAT indicates that all of the students performed poorly on the writing section.  Students that 
were at the advance level in 2014 are now scoring at the emerging or transitioning level on the 2015 NYSESLAT.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Sixty five percent (65%) of the ELL population tested during the Spring 2017 administration of the NYSESLAT. From that group 
seventy four percent (74%) showed an increase in language levels, which includes students who are dually certified Special 
Needs and ELL. In addition, fourty seven percent (47%) of the students that tested achieved COMMANDING Levels.  

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The school offers stand-alone ENL and push-in ENL in math, history and ELA.   The stand-alone classes are 
heterogeneous by grade and level.  Higher level students are able to support their peers who are at the entering level 
of English language proficiency.   In the push-in classes, the ESL teachers support ELL students in collaboration with 
general education classroom teachers to provide language acquistion and vocabulary support. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           The program committee oversees that the school ensures the mandated number of instruction mintues is provided 
according to the student's proficiency level for each model.   This team will review each student's program and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

make  recommendation to the programming team and what steps need to be taken to ensure students are being served. 
Based on the five new proficiency levels, students in grades 9 - 12 will be programmed for over the required minutes of ENL a 
week:  Beginner/ Entering will receive 675 minutes, one stand alone class and two push-in classes.  Low 
Intermediate/Emerging will receive 450 minutes, one stand alone and one push-in class.  Intermediate/Transitioning and 
Advanced/Expanding students will receive 225 minutes, one push-in ENL class.    
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   All ESL curriculua are CCLS aligned and focus on both fiction and non-fiction texts. Our current ELL data reveals that ELL 
students struggle most with science and social studies. Due to this need the amount of non-fiction science and social studies 
based texts has been increased in the ESL curriculua. Instructional approaches used to scaffold the curricula includes think-
pair-share, backwards analysis, graphic organizers, task analysis, vocabulary building strategies, annotation and Cornell note-
taking.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   The ESL coordinator evaluates the level of literacy in the students’ home language by administering the Spanish LAB if 
students are newly matriculated into the NYC DOE and scores are then recorded. If students are not new to the NYC DOE, the 
Spanish LAB is administered for reference only and to evaluate the student’s home language literacy skills against the correct 
answers on the test.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Our instructional plan for our three ELL students combines explicit grammar instruction such as conjugating verbs/verb tense 
study, workbook publications for sentence building such as Side-By-Side. Differentiated worksheets in content courses. 
Reading material that is at their reading level but not made for children such as graphic novels and plays. Higher order thinking 
skills are promoted at every turn through graphic organizers, sentence building templates and evaluating subject/theme. The 
certified ESL teacher and content teachers gear SIFE instruction to fit the actual age and emotional development of the 
student. For example the certified ESL teacher teaches SIFE student who require explicit alphabet instruction by making 
picture dictionarys. Therefore, vocabulary acquisition is driven by student interest using photos from the internet instead of 
books for pre-school children. Students are encouraged to take part in our theatre courses which inherently incorporate ELLs 
teaching methods such as TPR, exaggerated enunciation and repetition. SIFE students are also closely monitored for study 
habits and personal organization skills. SIFE students are closely monitored for homework completion in all classes. All 
teachers have a strong outreach plan for parents of SIFE students. Anacdotal logs in Skedula are utilized often to trouble shoot 
and to monitor SIFE student progress.  Former ELLS are placed in one push-in ENL class which results in 225 minutes of support 
a week.    
  
Our plan for ELLs in US schools for less than three years varies depending on their Spanish Lab scores and the quality of the 
education they have already received in their country of origin. Some students who have explicit knowledge of grammar rules 
in their own country are easily able to generalize those rules to the English language with few adjustments. These students 
with a strong educational base in their home language receive instruction with an emphasis on content and academic 
vocabulary as well as language functions necessary to become college ready, successfully pass content courses and 
successfully pass all regents exams. Other students who have not received a strong educational base in their home language 
will be instructed in a similar fasion to the SIFE students. 
  
Students receiving 4-6 years on ESL services able to take on more difficult challenges than the students who have only been in 
the country for 1-3 years. We use techniques such as goal setting, challenge them to take part in theatre productions, and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

attend afterschool tutoring for regents and college prep. These students are encouraged to stretch out of their comfort zone. 
There is a high expectation that their English language proficiency can really advance at a much quicker pace.  Their silent 
period should be over, they have enough explicit grammar lessons to edit work in other dialects or students on a lower 
proficiency level. As we are a Theatre High School our curriculum is Literature heavy and ELL students especially with 4-6 years 
of service are highly motivated by dramatic literature. We have working relationship with a Broadway theater company which 
comes in and does hands-on workshops that connect students to author purpose and script analysis. These skills are a basis for 
critical thinking and lanugage functions across the curriculum. Students in 4-6 years of service are encouraged to find a 
purpose for learning English so that their journey can become more independent but equally dynamic. These years are seen as 
transition years so that students can really start using skills and strategies they have aquired through ESL instruction such as 
prereading, wordstudy and analysis in order to be more active and influential participants in their learning community. 
  
Long term ELLs needs are accessed and addressed on an individual basis. A range of approaches is used from explicit grammar 
instruction, TPR, to individual interviews to enliven student motivation for learning English. Parent outreach is important for 
long term ELLs especially if truancy has been an issue in the past that has lead to the lack of advancement in proficiency levels. 
A lot of structure and modeling is given to long term ELLs especially for essay writing which is necessary to becoming college 
ready and passing the regents exams. 
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
All Bronx Theatre High School teachers have daily common planning periods to, trouble shoot and discuss appropriate 
differentiation strategies and the use of scaffolding to ensure the advancement of our ELL-SWD’s population. Grade-level 
material is available in students’ home language and  appropriate for content that should be mastered during the 9th, 10th, 
11th and 12th grade year to ensure mastery of material required to pass all regents courses, master Common Core Standards 
and become college ready. Grade level meetings for teachers ensure that skills and learning strategies are reinforced across 
the curriculum.  Cornell-notes, consistent graphic organizers and concept maps are used in all classrooms at Bronx 
Theatre.  Literacy team meets once a week to reinforce school-wide reading strategies. Previewing, annotating and summary 
are used in all content courses as the standard for independent reading practice. Juicy sentences in non-fiction reading are 
selected by students and broken down for meaning and relation to the over-all theme in all content courses. All students read 
literature that accompanies two 11th grade student plays which is reinforced when students either participate in or watch the 
play, discuss it and write essays about it. Theatre is an effective learning tool for ELL-SWD’s as they  tend to be visceral 
learners. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Bronx Theatre High school engages ELL-SWDs in a variety of settings to meet mandated service hour requirements for students 
who receive both ESL services in addition to their Special Education services . We have an adequate number of CTT courses 
where ESL students with IEP’s are co-taught by a certified ESL teacher and a content teacher with an extension in Special 
Education where needed. We have a flexible schedule where we schedule students from period 1-10. Therefore, we are able 
to provide students with additional help on courses where they have not met standards from the previous year, without 
interfering with their current grade-level courses. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Our target intervention program focuses on our long term ELLs who are not meeting goals of passing regents exams across the 
curriculum nor advancing NYSESLAT scores. Repeater classes taught by certified teachers in all content areas are offered 
during regularly scheduled school hours and focus on scaffolding curriculum with graphic organizers, think-pair-share, and 
backwards analysis (modeling). A connection with real life application for each content area is stressed. These classes are 
geared to long term ELLs however ELLs with1-3 years of service across proficiency levels will benefit from these intervention 
courses as well.  Many of our students are bilingual in Spanish and can offer ELLs added home language support. The Title III 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

moneys are also used to offer intervention services for ELLs who want to meet personal goals or who are struggling with 
academic language. The science, math and ESL teacher are available for small group tutoring after school through Title III 
tutoring hours.  Museum, college visits and trips to Broadway plays are made available to all ELLs and are used as motivational, 
hands-on and real world tools that add to our curriculm here at Bronx Theatre. :    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Improvements in our program happen every year. We have implemented common preperation periods this year where the ESL 
teacher can plan differentiation and ESL strategies to enhance in ELA courses.  In addition, we hope to offer additioanl credit 
accumulation opportunities in the areas of science and math. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

   N/A. We are Free Standing Model.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
We offer sports, chorus, dance team, and service learning after school hours. All programs are made available to ELLs through 
translated letters and telephone conversations as needed. At college night there are bilingual staff who make themselves 
available for translation so that Spanish speaking parents can also learn about college and scholarship opportunities afforded 
the entire school population. We also offer several repeater courses after school which help students who take ESL during the 
day to gain all of their credits and to graduate on time.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
PLATO is available and used for ELLs. Laptops are also available to all students in their content classrooms.  Up to date text 
books in English and in Spanish are available in content courses. English/Spanish, Afrikkan, Arabic, and Tigrinya glossaries are 
available for everyday classroom use as well as mandated accomodation during Regents testing.  Smartboards are available in 
all the classroom.    Standards and become college ready. Grade level meetings for teachers ensure that skills and learning 
strategies are reinforced across the curriculum.  Cornell-notes, consistent graphic organizers and concept maps are used in all 
classrooms at Bronx Theatre.  Literacy team meets once a week to reinforce school-wide reading strategies. Previewing, 
annotating and summary are used in all content courses as the standard for independent reading practice. Juicy sentences in 
non-fiction reading are selected by students and broken down for meaning and relation to the over-all theme in all content 
courses. All students read literature that accompanies two 11th grade student plays which is reinforced when students either 
participate in or watch the play, discuss it and write essays about it. Theatre is an effective learning tool for ELL-SWD’s as 
they  tend to be visceral learners. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support in our free standing ESL program is offered through text books in each content area, Spanish 
literature in classroom libraries at all levels, NYC DOE glossaries in English and home language for all regents exams, 
Spanish/English dicitonaries for ELL use in classrooms, bilingual staff (including all school aids), Spanish and AP Spanish courses 
offered. One of the ESL teacher is bilingual and posses dual certification (ESL-Spanish Teacher) where they are able to provide 
entry points for beginner students in Spanish needed. The other ESL teacher is mono-lingual (English) and is successful with 
supporting all ESL students using ESL methodology in the classroom.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Required services and resources are age and grade level appropriate based on the results of the NYSESLAT and/or NYSITELL.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
PLATO is available and used for ELLs. Laptops are also available to all students in their content classrooms.  Up to date texts 
books in English and in Spanish are available in content courses. English/Spanish, Afrikkan, Arabic, and Tigrinya glossaries are 
available for everyday classroom use as well as mandated accomodation during Regents testing.  Smartboards are available in 
all the classroom. The campus has a fully functional library where our ELL students have access as needed.    

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
There is an orientation that students and parents come to for a two day period that culminates in a staged production that 
family and friends are invited to watch. Students are visited by upper classmen and staff to ensure a smooth and welcoming 
transition into high school. Newly enrolled ELLs are also assigned a buddy in their own grade and an upper classman during 
orientation who is responsible for translating and helping the student to adjust to the demands of high school.  In addition, the 
school hosts a luncheon for all ELL students in the month of Septmeber where they get a chance to meet and interact with 
their peers outside of classroom setting.  This is coordinated by the AP, and the ESL coordinator. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish (both A.P. and general) are offered at Bronx Theatre H.S.. Since the entire ELL's population speaks Spanish at home all 
are encouraged from freshmen year to take AP Spanish by graduation. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A 
 

 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Our ESL Coordinator/teacher will provide professional development sessions for all staff.  The focus of these sessions will be 
strategies and skills for reading and writing on demand.Professional development is offered to teachers of ELLS  in weekly 
department meetings focusing on deconstructing the common core, lesson study and curriculum study, inter-visitations, 
supplementary materials such as Engage NY, and observational feedback and support. ESL teachers and content teachers 
receive professional development on CCSS-related collaboration, instruction, and teacher evaluation. The ESL teacher and 
content area teacher collaborate on writing CCSS based lesson plans that are scaffolded for ELLs. The ESL teacher support 
content teachers as they carried out the lesson plans and provide feedback on how it worked with ELLs. These Professional 
developments provide teachers authentic activities, examples and modeling of effective strategies to enable them to support 
ELs within the CCSS framework.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Support provided to staff to assist the transition of ELLs as they transition includes bi-level grade level meetings for teachers of 
9th grade students, information and support from the SIT team and PPT team members (of which the ESL teacher is a 
member). To meet the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2, all teachers will be provided training in 
instructional strategies of language development.  For the 2017-2018 school year,  professional development for all staff is 
held from 3 PM to 4:20 PM (Mondays).  The ESL coordinator and ESL teacher will attend PD in the areas of language acquisition 
and integrating language and content instruction that are offered externally (New Visions - Affinity Group - Central). ESL 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

 

Teacher that attend external professional development are expected to turnkey the information to the school community. All 
records of attendance and agenda will be recorded and filed with the principal. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The guidance counselor, parent coordinator and ESL teachers meet with the parents or guardians of English language learners 
at least once a year, in addition to parent-teacher conferences, initial parent orientations, quarterly progress meetings or 
other scheduled meetings provided for parents or guardians, to discuss the goals of the program, their child’s language 
development progress, their child’s English language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all 
content areas. This additional meeting includes the school staff who teach the student and are able to inform the parent or 
guardian about the child’s language development in all content areas.  Such a meeting is conducted with a qualified 
interpreter/translator in the language or mode of communication the parent or guardian best understands. Schools must 
determine the manner and form of such individual parent meetings, in accordance with collective bargaining agreements. A 
record of attendance is placed in the child's cumulative record.            

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Our parent coordinator (PC) promotes parental involvment and provides translation services as needed.  In addition, our 
guidance counselor is bilingual (Spanish - English) as well as other staff members.  The PC is available during the school day and

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Daniel Albetta, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

Coordinator? Yes/No  

 

 

 

 
* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The HLIS, ATS records (RHLA) and Emergency Contact Cards are used to determine home languages in order to 
ensure proper written and oral translation is provided for homes in which English is not the primary language. The 
data has shown that Spanish is the preferred language for our ELL parents. This data is maintained and updated 
throughout the school year by our pupil personnel secretary and our parent coordinator, in conjunction with our 
ESL Coordinator. In addition, Emergency cards are used to review the home language. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

as French. This information has been 
shared with our school community via 
meetings and consistent communication 
between teachers, the Parent 
Coordinator, the ELL Coordinator, and 
the home. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.

Our school uses parent surveys, open meetings, and scheduled parent discussions. In addition, the parent coordinator 
is scheduling a focus group of parents that is inclusive of all cultures and languages represented in our school to 
gather feedback.
