Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

It is our mission to produce student achievers who are set on the path of lifelong learning and enjoy the process. We

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Asa Philip Randolph, P.S./I.S 76, is a school striving for academic excellence for all students. Our teaching staff is a 
vibrant mix of young and experienced teachers from diverse backgrounds, all of whom are fully committed to the 
academic growth and well being of our students. Additionally, the many cultural institutions of New York City are used 
to magnify our students’ learning experiences. Parents appreciate our use of data to drive and differentiate the 
instruction to meet individual student needs. Students are challenged to explore their individual learning styles and 
set goals that will allow them to meet their full potential.  

Our school environment encourages self-respect and self-awareness from the collective effort and cooperation of our 
parents, teachers, staff, and community. We will prepare all of our children for life now and for the technological 
demands of the future with the expectation of their being fully prepared to be participants in this ever-evolving 
century. 
 
The instructional leadership of our educational community is one with a vision that understands the cognitive and 
effective processes of children. Our instructional leadership respects and nurtures the multiple intelligences of our 
students. Our resources and finances are aligned to enrich professional development, curriculum and instruction, 
teaching and learning, parental involvement, and support services – all for the improvement of student performance 
and social development. We envision a performance-standards driven school in a nurturing and safe environment 
where all children are held to high expectations and one that enables children to reach their greatest potentials. That 
said, the vision of Asa Philip Randolph - P.S. / I.S. 76 reflects our belief that whether students are identified as regular 
education students, Students with Disabilities, English Language Learners, high/low achievers, they are all entitled to a 
"standards-based" education that will result in their being able to read and solve problems analytically and critically, 
without exception. The materials and resources utilized in our instructional programs will be developmentally 
appropriate and accessible through a multiplicity of modalities. 

Asa Philip Randolph - P.S. / I.S. 76 enjoys collaboration with multiple community based organizations including: 
Harlem Children's Zone, Harlem Hospital Community Health Education and Outreach Department, The Carmel Hill 
Fund/Accelerated Reader Program, The Institute for Urban and Minority Education (IUME) @ Teacher's College, The 
Administration for Children's Services Neighborhood Network Providers, Insights @ New York University, Project Eye 
2 Eye, Center Care, IAM (Incorporation of Artists on the Move), The Leadership Program, America Reads with 
Columbia University, and Harlem Commonwealth's After School STEM Program. These agencies provide ongoing 
parent outreach and support, counseling and medical services, student tutoring, violence prevention, and much more. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Student Demographics  

Our school has 42 current English Language Learners (ELLs), who make up 8.27% of our student population.  

Students with Special Needs 18.5%. The largest subgroups of ELLs are long term and/or have an IEP. There are many 
other former ELLs and IEP students across classrooms. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

PS/IS 76 Areas of Celebration  

Through the collaborative effort of all in our school community, we have lots to celebrate! Our instructional practices 
include some of the following highlights: 

  A culture of trust and respect where students are well known by the staff and targeted supports are provided 

to align with students’ learning needs and experiences  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

  Utilization of the Danielson Framework to consistently provide teachers with effective feedback that 

influences the professional development to further elevate school-wide instructional practices and improved 
student outcomes  

  Engaging students in rigorous and varied learning tasks 
  Designing coherent curricula aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards 
  Aligned use of resources to support instructional goals that meet students’ needs 
 

Structure and policies in place conducive to a positive learning environment, inclusive culture, and student 
success

PS/IS76 Areas in Need of Improvement 

With the goal of improving student outcomes, we have conducted a needs assessment and have found some areas in 
need of improvement in our school practices including: 

The element of the Framework for Great Schools which PS/IS 76 identifies as its key area of focus is Rigorous 
Instruction. A review and analysis of teachers’ MOTP tracker performance over the past 2 years (2016-2017 and 2017-
2018) reflect teachers’ continuing challenge in Advance components 3c and 3d. Fewer teachers improved 
performance in these components, with teachers either remaining at their same level or declining in their ratings. Last 
year, ten out of 28 teachers receiving lower than Effective ratings in either 3c and/or 3d. 

Two teachers received a Highly Effective rating in Instructional Domain 3, in one of the components of 3b, 3c, or 3d.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, the Framework Element score for Rigorous Instruction is 4.06, 
reflecting an improvement from last year's score of 2.95. 

According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, the Survey Element score for Rigorous Instruction is 4.24, reflecting 
a slight decline from last year's score of 4.30. 

According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey Measures for Rigorous Instruction, in the area of 
Academic Press, the percent of positive responses is 91%, with a score of 4.99, reflecting 18% above the district 
average and 20% above the city average. 

The school's Quality Review in 2017-2018 indicated that the school needed to focus on aligning assessment to 
curricula, use on-going grading practices, utilizing a data tracking system to track student progress in order to increase 
student mastery and analyze information on student learning outcomes to adjust instructional decisions at the team 
and classroom levels. 

The Principal Performance Observation from November 2017 indicated that the school needs to: 

Ensure teachers are addressing the needs of all students including ELLs and SWDs by ensuring that academic tasks 
strategically provide support within the units and that rubrics are used to assess the curricula and unit plans. 
Administration and teachers should be able to articulate modifications and the reason for the modifications along 
with their impact. 

Teachers need to develop their questioning skills to ensure that all students have an opportunity to think critically and 
engage in rigorous discussions across grade levels. Teachers need to differentiate task, with appropriate scaffolds and 
supports to provide challenging tasks for all students.  

Ensure that the goals and action plans accelerate student learning and teacher practice. The school goals and systems 
for tracking are being utilized to track student progress and ensure the appropriate steps are taken to support 
academic growth. 

Develop a strategic and transparent process through the use of a rubric to closely monitor the effectiveness of the 
curricula and instruction, the professional development, and teacher teamwork. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

The Principal Performance Observation from March 2018 indicated that the school needed to: 

Ensure that the assessment practices are timely and teachers are utilizing the formative and summative data to adjust 
their instruction. Teachers need to frequently provide ongoing checks for understanding, through a variety of 
assessment practices to make effective adjustments to meet all students' learning needs and determine student 
mastery in a subject and/or skill.  

Provide professional development on utilizing data to make adjustments and provide targeted feedback. Targeted 
Feedback should reflect successes or challenges demonstrated by students as well as allowing students to self assess.  

Set up 1:1 data meetings with each teacher to review student progress and class data and identify supports and next 
steps that can be provided within the classroom. 

PS/IS 76 evaluated student assessment data from last year (including state assessment results, guided reading levels, 
and classroom assessments) and concluded that school leaders and instructional staff need to align formal and 
informal assessment practices in order to improve student achievement as well as strengthen teacher practices across 
every grade level. 

The June 2018 Instructional Report explained which standards student mastered and which standards needed more 
attention. 

Upon review, we found a 22% deficit between our students total possible points and the total city's possible points in 
Math 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, as a result of all teachers planning for and implementing Making Thinking Visible strategies and building 
student engagement with CCLS-aligned tasks and curricula on a daily basis, we will close the gap between the school's 
and the city's average possible points on the New York State Math Exam, overall by 11%, as evidenced by June Math 
2019 Instructional Report.

The overall percentage of students meeting CCLS (Tier 1), as indicated IReady math diagnostic assessments is 13%. 
We have not met our February progress monitoring goal of at least 18% of students meeting CCLS (Tier 1), with 
ratings of "on grade level." 

Our next CEP action steps include the following: 

The school leaders will use a school-developed, informal walkthrough feedback form to provide all teachers feedback 
related to mathematical practices in instruction at least 2 times per week, in addition to the formal observations done 
through Advance.  

Instructional support personnel from the Manhattan Borough Office, in conjunction with school leaders engage in 
Instructional Rounds through cycles of joint visits to visit classes and debrief to plan for ongoing next instructional and 
supervisory steps.  

Math consultants provide targeted professional development to teachers through class visits, debriefing sessions, 
modeling, and intervisitations, and workshops. 

 

 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January 
Regents, etc.)

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
We believe that building a strong sense of school culture and community are essential in helping students be 
successful in school. An integral part of a student's academic success is deeply tied to their attendance and 
participation in school. 

According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey Measures for Supportive Environment, in the 
area of Classroom Behavior, the percent of positive responses is 86%, with a score of 4.99, reflecting 19% above the 
district average and 27% above the city average. 

According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, the Survey Element score for Supportive Environment is 4.56, 
reflecting a slight decline from last year's score of 4.60. 

A review of ATS reports reveals that: 

During the period of September 2017-December 2017, the average monthly attendance percentage was 90%. During 
the period of January 2018 - June 2018, the average monthly attendance percentage was 89% On half days, our 
attendance rate drops to 60%. 

Areas of Strength: 

The attendance team meets weekly to conference about student attendance concerns. We communicate 
expectations for attendance to parents through the Jupiter Grades system, Class Dojo, Kinvolve and progress reports 
for all grade levels. We conference with students about their daily attendance and monitor lateness and absenteeism. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this

By February 2019, there will be a monthly average attendance rate of 92%, as measured by ATS RYMA report 
between September 2018 and February 2019. 

A review of the ATS RYMA report for the period of September 2018 to February 2019 reveals the following: 

Between September 2018 and January 2019, the average monthly attendance rate was 88.2%. 

We have not met our February 2019 progress monitoring goal of achieving a monthly average attendance rate of 
92%.  

Our next CEP action steps will include the following: 

Personnel will be trained in using the chronic absentee tool to effectively track students and address issues related to 
excessive absences and latenesses. 

School personnel will meet monthly with district support staff to monitor the progress being made related to the 
attendance data for identified students who have been chronically absent. 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. 
The instrument of measure that will be used to assess progress will be the ATS Monthly RYMA Report.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, the Framework Element score for Collaborative Teachers is 3.66, 
reflecting the same score from last year. 

According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, the Survey Element score for Collaborative Teachers is 3.81, 
reflecting a slight decline from last year's score of 3.82. 

According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey Measures for Collaborative Teachers, in the area 
of Cultural Awareness and Inclusive Classroom Instruction, the percent of positive responses is 95%, with a score of 
4.17, reflecting 4% above the district average and 5% above the city average. 

Almost 1/3 of all teachers received a lower than Effective rating in component 3c and/or 3d (Advance MOTP results 
2017-2018), reflecting a great need to enhance and strengthen the consistency and level of rigor and engagement in 
classrooms and effectively assess students’ learning on an ongoing basis.  

The school's Quality Review in 2017-2018 indicated that the school needed to focus on aligning assessment to 
curricula, use on-going grading practices, utilizing a data tracking system to track student progress in order to increase 
student mastery and analyze information on student learning outcomes to adjust instructional decisions at the team 
and classroom levels. 

The Principal Performance Observation from November 2017 indicated that the school needs to: 

Ensure teachers are addressing the needs of all students including ENLs and SWDs by ensuring that academic tasks 
strategically provide support within the units and that rubrics are used to assess the curricula and unit plans. 
Administration and teachers should be able to articulate modifications and the reason for the modifications along 
with their impact. 

Teachers need to develop their questioning skills to ensure that all students have an opportunity to think critically and 
engage in rigorous discussions across grade levels. Teachers need to differentiate task, with appropriate scaffolds and 
supports to provide challenging tasks for all students.  

Ensure that the goals and action plans accelerate student learning and teacher practice. The school goals and systems 
for tracking are being utilized to track student progress and ensure the appropriate steps are taken to support 
academic growth. 

Develop a strategic and transparent process through the use of a rubric to closely monitor the effectiveness of the 
curricula and instruction, the professional development, and teacher teamwork. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          23 

 

The Principal Performance Observation from March 2018 indicated that the school needed to: 

Ensure that the assessment practices are timely and teachers are utilizing the formative and summative data to adjust 
their instruction. Teachers need to frequently provide ongoing checks for understanding, through a variety of 
assessment practices to make effective adjustments to meet all students' learning needs and determine student 
mastery in a subject and/or skill.  

Provide professional development on utilizing data to make adjustments and provide targeted feedback. Targeted 
Feedback should reflect successes or challenges demonstrated by students as well as allowing students to self assess.  

Set up 1:1 data meetings with each teacher to review student progress and class data and identify supports and next 
steps that can be provided within the classroom. 

PS/IS 76 evaluated student assessment data from last year (including state assessment results, guided reading levels, 
and classroom assessments) and concluded that school leaders and instructional staff need to align formal and 
informal assessment practices in order to improve student achievement as well as strengthen teacher practices across 
every grade level. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, as a result of all teachers participating in collaborative inquiry cycles to revise and implement CCLS 
curricula to include multiple entry points and differentiated strategies to meet the needs of all students, 90% of 
teachers will receive ratings of Effective and/or Highly Effective, as measured by Advance observation reports, in 
component 3c.

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, the Framework Element score for Effective School Leadership is 
3.86, reflecting a decline from last year's score of 4.02. 

According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, the Survey Element score for Collaborative Teachers is 3.65, 
reflecting a decline from last year's score of 4.02. 

According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey Measures for Effective School Leadership, in the 
area of Instructional Leadership, the percent of positive responses is 92%, with a score of 3.80, reflecting 8% above 
the district average and 6% above the city average. 

Almost 1/3 of all teachers received a lower than Effective rating in component 3c and/or 3d (Advance MOTP results 
2017-2018), reflecting a great need to enhance and strengthen the consistency and level of rigor and engagement in 
classrooms and effectively assess students’ learning on an ongoing basis.  

The school's Quality Review in 2017-2018 indicated that the school needed to focus on aligning assessment to 
curricula, use on-going grading practices, utilizing a data tracking system to track student progress in order to increase 
student mastery and analyze information on student learning outcomes to adjust instructional decisions at the team 
and classroom levels. 

The Principal Performance Observation from November 2017 indicated that the school needs to: 

Ensure teachers are addressing the needs of all students including ENLs and SWDs by ensuring that academic tasks 
strategically provide support within the units and that rubrics are used to assess the curricula and unit plans. 
Administration and teachers should be able to articulate modifications and the reason for the modifications along 
with their impact. 

Teachers need to develop their questioning skills to ensure that all students have an opportunity to think critically and 
engage in rigorous discussions across grade levels. Teachers need to differentiate task, with appropriate scaffolds and 
supports to provide challenging tasks for all students.  

Ensure that the goals and action plans accelerate student learning and teacher practice. The school goals and systems 
for tracking are being utilized to track student progress and ensure the appropriate steps are taken to support 
academic growth. 

Develop a strategic and transparent process through the use of a rubric to closely monitor the effectiveness of the 
curricula and instruction, the professional development, and teacher teamwork.

The Principal Performance Observation from March 2018 indicated that the school needed to: 

Ensure that the assessment practices are timely and teachers are utilizing the formative and summative data to adjust 
their instruction. Teachers need to frequently provide ongoing checks for understanding, through a variety of 
assessment practices to make effective adjustments to meet all students' learning needs and determine student 
mastery in a subject and/or skill.  

Provide professional development on utilizing data to make adjustments and provide targeted feedback. Targeted 
Feedback should reflect successes or challenges demonstrated by students as well as allowing students to self assess.  

Set up 1:1 data meetings with each teacher to review student progress and class data and identify supports and next 
steps that can be provided within the classroom. 

PS/IS 76 evaluated student assessment data from last year (including state assessment results, guided reading levels, 
and classroom assessments) and concluded that school leaders and instructional staff need to align formal and 
informal assessment practices in order to improve student achievement as well as strengthen teacher practices across 
every grade level. 

In component 3b (2017-2018): 

0 teachers scored in range of 4; 18 teachers scored in range of 3; 10 teachers scored in range of 2; 0 teachers scored 
in range of 1 

For component 3c (2017-2018) 

0 teachers scored in range of 4; 19 teachers scored in range of 3; 9 teachers scored in range of 2; 0 teachers scored in

Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, as a result of all teachers implementing a range of effective formative and summative assessments and 
providing effective feedback to students on a daily basis, 90% of teachers will receive ratings of Effective and/or Highly 
Effective, as measured by Advance observation reports, in component 3d.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
By February 2019, 89% of teachers will receive at least a rating of Effective and/or Highly Effective, with an average 
score of above 2.5 in component 3d, as measured by a number of completed Advance observation reports between 
September 2018 and February 2019. 

A review of the Advance Teacher Level MOTP Detail Report reveals the following: 

Out of 27 teachers, 22 teachers received at least one MOTP rating of Effective or Highly Effective in component 3d 
(81%). Out of 27 teachers, 21 teachers achieved an average rating of at least 2.5 in component 3d (77.8%). 

We have not met our February 2019 progress monitoring goal of 89% of teachers receiving a rating of Effective or 
Highly Effective with a score above 2.5 in component 3d, between September 2018 and February 2019. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          31

We will use Kinvolved to increase parent teacher 
teacher conference attendance by emailing and/or 
texting time and date of parent teacher conference two 
weeks prior as well as the night before.  

We will actively seek new partners that will provide 
additional after school and weekend programs. The 
partnerships will provide materials and training to help 
parents work with their children to improve their 
achievement levels throughout the content areas 
including: literacy, math, science and use of technology 
as result of conferences held at parent teacher 
conferences. 

We will provide parents with the information and 
workshops needed to effectively become involved in 
planning and decision making in support of the HS 
enrollment process and the education of their children 
including subgroups such as Students with Disabilities 
(SWDs) and English as Second Language (ESL) students. 

Make improvements to protocol used for and data 
tracking of Parent Outreach Tuesdays in order to make 
sure that parents are aware of parent teacher 
conferences dates  

We will utilize multiple means of communicating with 
families and the community including: Kinvolve, Class 
Dojo, notices, phone calls, invitations to attend school 
events, emails, scheduled meetings as well as the 
purposeful use of weekly planned parent engagement 
block in order to increase parent teacher conference 
attendance.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
By March 2019, there will be a 8% increase in the number of parents and families who attend parent teacher 
conferences, as measured by the Parent Teacher Conference Attendance Report between November 2018 and March 
2019. This report will be compared to the 72% Parent Teacher Conference Attendance Report between November 
2017 and March 2018. 

A review of the Parent Coordinator Activity Report for the period of November 2017 reveals that 300 parents 
attended parent teacher conferences. A review of the Parent Coordinator Activity Report for the period of November 
2018 reveals that 275 parents attended parent teacher conferences. This reflects a decrease of 25 parents. The 
extreme weather conditions during the November 2018 conferences significantly contributed to this decline in the 
number of parents attending the conferences. 

As of February 2019, we did not meet the February progress monitoring goal. Further progress monitoring in March 
will be conducted to determine the progress being made towards achieving the June 2019 annual goal of the number 
of parents attending parent teacher conferences increasing from 72% to 80%, as measured by the 2018-2019 Parent

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement.

Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

PS/IS 76’s Parent Involvement Policy is designed to keep parents informed and actively participating in the planning 
and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Educational research shows a positive correlation 
between effective parental involvement and student achievement. The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent 
involvement program that will ensure consistent involvement of parents and the community in our school. Therefore, 

 

PS/IS 76,  

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for 
creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student 
achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by 
actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are 
encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee 
as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS/IS 76 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

  Providing parents with an understanding of parental involvement – Parental Involvement means the 

participation of parents in regular, two-way and meaningful communication involving student academic 
learning and other school activities; 

  Providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, 

e.g., literacy, math and use of technology; such as providing grade specific common core workshops; 

  Providing orientation and transitional support into middle schools; 
  Providing information for Dial-a-Teacher and other external student supports; 
  Providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

decision making in support of the education of their children;

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

PS/IS 76 will celebrate academic achievement, implement test preparation and assessment readiness as well as 
strengthen the school/home/community partnerships through initiatives such as: Curriculum Day/Night(s), Family 
Night(s) (e.g. Game Night, Movie Night, basketball – parents and staff vs. students, Zumba, yoga and nutrition 
classes). 

PS/IS 76’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities. Our 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this Parent Involvement 
Policy with parents to improve the academic quality of our school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents and 
enhance the school’s Title I Program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, PS/IS 76 will: 

 

Involve parents of the PA/PTA on the School Leadership Team (SLT) to participate in school walkthroughs and 
learning walks. This will enable parents to have a better understanding of the school’s operation and how 
needs are assessed for the upcoming school year; 

  Actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 

Title I program as outlined in the Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the

Begin description here:            
The rationale for the Title III program is to provide supplemental enrichment services in English 
for the English Language Learners.  The Program will meet on three days each week 
(Monday,  Tuesday, and Thursday from 4 to 6 p.m.) beginning in mid-November 2018 and 
ending at the end of April 2019.  The program's duration is 22 weeks.  The certified ENL teacher 
works with 30 students grouped according to elementary  (2 through 5)and middle school (6 
through 8).  Each of the groups meet for one hour each of the days in the ENL classroom.  The 
focus is reading and writing development.  The Title III program commences on November 19, 
2018, and continues through May 9, 2019.  
The weekday program uses the themed readers,'Read-Reason-Write, Levels B through 
E,' published by Continental Press, and will be purchased with Title III funds.  The level used 
will correspond with the proficiency levels of students in a group.  The themes and topics of the 
books parallel the core content areas of Math and Social Studies and reinforce academic 
vocabulary.  Our rationale for using these materials is that the graphic organizers/illustrations in 
the books provide excellent scaffolding support for the ELLs to comprehend the subject-
matter, and develop academic English.   It also models for them how to write about complex 
science and social studies ideas.  During this time, the teacher works closely with students, 
providing differentiated instruction to meet their required needs.  The language of instruction is 
English with home language support in French and Spanish, when necessary.  Arabic 
speakers are supported with Arabic-English dictionaries, computer software, such as 'Google 
Translate,' 'Arabic Keyboard.' 
A Math teacher will co-teach with a certified ENL teacher in the Saturday School Program over 
a 12-week period beginning on January 19, 2019 and continuing through April 13, 2019.  The 
students will use the computer-based academic program, 'i-Ready'.  The focus will be on 
Math enrichment for the purpose of reinforcing math concepts and related academic 
language.  We hope that this additional instruction will be beneficial to the ELLs during the state 
tests.

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
This year, P.S./I.S. 76 is using CCLS-aligned ELA and Math Baseline Assessments as a Measure of Students' Learning (MOSL) to 
assess the foundational literacy and math skills of English Language Learners (ELLs) in all grades.  Other assessments used 
throughout the year are Fountas and Pinell, and iReady and IXL in the upper grades.  The ENL teacher administers the NYSITELL 
to all incoming ELLs, and the  NYSESLAT  scores from the previous spring give some indication of students' literacy skills at the 
beginning of the school year. 
 
Results of the MOSL Assessments in the early grades reveal a weakness in "phonemic awareness," "comprehension," and 
"writing" skills in almost all of the students tested.  Results of the NYSITELL demonstrate that entering students have had

either a little or no prior exposure to English.  On several occasions, we have found that a student may have had very little 
exposure to any type of literacy in the home/native  language before enrolling at P.S./I.S. 76.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

All teachers are involved in the assessment process.   The English as a New Language (ENL) teacher in conjunction with the 
School Leadership Team use the data collected from these assessments to determine their specific needs, and to inform 
instruction.   Once areas of need have been identified, we address these through teachers' use of differentiated instruction, 
using Fundations phonemics program (on the early grades), read-alouds, modeling, scaffolding (visual, audio, aural, graphic 
organizers), as well as the Teachers College writing instruction model. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
  
As previously stated, ELLs in Grades K through 8 are being administered the CCLS-aligned Math and ELA Baseline Assessments 
as a Measure of Students' Learning (MOSL) in the Fall and late Spring with the rest of their class.  The upper grade classes will 
also do the computer-based i-ready and IXL baseline assessments in ELA and Math. 
Additionally, all ELLs in grades K-8 will be administered the NYSESLAT during the spring semester to assess student growth 
across the four modalities of Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing.  ELLs in grades 3-8 are administered the ELA, Math and 
Science State Tests (the last, for grades 4 and 8 only).  We look at the scores of the ELLs on all these State assessments in the 
content areas to identify baseline, areas of need, and progress made.  
On the 2016 NYSESLAT, approximately 42 students were administered the test.  Six students scored commanding; 10 advanced 
1 proficiency level; 8 advanced 2 proficiency levels; 2 advanced 3 proficiency levels; and 9 remained at the same proficiency 
level. 
On the 2017 NYSESLAT, approximately 46 students were administered the test.  Students were predominantly Newcomer ELLs 
(0-3 years).  One student scored commanding as she moved on to high school.  Of the remaining 45 students (some of whom 
have also moved elsewhere), 17 advanced at least 1  proficiency level; 24 remain at the same proficiency level; 
and 5 regressed. 
Areas of need on all grades reveal a need for stronger decoding and comprehension skills in reading; while, in writing, there is 
a need for students in the early grades to demonstrate proficiency in writing an informational piece that includes an opinion 
with many and varied reasons and additional information.  Students in the upper grades need to be able to establish a clear 
and credible claim/argument, and maintain a focus throughout in their persuasive/argumentative essays. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The School Leadership Team and the Pupil Personnel Team (PPT) (which includes the ENL teacher) continually review data 
from both formal and informal assessments to identify students who are struggling or academically at risk.  We then use the 
data to guide instruction for ELLs, bearing in mind the need for appropriate scaffolds and other types of differentiated 
instruction that will aid in their comprehension. We also review and analyze student data during our school-wide professional 
development meetings.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
We use the data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-5) by assigning 
students to small groups out of their classrooms to work with the different service providers who are trained to address the 
specific academic skills goals specified on their IEPs, or recommend evaluation for an IEP if the student does not already have 
one.  We know that in order to meet ELLs’ needs in an RtI framework, it is important to understand their characteristics as 
children and learners, and to ensure that we view their status as language learners as an asset to draw upon as well as a 
dynamic developmental process that is inextricably tied to learning opportunities.  They are also taught the general curriculum 
skills required for their grade level, using the components of the Standards Based curriculum, ReadyGen and GoMath that are 
designed specifically for ELLs.            
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
 
We look at the Data Analysis section of the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) to evaluate the performance of the ENL Program and 
the ELL students on the various assessments (NYSESLAT, ELA, Math) and the MOSL to evaluate and inform the ELL 
program.  This information is important to see which students are at risk and for what reasons (e.g. scoring below the 25th 
growth percentile on the ELA and Math, number of years of service, number of years at a particular proficiency level and 
holdovers).  It also informs us about the risk level of each ELL, and compels us to consider how best to meet our students' 
needs. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The ENL teacher shares information gathered from the EDAT with members of the Language Allocation Policy Team (LAP), the 
School Leadership Team and the Pupil Personal Team (PPT) for review, analysis and action.  Data is also shared with classroom 
teachers for their specific ELLs, so that they are knowledgeable about the proficiency levels of the students.  All adjustments to 
the program are made by members  of the LAP team.  Adjustments such as grade clusters, minutes provided, and staffing are 
made by members of the LAP team, where it is feasible.   

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

1a.  P.S./I.S. 76l has a Freestanding English as a New Language program that combines Integrated ENL with Stand-
alone ENL instruction.  Stand-alone ENL is instruction in English with home language support which emphasizes 
English language acquisition, and Integrated ENL is instruction which aims to build English language skills through 
content area instruction.  The former is delivered in the ENL classroom by the certified ENL teacher, while the latter is 
delivered as a co-teaching model with the certified content area teacher (i.e.,  English Language Arts, Math, Science or 
Social Studies) and the certified ENL teacher.  This is in alignment with the CR Part 154.2 mandates.  The ENL program 
services children daily as a part of their language development and academic instruction.  In this program, the ENL 
teacher plans with the content teacher on methods for scaffolding content in the Integrated scenario, and 
also provides ENL instruction in the Stand-alone setting, also aided by the use of various types of scaffolds.  Students 
are serviced within the parameters of their grade clusters whenever possible (i.e., K-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8). All proficiency 
levels are serviced together both in the Integrated classroom and the ENL Stand-alone classroom with differentiated 
instruction provided. 
  
1b.   The ENL program provides services to ELLs in Kindergarten through Eighth Grade.  Students are usually grouped 
according to the following grade clusters:  K-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7, and 8.  However, the number of ELLs registered each year 
on a particular grade may change the group configurations slightly, for example K-2, 3-5 or 6-8.  2017-2018 groupings 
are K-2, 3-5, 6, 7, 8.  The ENL teacher co-teaches in an integrated setting with the ELA teachers in the Middle School 
(Grades 6-8) daily.  There is also some instructional time allotted for mixed groups of 6th through 8th grade students 
at the Entering through Transitioning levels who are serviced in the ENL classroom.  Each week, groups are scheduled 
to meet for between two and seven 54-minute periods, according to their required unit of study for either Stand-
alone ENL, Integrated ENL or a combination of both.  Former ELLs who have attained Commanding (proficient) level 
receive a .5 unit (90 to 108 minutes) of Integrated ENL instruction or other approved former ELL services for two 
additional years.    

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

 

The program helps ELLs to achieve proficiency and reach the standards established for all students for grade 
promotion and graduation.  The primary goal of this program is to assist students in achieving English Language 
proficiency within three years.  Additionally, the goal is to amplify the literacy and academic skills of ELLs who 
participate in this program.  We strive to incorporate recognized and researched based ENL instructional strategies 
across content subject areas and to give students the skills to perform at city and state grade levels in all subject 
areas.  The school directly provides or makes referrals to appropriate support services that may be needed by ELL 
students in order to achieve and maintain a satisfactory level of academic performance.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

P.S./I.S. 76 is a Free-Standing ENL school that uses a Stand-alone/Integrated ENL model.  We are strengthening our ENL 
team through the use of diverse expertise which our international group of teachers bring to the school. We continue to 
encourage our Common Branch teachers to have multiple credentials; either Bilingual/ENL licenses or extensions that would 
offer our school community additional flexibility to meet the needs of our ELLs.  We understand the importance of using the 
multiple human and fiscal resources necessary to accelerate ELLs' academic English language proficiency and content-area 
mastery.    We provide ENL and ELA instructional minutes through both the Stand-alone and the Integrated model.   The ENL 
teacher and the two Middle School ELA teachers collaborate in the Integrated co-teaching model.  In the Elementary school, 
she services all ELLs in the ENL classroom according to the Stand-alone model, for as many of the entitled minutes as 
possible.  We do our best to be in compliance with CR Part 154.2, providing all our students, according to their proficiency 
levels with 90 to 360 minutes a week of Integrated co-teaching, Stand-alone or a combination of both.  Entering and Emerging 
students receive as many of the 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week as possible, while Transitional and Expanding 
students receive 180 minutes.  Commanding students receive the 90 minutes of ENL instruction either as part of the 
Integrated or Stand-Alone model.  Students are grouped within their age-grade parameters.  The program serves all students 
with limited English proficiency (ELLs) until they achieve proficiency in the English language.     
    
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Students of limited English proficiency receive the same academic content as those students who are native English 
speakers.  In order to maximize English language acquisition for ELLs, the ENL and content teacher work closely together to 
deliver literacy instruction, as well as tailor additional content instruction to meet the needs of ELLs.  To help students to 
progress in these programs, we utilize various types of Scaffolding as an essential part of the instructional delivery.  Some 
examples are Modeling, Bridging, Schema Building, Contextualization, Text Representation and Metacognition, Cognate 
Recognition and the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP) model, Language Experience Approach, Read-Alouds, 
Cooperative Learning, Cognitive Academic Language Learning Approach, and Total Physical Response.   
 
In order for the ELLs to meet the demands of the New York State Learning Standards as of May 2017, we utilize collaborative 
planning between ENL, ELA, Math, Social Studies and other teachers for each unit.  Additionally, we strongly encourage target 
language development across the grades and content areas, creating opportunities for active meaningful engagement.  In all 
content areas the teachers are concerned with the language needs of ELLs, modifying their instructional language and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

scaffolding instruction in order to ensure the students' under-standing.  Beyond explicit ENL instruction, collaboration between 
teachers means that there is a consideration for the language needs of ELLs.  For example, content area teachers monitor the 
understanding of linguistically challenging material and use a variety of realia, as well as modified phrasings, synonyms, 
cognate recognition, contextualization and  analogies in order to clarify meaning.  In addition, math teachers devote extra class 
time to untangling difficult word problems.  Social Studies teachers scaffold their instruction with visual aids such as maps, 
atlases, and illustrations, Promethean Board with computers to increase comprehension.  The use of technology is also an 
important component in ENL instruction because of the interactive, multi-sensory nature of language development computer 
software.  
 
The ENL teacher consults the monthly 'Units of Study' for guidelines on the topic being covered in the content areas on each 
grade.  She then collaborates with content and classroom teachers to understand how best to modify and supplement the 
curriculum in accordance with ENL teaching methodologies.  Technology is also an important component of the Stand-alone 
ENL classroom which has computers, i-pads and a Promethean board with computer and computer software programs, such 
as Raz-Kids Internet Library.     French and Spanish books (including dictionaries, content picture dictionaries and ELA, Math 
and Science glossaries) as well as Arabic dictionaries and glossaries (ELA, Math and Science) are housed in the ENL 
classroom.   The ENL teacher shares dictionaries, picture dictionaries and glossaries with classroom teachers for their ELL 
students' use.   ELLs in the early stages of English Language development are not discouraged from using their native 
languages.  As more than 50% of our ELL population speaks a West African language in the home, we have not been able to 
acquire children's reading materials in most of these languages.  The ENL teacher who is proficient in French and has a working 
knowledge of Spanish may use both languages for explanatory and clarification purposes with the French and Spanish 
speakers.  The teacher encourages these students in the initial stages of English language learning to produce written work in 
their native languages in order to ascertain the students' prior educational experience and capabilities.  The teacher then 
translates the words into English and uses the vocabulary derived from the child's own writing as a starting point in her 
instruction, according to the Language Experience Approach methodology.  In addition, the teacher may use words in the 
child's home language (for example, French and Spanish) to assist in vocabulary building on a one-to-one basis in the child's 
writing notebook.  The teacher instructs the French and Spanish speakers on 'cognate recognition' so as to assist them with 
their reading.  
 
All the new students are encouraged to use the computer website 'google translate'' to translate their work from their native 
language into English and vice versa.  In 2017-2018, the Babbel translation App has been added to the program for use on i-
pads.  The ENL teacher instructs the French and Spanish-speakers on 'cognate recognition.'  The Arabic speakers are 
encouraged to use the online Arabic language keyboards  and Arabic-English dictionaries for communicating in writing.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

As a Stand-alone ENL program, we do not have the capability of instructing and assessing students in 10 different languages, 
some of which do not have written orthographies and/or in which the students may not already be literate.  The ENL 
teacher, who is proficient in French and has a working knowledge of Spanish,  uses these languages to explain, instruct and 
assess students who speak these languages throughout the year.  Other multilingual staff members also use the foreign 
languages at their disposal to provide differentiated instruction to our Entering/Emerging/Transitioning so that they may meet 
the curriculum requirements.  As previously mentioned, these students are paired with a student in their class who speaks 
their home language, modeled how to use bilingual dictionaries,  translation websites, Apps. and foreign language keyboards 
(e.g. Arabic).  We provide the students and content area  teachers with Science, Math, Social Studies, and ELA glossaries in 
their home languages (for example, Arabic, French, and Spanish).  
  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?

6a. The ELL population at P.S./I.S. 76 consists of many subgroups, and they all require differentiated instruction. 
  
For the SIFE population in our school, we: 
  
• Provide academic intervention services as an extension of the regular school program for both Integrated and Stand-
alone services. 
• Make an individualized student needs assessment. 
• Differentiate instruction in all areas. 
• Provide grade appropriate instructional support materials. 
• Communicate closely with the parents to monitor their children’s progress. 
  
 
Once SIFE are identified, P.S./I.S. 76 monitors the progress of those students as well as their scores on the NYSESLAT, ELA and 
Math assessments.  Support is provided in all content areas, and instruction is differentiated for varying literacy needs.  On the 
2016 NYSESLAT, the two SIFE progressed to the 'Transitioning' proficiency level which moved them to the status of 
former SIFE.  This academic year 2017-2018 an additional SIFE transferred into P.S./I.S. 76 from another New York City 
school.  Generally, SIFE, like all other Newcomer ELLs, respond well to working in pairs with an English speaking classmate who 
also speaks the same home language or in small groups within the content area classroom. Scaffolding in the form of visual 
representation via computer, Promethean board, concrete hands-on experience of materials (for example, experiments in the 
Science lab); graphic organizers for planning their writing in ELA; viewing videos and primary documents (visuals and graphics) 
in the Social Studies class, etc. 6b. Plan for Newcomers: When a new student is registered in our school, we provide the 
following resources to facilitate the transition: • Buddy system identifying a student who speaks the same home language in 
his/her class who will assist during the day. Finding a student who speaks the same language as the ELL who can help him/her 
in the classroom.• An informal student orientation.• Encourage student to participate in After School activities.• An informal 
assessment is provided to identify possible Academic Intervention programs.• Home school communication is an important 
factor for our newcomers. The newcomers who have been in the US schools for less than three years are provided with a 
variety of strategies and materials that are used to aid their instruction:  scaffolding in the form of picture dictionaries in the 
content areas, dictionaries, posters, photo cards, realia, manipulatives, graphic organizers and the Promethean board with a 
computer that provides access to online curriculum support.  Those students who arrive in 3rd grade or later are required to 
take the ELA test after one year.  In addition to the support received in ENL classes, those students work in small groups with 
their classroom teachers targeting specific areas of need.  They are provided with the support that prepares them to 
participate in NYS assessments (e.g. ELA, Math, Science, Social Studies).  In addition, word to word dictionaries and glossaries 
are in place to support them during the tests as well as translated tests editions in a few languages may be 
available.   Newcomers are not discouraged from using their native languages.  As more than 50% of our ELL population speaks 
a West African language in the home, we have not been able to acquire children’s reading materials in most of these 
languages.  The ENL teacher who is proficient in French and has a working knowledge of Spanish may use both languages for 
clarification purposes with the French and Spanish speakers.  The teacher encourages students in the initial stages of English 
language learning to produce written work in their native languages in order to ascertain the students’ prior educational 
experience and capabilities.  The teacher then translates the sentences into English, and uses the vocabulary derived from the 
child’s own writing as a starting point in her differentiated instruction.  This is in accordance with the Language Experience 
Approach (LEA) methodology.  In addition, the teacher may use words in the child’s home language (for example, French and 
Spanish) to assist in vocabulary building on a one-to-one basis in the child’s notebook.  Classroom teachers who are proficient 
in the student’s Native Language (e.g. French, Spanish) use the language for clarification purposes, and other native language 
speakers who have been in an English speaking system for a longer period can also provide clarification to newcomers. 6c. Plan 
for ELLs receiving services for 4 to 6 years: In 2016-2017, there were 5 students who had been receiving ENL services for 4 - 6 
years. Three of these students were transfers into our school during the year, and 1 was a transfer from the previous school 
year. This year 2017-2018, there are 7 students who have been receiving ENL services for 4-6 years.  Our plan for ELLs receiving 
services for 4 to 6 years is to provide them with the same support structures detailed above in conjunction with a heightened 
focus on reading comprehension strategies.  P.S./I.S. 76's curriculum for instruction is RIGBY's On Our Way to English Program, 
supplemented by the Oxford Picture Dictionary in the Content Areas, Raz-Kids Internet Library, Reading A-Z, Writing A-Z, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

ReadWorks reading and writing program, Khan Academy, and Colorin Colorado.  Some of these Internet Programs, such as 
Reading A-Z, ReadWorks, and Khan Academy provide the same resources in Spanish for the Spanish speaking students.  During 
the previous two years, MIND PLAY Virtual Reading Coach was introduced to enable students to work independently at the 
computer.  However, we have discontinued its use this year for economic reasons. We have found that ELLs who have received 
ENL services for 4 or more years are usually quite competent in their Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills (BICS), and 
seldom need scaffolding in the native language. However,  we do continue to make available to them dictionaries, content 
picture dictionaries and glossaries in the native language (i.e. for French, Spanish and Arabic speakers only). 6d. Plan for Long 
Term ELLs: At the start of the 2017-2018 academic year, there are no Long Term ELLs on our roster.  However, our plan for 
servicing Long Term ELLs is as follows: 
• To monitor their progress in all content areas and differentiate instruction for literacy needs. 
*Re-evaluate our test preparation procedures to better understand which strategies need to be reinforced for these students 
who often seem to get stuck at the 'Expanding' proficiency level for several years. 
• To encourage their participation in all school’s programs which enrich their language and academic skills.• To communicate 
closely with the parents and collaboratively monitor their children’s progress. 6e. Plan for former ELLs: The former ELLs 
continue to receive 90 minutes of Integrated co-teaching from the classroom teacher and ENL teacher.  They have access to 
the same scaffolded and adaptive instructional strategies that the ENL co-teacher uses within the content classroom.  Where 
necessary, former ELLs may require small group modeling and instruction with the other ELLs within this context.  The ENL 
teacher and program remain a resource for former ELLs as long as they require it.    
   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers of ELL-SWDs use a variety of adaptive instructional strategies and grade-level materials to aid in their 
instruction.  They modify the grade curriculum by using scaffolds such as graphics/illustrations, picture dictionaries, photo 
cards, realia, manipulatives, books with text support features and graphic organizers, a Promethean board with computer for 
online access to curriculum support.  They work with the SWDs in Integrated co-teacher (ICT model) where two licensed 
teahers teach the class.  The ICT co-teaches the class at a slower pace, providing step-by-step instruction, chunking and 
explaining paragraphs of text, and then working with the smaller more homogenous group according to 
their readiness ability.  Those SWDs requiring SETTs are serviced in small group settings where some strategies used are visual 
cues, modeling, chunking and explaining the text one paragraphs at a time, and providing 1-on-1 instruction.  All of these 
teaching strategies provide access to academic content and accelerate English language development. 
 
Working in tandem with the ENL teacher, the various service providers coordinate the student's schedule with one other so 
that all the mandates are implemented.  Our ENL program currently has 1 former and 4 current ELLs with disabilities.  Two of 
them are in a 12:1:1 self-contained class; two work with an Integrated Co-teacher (ICT), while 1 works with the SETTs teacher 
in a pull-out setting.  All of the service providers provide the SWDs with a certain amount of small group instruction within a 
classroom context. 
 
If an IEP mandates bilingual instruction, the SBST team finds an appropriate placement for the child, usually at P.S. 165 (234 
West 109 Street).  If it is not possible to find a proper placement for the student or the parent chooses to keep the child  in this 
school, the student automatically receives ENL services.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
As mentioned in the above paragraph, the ENL teacher and other service providers (ICT, SETTs) coordinate the SWDs' 
instruction together.   During the regular school day, students are assigned to small groups to work with the different service 
providers who address the academic skills and goals specified on their IEPs.  They are also taught the general curriculum skills 
required for their grade level.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Targeted interventions programs for all the different ELL subgroups are the Balanced Literacy Extended Day Program; the 
Saturday Literacy Institute and Academic Enrichment Programs in ELA and Math; Library Power; and RAZ-KIDS Internet 
Library.  All intervention services are offered in English since our school has no TBE or DL programs.  
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

P.S./I.S. 76 uses Common Core aligned curricula recommended by the Department of Education for both ELA and 
Math.  Grades K-5 uses ReadyGEN for ELA while Grades 6-8 uses Common Core CODE X.  For Math, Grades K-2 uses GO MATH! 
while Grades 6-8 uses  CONNECTED MATH CMP3.  These core curricula are supplemented by various computer software 
programs for both ELA and Math, such ReadWorks, Khan Academy, Kids A-Z, Virtual Nerd, IXL, etc.)  This year, the ENL program 
has access to the Learning A-Z Programs (Reading A-Z, Writing A-Z).   All ELL subgroups have access to these materials, but the 
Newcomer ELLs, and SIFE are targeted the most because of the interactive nature of these programs, as well as the visuals and 
graphic organizers which  help to clarify new material for them.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

In the past 19 years, we have never had a bilingual program at P.S. 76. 
   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs at P.S./I.S. 76 have equal access to all school programs and supplemental services offered in our building. They are 
available to all parents and students in the school – guidance counselor, family worker, parent coordinator, occupational 
therapist, speech and language therapist, social worker, and psychologist.  Students take part in the community building 
activities.   ELLs participate in the after school program that offers homework help, computer literacy, and test prep.  During 
this time, ELA teachers and Special Education teachers work closely with the ELL students providing differentiated instruction 
to meet their required needs. Our current After School Title III Program uses the various levels of Read, Think, Write 
(Continental Press), and other reading materials more aligned with the Common Core State Standards. 
   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
ELLs as well as all other students in the lower grades use Pearson's ReadyGEN for English Language Arts and HMH Go Math! for 
Math.  The upper grades use Scholastic Code X for English Language Arts and Connected Math Program 3 (CMP3) for 
Math.  Other instructional materials that the English Language Learners use are RIGBY's On Our Way to English Program, 
Attanasio & Associates Language Proficiency Intervention Kits which use science as a vehicle to increase language proficiency 
in grades K-8, Benchmark Educational Company's English Explorers series of science readers for the upper grades (including 
DVDs and CD-Roms).  Both programs are aligned with the ELA Standards, ENL standards and the National Science 
Standards.  This is supplemented by the The Oxford Picture Dictionary in the content areas with workbooks (grades 3-8).  In 
addition, Learning A-Z Programs (Reading A-Z, Writing A-Z, RAZ-KIDS Internet Library) are either directly by the students or as 
teacher resources. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

French and Spanish books, picture dictionaries, books-on-tape, glossaries, as well as Arabic-English  dictionaries are a part of 
the ENL classroom Library, and are easily accessible to our newly incoming ELLs who speak these languages.  Some classrooms 
have also been provided with Spanish and French books (including dictionaries), as well as Arabic dictionaries.  In addition, we 
make use of online translation websites, such as Google Translate and Arabic Keyboard. 
 
The district has several other languages represented, such as: Arabic, Wolof, Bambara, Mandingo, French, Dioula, Garifuna, 
and Fulani.  Historically,  P.S./I.S.76 has been able to provide only the new Spanish students with the option of having the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

 

content area tests in their native language for reference.  Spanish Math textbooks and workbooks often are provided to ELLs in 
the upper grades, whenever they are available.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The required services support, and resources correspond to ELL’s ages and grade levels because all ELLs are in the grades 
commensurate with their age.  ELLs receive the same services and resources as their English-speaking peers.  They are taught 
the same curriculum as their English- speaking peers.  And, if they have I.E.P.'s, the service providers are required to follow the 
mandates of the I.E.P with regard to appropriate services recommended. 
    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Not Applicable.   Although we do share a building with a Special Needs School, and some of their students are part of our 
Inclusion Program, none of their students are ELLs or part of our ENL program.  Each school has its own budget, although both 
schools share common areas such as the lunchroom, auditorium, bathrooms, etc.  The students interact with one another in 
the common spaces, and in the Inclusion classrooms.  However, as previously mentioned, the ENL teacher services only ELLs in 
P.S. 76.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Our ELL population is quite small, and as such, we conduct orientations with the parents as they enroll their children and after 
the child is identified as an eligible candidate for ENL instructional services.  We do not, however, conduct an orientation 
session to assist the newly enrolled students prior to the first day of school. Parents meet with the School Secretary, Parent 
Coordinator, Assistant Principals, Principal (the latter three, all licensed teachers themselves), and School Counselor to discuss 
the student's enrollment, necessary supporting documentation, and to conduct the parent oral interview.  Once the school 
year begins, the ENL teacher conducts oral interviews with the new students to determine if they need to be administered the 
NYSITELL.  
 
Throughout the year, ELL parents and students are invited to attend and participate in Meet-the-Teacher night, Parent-
Teacher Conferences, 1-on-1 meetings with the ENL teacher, monthly classroom visits in the Middle School, as well as ENL-
related parent workshops [See 'Parental Involvement' section]   I. Over the phone translation is available, if necessary, and 
multilingual members of the school community (such as, paraprofessionals, Harlem Children's Zone staff, etc,) also provide 
support.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Students in the 8th   grade are offered foreign language electives, such as Latin, French, Spanish, German, Chinese and 
American Sign Language.  
    
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Professional development is provided by school staff, community learning support personnel, and other organizations, and is 
considered a key component of the P.S./I.S. 76 community.  Workshops attended and turnkeyed by the ENL teacher and other 
members of staff (e.g. the technology teacher) have included:  Stages of Second Language Development; Scaffolding in the ENL 
Classroom; Teaching Reading and Writing to English Language Learners; Making Content Comprehensible; Interactive Websites 
for Learning English and Content in Grades K-4; How the NYSESLAT Can Drive Instruction and Differentiated 
Instruction Overview.  
 
This is in addition to the ongoing Literacy and Mathematics workshops provided by C.I.T.E.to teachers in order to address the 
needs of all students, including ELLs and struggling students.  Grade level collaborative groups meet weekly to plan lessons, 
discuss ideas, share professional resources and review books used in the classroom.  All members of staff, including teachers, 
assistant principals, guidance counselors, special education teachers, psychologist, school secretaries and the parent 
coordinator attend professional development sessions. The ENL teacher attends professional development workshops 
organized by the Division of English Language Learners and Student Support (DELLs) as well as the Compliance Performance 
Specialists' ELL Instructional Coaches.  The ENL teacher together with other content teachers (e.g. Math coach) 
attend/participate in online webinars which they turnkey to the rest of the staff.   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
As noted above, P.S./I.S. 76 provides professional development to all teachers and administrators that specifically addresses 
the needs of English Language Learners.  A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional development hours 
for all teachers newly prescribed by CR Part 154.2 is dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for 
co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English Language Learners (ELLs).  The classroom 
teachers receive strategies and support with instruction and materials for the ELLs.  The attendance is always taken, and 
records are kept in the ENL classroom files.  Workshops attended by the ENL teacher and other members of staff (e.g. 
technology teacher) and turnkeyed to the rest of the staff have included:  Danielson's Framework as it relates to ELLs (Getting 
to Know Your Student; Facilitating Development Through ENL Instruction (BICS and CALP); How We Can Best Support 
Children's Second Language Acquisition; Literacy Strategy:  Sentence Starters and Frames for Language Development; Stages of 
Second Language Acquisition; Scaffolding in the ENL Classroom; Teaching Reading and Writing to English Language Learners; 
Making Input/Content Comprehensible; Interactive Websites for Learning English and Content in Grades K-4; How the 
NYSESLAT Drives Instruction; and Overview of Differentiated Instruction. 
 
In 2017-2018, the ENL teacher will attend five Professional Learning Opportunities offered by the Manhattan FSC throughout 
the year. The sessions will meet on 9/19/17, 10/18/17, 11/28/17, 1/25/18, and 3/9/18.  She will also participate in a workshop 
dedicated to the NYSESLAT as well as a webinar on the topic of ELLs and Vocabulary Development.  The Content Areas to be 
covered are English Language Arts, Assessment, Writing, Pedagogy, Policy Implementation, ENL, and Literacy.  
 
Some of the topics to be turnkeyed by the ENL teacher this year are:  Setting Clear Purposes for ELLs; Asking the Right 
Questions; Supports During Explicit Instruction for Diverse Learners; How to Engage and Support K-6 English Language Learners 
in Math; and ENL Strategies.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Parent involvement in our school, including parents of ELLs, is a key component of our every year planning.  
As previously noted, ELL parents are invited to attend and participated in Meet-the-Teacher Night, Parent-Teacher 
Conferences, 1-on-1 meetings with the ENL teacher, monthly classroom visits in the Middle School, ENL-related parent 
workshops, and an automated calling system put in place by the Parent Coordinator. 
 
The ENL teacher explains to parents the goals of the program, the proficiency level of their child, how their child is progressing 
(academically and behaviorally), the assessments they will be taking, such as the ELA, Science and Social Studies state tests, 
and the NYSESLAT.  They are apprised of testing exemptions for ELLs, accommodation for ELLs and promotional policy for ELLs 
in these meetings or by mail. 
 
The ENL teacher keeps sign-in sheets for meetings (Group Orientations and individual 1-on-1) with parents.  The ENL teacher 
communicates with parents, in person, by letter and by phone.  If a parent cannot come to the school to meet with the ENL 
teacher, the ENL teacher reaches out by phone, either directly or through the Parent Coordinator.  She keeps a 'Phone Call' 
Record sheet for these parents.  
  
  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Additionally, P.S./I.S. 76 provides materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their 
academic achievement, for example, Family Literacy Workshops, The Grow Report Workshops, Parents Rights Workshops. The 
school also provides Parent Involvement Workshops (e.g. Nutrition, Science, Health, Technology, Music, Art, Physical 
Education and Dance (Zumba), Arts & Crafts and Behavior modification).   There is always a translator available to ease 
communication whenever it is deemed necessary.  These workshops are scheduled and coordinated by the Parent Coordinator 
and the SAPIS worker.  The Parents-Teachers Association participates in activities such as Bake Sales, Pee Wee dance, etc. in 
order to raise funds for school trips, excursions, and the Eighth grade out of state trip and moving up dance.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Charles Deberry, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

A review of several ATS Reports (e.g. RLER, RLAT, RHLA, RPOB) will provide us with information about the 
languages spoken in the homes by all of our families. We retrieve most of our data about language preferences of 
the parent community for both written and oral communication from the Home Language Inventory Surveys 
(HLIS). In addition, the ENL teacher, Parent Coordinator, and several other staff members will assess the language 
needs of parents through phone and in person contact.           

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74 

 

Language  

Written Preferred  

Percent Written  

Oral Preferred  

Percent Oral  

Data from the RCPL Report 
reveal that 82.08 percent of 
parents (i.e. 394 in total) 
choose English  

as their preferred language 
for both oral and written 
communication. Spanish 
speakers almost always 
choose Spanish for both 
writing and speaking. Our 
ELL parents from the West 
African countries such as 
Senegal, Mali, Ivory Coast, 
and Guinea almost 
exclusively opt for English in 
both written and oral 
communications. This can 
be explained by the fact 
that they are aware that the 
use of their home languages 
(Fulani, Mandinka, Wolof, 
Malinke, Bambara) is 
currently not an option with 
the New York City 
Education Department of 
Education. Arabic- speaking 
parents from Yemen tend 
to choose Arabic for their 
written and oral 
communication. A few 
parents overlook the 
question, and do not 
choose a preferred 
language for 
communication.

1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be 

distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.

How do you plan to translate? 

Families  

Include procedures to ensure timely 
provision of translated documents 

to parents.  

Documents prepared and translated by 
the Department of Education 
pertaining to the English Language 
Program (for example, Notification 
Letters, Placement Letters, City-wide 
Parent conferences, etc.). School-wide 
notices such as parent-teacher 
conferences and parent workshops 
tend to be translated into Spanish. We 
have found that most of our speakers 
of low incidence languages (for 
example, Ibo, Fulani, Malinke) have 
received literacy in one of the high 
incidence languages such as English, 
French) only. All correspondence is 
disseminated in a timely manner.

2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as 

parent-teacher  
conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.

The Parent-Teacher Orientations and 
conferences will occur on September 
20, 2018 and November 27, 2018, 
March 26, 2019, and May 16, 2019. 
In addition, the ENL teacher 
schedules on-going Orientation 
meetings with parents within 5 to 10 
days of their child's enrollment in 
P.S./I.S. 76. During the course of the 
year the ENL teacher will also meet 
with the parent of each English 
Language Learner (ELL), according to 
the new Part 54 mandate. In 
addition, the middle school teachers 
have scheduled monthly grade 

Meeting take place once each month 
during the school year. 

In cases, where the parent does not 
bring along an English-speaking 
interpreter, the school will use 
contracted vendors of interpretation 
services. We will inform all school 
teaching staff of translation and 
interpretation resources available, 
including the language line and how to 
access it. Bilingual staff will be used 
only when necessary.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

Have parents who speak the same home language communicate the emergency message to them. Otherwise, have 
translators contact families.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Professional Development workshops presented by ENL teacher/coordinator. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Our school will fulfill parental notification requirements for translation and interpretation services through the use of 
the Interpretation Unit of the Department of Education, staff members and parents in our community. The ENL 
teacher will work with the Parent Coordinator to coordinate translation and interpretation needs. We will continue to 
use the available interpretation services at our disposal (see above).  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Our school will gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services through translated parent 
surveys culled from the Translation and Interpretation Unit's Intranet page. In the event that there is no written form 
in the required language, we may conduct an oral interview using another parent as interpreter or the Language Line. 
In addition, the Parent Coordinator schedules parent workshops, and parent meetings together with the ENL teacher 
who meets with parents during the year.
