Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7 

 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 Alejandrina Benitez de Gautier is a learning community where adults and children learn alongside one another. All of 
our constituents are held to high standards, expectations and accountability. The best that each of our community 
members have to offer is sought after, cultivated, shared and celebrated. 

 

Our school's mission is to cultivate academic excellence through a partnership with students, teachers, families and 
community. We are committed to empowering learners. Every student will be inspired to achieve, challenged to 
learn, grow and meet their maximum academic potential.  

 

We strive to ensure that every child becomes truly literate through a curriculum rich in literature, science, 
mathematics, social studies, technology, the arts and social and emotional development.  

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

PS/IS 377 is a pre-K through 5th grade school located in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn New York. Our diverse 
student population encompasses 85% Hispanic, 11.5% Black, 2% White and 1% Asian. Students with special needs 
comprise 23% and ELLs account for 19% of our student population. Student attendance is 91% and teacher 
attendance is 93%. 

Students learn through real world experiences outside the school, which include field trips utilizing New York City as a 
learning laboratory. Some of the places our students have visited include the Museum of Natural History, the Hall of 
Science, the 911 Museum, the River Walk the Ridgewood Reservoir. The City Parks Foundation Community Gardens.  

To ensure a well-rounded education, our school offers two community based organizations: Sports and Art in Schools 
Foundation(SASF) and Coalition of Hispanic Families (Arts and Literacy) after school enrichment programs for students 
in grades K through 5th. The programs offer flag football, volleyball, basketball, soccer, lacrosse, dance, Yoga, drama, 
technology, art therapy, and homework help. We have partnered with Fyre Zone to provide after school dance and 
vocal music for students in grades K through 5th.  

 

Our youngest students in Pre-K through 2nd grade participate in the Cook Shop program which educates students to 
the benefits of healthy nutritional habits and gives them the opportunity to prepare simple recipes with fruits and 
vegetables. Our 3rd and 4th graders continue to participate in the MY Plate program which teaches about the food 
groups through performing arts. We have also established a wellness council which educates and enlightens students 
about the importance of making healthy food and beverage choices. 

 

We are a NY Sun Works Greenhouse Project school. Our students in grades Pre- Kindergarten through 5th grade 
engage in learning about life cycles through growing plants from seeds in hydroponic growing systems. This school

approach which involves practice with representation and calculation strategies that derive from the algebraic 
operations practices in the Next Generation Standards. This will promote students sharing their thinking about 
specific problem types, allow students to make connections and develop deep conceptual understanding with a focus 
on deliberate questioning, visualization, and representation of math concepts that derive from the algebraic 
operations practices in the Next Generation Standards.  

  

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our special education students and English language learners continue to need additional assistance in ELA and Math. 
We will continue to provide after school support (pending funding), at risk Special Education Teacher Support Services 
(SETSS) and at risk English as a New Language (ENL) support to the students that will benefit the most from these 
interventions.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The area of the Framework for Great Schools that we continue to make progress in is the area of trust. We will 
continue to have teachers support their colleagues by opening their classrooms for visitations designed to support 
improving teacher practice.  

 

We must continue to focus on Rigorous Instruction, Collaborative Teachers and Supportive Environment for the 2018-
2019 school year. Our focus will remain improving the quality of classroom instruction and designing coherent 
instruction.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans  

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, 
and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious 
intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support) 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice 
Tenet 3 Statement of Practice 
Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan. 
3.2 

The school leader ensures and supports the quality implementation of a systematic plan of 
rigorous and coherent curricula appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning 
Standards (CCLS) that is monitored and adapted to meet the needs of students. 
Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction 
(DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and 
address student achievement needs. 
The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner 
within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the 
arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities. 
Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative 
assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

After reflecting on the the previous year's (School Comprehensive Education Plan (SCEP) goals and our Superintendent's 
feedback after visiting our school we have identified and will prioritize and address the following needs in the goal and 
action plans for this Framework element. 

 

3.3- Although we are using CCLS aligned curriculum which includes Go Math, Ready Gen, School- Wide Writing, Amplify 
Science, and Passport to Social Studies, we have discovered that in order to provide our students with appropriately 
rigorous instruction, our teachers must continue to plan scaffolds and multiple entry points to address the needs of all 
learners across grades. We will continue to utilize Think through Math (pending funding), the computer adapted math 
program to support student learning in mathematics. We are also able to provide our students with Math Stories which 
is a component of Navigator math which provides students with the opportunity to share their thinking with their peers 
about the process that they employed to solve word problems presented to them orally.

In order to assess and gather student data to inform instruction, we will utilize the i-Ready assessment program in both 
ELA and math and the Writing Pathways (2014)continuum for writing.  

 

3.5- The focus will continue to build upon the professional learning cycle which addressed Component 3D: Using 
Assessment in instruction in order to ensure cohesive school wide assessment practices such as: ongoing checks for 
understanding throughout instruction, formative assessments and end of unit tasks. The assessment cycle will include 
an assessment calendar which identifies all the summative and formative assessments, analysis of assessment results to 
inform instruction and revising lesson and unit plans as needed. We will also focus on providing high quality student 
feedback that is reflective of the characteristics of the growth mindset; a topic that we plan to embrace this school year.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, teachers across grades Kindergarten- Grade 5 will work in teacher teams to revise lessons to include 
scaffolds, ELL supports and extensions to improve rigorous math instruction for all learners as measured by a 25% 
increase between the student performance on the baseline and the endline of the I-Ready Diagnostic Assessments.

student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, SIFE, 
STH). 

Analyze 2017-18 summative Assessment results and September 
2018 beginning of year assessment results. This will include looking 
at students' scale scores and identifying level ones at both the 
lowest and highest of the range. An AIS plan will be developed to 
support level ones that can be moved to level 2.  

 

Using data results (2017-18) summative Assessments and 
September 2018 ( beginning of year assessments) teachers will 
identify trends and individual student needs. Teachers will use the 
findings to group students for instruction utilizing the Go Math 
research based CCLS aligned programs. Teachers will draft necessary 
scaffolds, extensions, supports, assessments and ongoing daily 
checks for understanding to support students’ progress towards unit 
objectives. The I-Ready computer program will be used to assist with 
differentiating instruction based on student needs. Math stories will 
also be added to the math instructional to provide students with 
access to rigorous problem types.

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Reflecting on the needs of our school, we have identified communicating high expectations to families as a continued 
area of focus for the 2017-2018 school year. In order to strengthen parent involvement within our school, students and 
families need to feel a greater connection to our school and embrace the high expectations of the school community. 
Clear expectations will be communicated to families and students through a parent and student handbook. This will be 
monitored through quarterly parent and student surveys.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.

February, and May) by the Parent involvement team to measure 
parent satisfaction of the instructional program, teaching and 
administrative staff and parent-school communication.  

The Parent involvement team will support parent-school 
communication with the use of the Instagram and the PS/IS 377 
school app, School Messenger phone system, and our school 
website. In an effort to increase parent engagement in their 
children's educational lives, the school will host a series of cyber 
safety workshops using the Common Sense curriculum. We will also 
plan a variety of events for parents to participate in with their 
children (Literacy and Math Nights, Family Day, Multicultural Day, 
etc.).

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS/IS 377, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

 

PS/IS 377 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology;

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated

The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;

The Title III funds will be used to implement an after school program for English Language 
Learners Language Development.  ELA and Math strategies will be used to help students 
achieve higher scores on the NYSESLAT, and city and state assessments (ELA & Math). 
The afterschool program will service approximately 10 students with one certified ENL teacher 
along with one content area teacher. The instructional program will service ELLs in grades 3-5. 
The program will take place from October 17- May 9. It will meet for 50 sessions, 2 days a week 
(Wednesdays & Thursdays) from 2:30-4:30.  
Our Certified ENL teacher (Ms. S. Shirley) and our common branch teacher (Mrs. Pagan) will 
provide supplemental instruction in alignment with the NYC and NYS content and performance 
standards; instruction will focus on intensified second language development. The two hour 
instructional block will be divided into two 60 minute periods. The instructional block will be 
divided with ELA and Math instruction. The ENL teacher will provide instructional services to 
half the class for 60 minutes, while the common branch teacher provides direct ELA/Math 
instruction to the other half of the class. In this way each class will be receiving instruction from 
a qualified provider and it will be in alignment with the NYC and NYS content and performance 
standards. It would also be meeting the requirements and language needs of our ELLs.  Our 
afterschool program will align instruction to improve literacy skills in ENL/ELA to help students 
achieve the benchmarks as set forth on the NYSESLAT and the NYS ELA. The focus will be in 
Reading comprehension, Math and a specific target on Writing. The students are mixed levels of 
Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, and Expanding. The Entering and Emerging students will 
have support of the native language, Spanish and Haitian creole, with an emphasis of language 
acquisition. The language of instruction for the Transitioning and Expanding students will be in 
English. Our students were identified by the NYSITELL, NYSESLAT and New York State 
exams (ELA & Math).The first hour of the program will focus on ELA and Math, and the second 
half of the program will target specific strategies for ENL and NYSESLAT preparation (with an 
emphasis on writing).  The students will be provided with a pre-test, mid-year assessment and a 
post-test that will help us monitor progress throughout the program.    
 The materials we will use include:  Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT, Test Ready in ELA and 
Math, Common Core Clinics, i-Ready,  New York Content Reading, Longman Photo Dictionary, 
and Language Power Building Language Proficiency for ELLs. General instructional supplies 
such as chart paper, markers, pencils, pens, highlighters, construction paper, post-it, portfolio 
folders, teacher binders, composition books and any other materials necessary will be purchased 
by the school to support the After school program. The total cost will be $2,230.16. 
 
The activities below are divided into the total amount of sessions that they will be teaching.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our school currently uses TCRWP running records and teacher-created assessments. They allow us to monitor our students 
learning and provide feedback that can be used by our teachers to help improve student learning. The formative assessments 
helps students identify their strengths and weaknesses. It also helps our teachers identify where our ELLs are struggling and 
immediately address the problem. The running records results allows us to evaluate and determine where our ells stand 
compared to our No –ELL population. All the gathered information is used to group students and to differentiate instruction 
based on their individual needs.

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The structures that support our formative assessments include: 
Goal setting:   clear expectations are created between the students and teacher. We use student work and classroom tests to 
show what is expected and help our students where they are and where they need to be. 
Observations:  observations assist the teachers in gathering evidence of the students learning and it can be used in the 
instructional planning. 
Questioning strategies: Asking questions allows the opportunity for deeper thinking and provides the teachers with insight on 
the student level of understanding. 
Self/Peer assessment: allows students to create a learning community within the classroom. The students can use each other 
as a resource for understanding. 
 This assist us with targeting students for more rigorous enrichment activities such as the title III afterschool program. We also 
use it to identify the students that are approaching grade level standards in ELA and Mathematics. We target these students 
and encourage them to attend the after school academy.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The summative assessments being used are: 
State Assessments 
ELL Periodic Assessments 
Benchmarks or Interim Assessments 
End of unit tests  
We use these as a gauge to compare student learning to content standards. The summative assessments help to evaluate the 
effectiveness of our program. It allows us to see how we can improve on our school goals 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once all summative data has been gathered appropriate instructional interventions and progress is monitored regularly. 
Students receive ELA/ENL instruction and targeted intervention. The instruction and intervention is provided by the licensed 
ENL teacher and the classroom teacher. Consistent collaboration occurs with the ENL and classroom teacher, the two monitor 
and determine the process for monitoring the students’ progress.  It includes the type of assessment and the method of data 
collection. 
 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
At the start of the school year, we review our TC running records and the beginning of the year math assessments from GO 
Math.  
Screening is administered to all students for the purpose of establishing a baseline of performance and identifying students 
who are not making academic progress. Students demonstrating patterns of concern are identified and are provided with 
increasingly intensive interventions based on the content with which they struggle. English Language Learners who score 
below specific levels of performance, our school will determine the Tier group and additional support services to provide the 
student. Progress monitoring provides the opportunity, through on-going checks, to track the progress of students identified 
as needing intervention toward meeting learning standards. Data collected as part of progress monitoring are used to make 
informed decisions about changes to intervention.  
Parent notification is provided in writing when a student requires instruction and intervention beyond what is provided in the 
Tier 1 setting. Parents must be notified regarding:  
     * Rationale for moving the student into a higher, more intensive tier  
     * The amount and nature of student performance data collected  
     * Interventions provided  

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           55 

 

 

     * Strategies to be utilized in increasing the student’s rate of learning  
     * Parents’ right to request an evaluation for special education services  
Staff members are qualified in both the knowledge and skills necessary to implement all components of RTI with fidelity.   
ELL students who are below grade level (at risk) are serviced by their classroom teacher with Core Instruction and they are also 
serviced in small groups.  We track their progress through informative classroom observations, and by using Periodic 
Assessments and the TC running record as a mid-line and end-line. The data results are compared and an analysis is 
conducted. Based on the results, we determine if the Pupil Personnel Team should study a particular case.  If a teacher feels 
that a student needs Tier 3 intervention, the teacher must demonstrate that the appropriate plan for small group instruction 
was in place and properly conducted.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
 Our school looks at the data to determine students progress over the past two years were able determine who is advancing 
from one level to the next, we also identify students that are approaching grade level standards in ELA and Mathematics. The 
data allows us to target students for more rigorous enrichment activitied such as Title III afterschool. The data outcomes for 
the NYSESLAT and state exams  suggest that our students are making a slow but steady progress in moving from one level to 
another. Our ELLs in the Transitional Bilingual Special Education Program take tests in English and in Spanish, however the 
students perform slightly better in their native language. The school leadership and the teachers use the assessments as a 
baseline for student performance. We also examine if progress was made between each benchmark period. The teachers 
analyze the results to determine which areas of the test the students show strengths and weaknesses and then use the results 
to inform their instruction.  We have learned that our students still need assistance with listening, speaking, reading and 
writing for literary responses and critical analysis and evaluation.    
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Our English Language Learners are serviced by both the ENL teachers through push-in or pull-out services. The students are 
grouped for ENL services to support their language development in the four strands of reading, writing, listening, and speaking. 
In the classroom the students are grouped to ensure that their linguistic needs are being met through the use of turn and talks 
and cooperative learning. In examining a student's needs, a collaborative team approach is used. The ENL teachers and 
classroom teachers communicate on an ongoing basis about the data collected and they collaborate to ensure that the 
language goals of the students are being met.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

        At our school we are currently using a push-in and pull-out model. Our two licensed ENL teachers Ms. S. Shirley 
Ms. C. Shirley meet with the students at the Beginner/ Entering level for 360 minutes, Low Intermediate/Emerging 
360 minutes, Intermediate/ Transitioning180 minutes, Advanced/ Expanding 180 minutes, and 
Proficient/Commanding 90minutes. Whether following the push-in or pull-out model, students are grouped based on 
their English proficiencies.  In the Push-in model the ENL teachers work with the students to provide language 
acquisition and vocabulary support. They work in collaboration with the classroom teacher. In the Pull-out model: 
ELLs who spend the majority of their day in all-English content instruction are brought together from various classes 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           56 

 

 

for English-acquisition-focused instruction. The ENL teachers plan carefully with general education teachers to ensure 
curricular alignment and continuity of instruction.    
  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

        Our school currently has one TBE class (SWD's) in grades 6  th  -8  th   . In the TBE class the students transfer their 
home language skills to English by spending instructional time primarily in the home language before steadily 
transitioning to English. At the beginning/entering level, TBE students receive 75% of instruction in their home 
language and 25% in English. As the student’s English proficiency increases, more of their instructional day is spent 
learning in English.    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

              N/A    

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2

ENL is delivered to ELL students through teacher modeling and various activities designed to increase competencies. In student 
practice the teacher guides the students through a lesson and allows for feedback and student application. Teachers also 
implement the workshop model for ENL instruction. (shared reading, guided reading, read alouds. etc). The instructional 
minutes are delivered based on the CR-Part 154 mandates: (see above)  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   In our school science and social studies are taught in line with the NYC scope and sequence. In grades K-5 we use Ready Gen 
for ELA and GoMath for math instruction. Students  in grades 6-8 receive instruction through Code-X for ELA and CMP 3 for 
math. 
        Content-area instruction in the native language and English is designed to teach subject matter to ELLs; and a Native 
Language Arts (NLA) component designed to develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in the students’ home 
language.  
        Our TBE classes use native language instruction for ELA and Math, and use English instruction in Social Studies and 
Science. Technology is integrated throughout all curriculum areas, especially programs designed to meet the needs of the 
second language learner. The ENL Push-in and Pull-out program services ELLs in grades K-8 and as a way to support our ELLS in 
the classroom, the ENL teachers work closely with classroom teachers to follow themes and lessons being taught. Students are 
exposed to authentic grade level texts, and materials as well as the explicit teaching and reading and writing strategies that 
will aid them in meeting state and local assessments.  Our goal is to provide all ELLs with a high quality education and language 
rich instruction that will allow our students to meet the content and performance standards while acquiring English 
proficiency. In an effort to increase the teaching quality of reading and writing we have included in our instructional plan:  
      * ENL programs that reflect visuals, appropriate teaching charts with graphic organizers 
      * Scaffolding instruction for all learners 
      * Differentiated instruction during reading and writing 
      * Additional/supplemental academic intervention for ELL learners in AIS using Common Core Clinics 
        The Common Core learning standards combined with the New York State ENL standards play a significant role in the 
implementation of then ENL curriculum. Both standards are used in conjunction to assure that our ELL students are receiving

high quality instruction in both English and the content areas. Our ENL teachers provide instruction in English utilizing ENL 
strategies and methodologies. In collaboration with the classroom teachers, ENL teachers reinforce content instruction and 
use content materials. We currently use Language Power,  it’s a series of texts  on various language levels . It engages the 
students in language -rich, content-rich and engaging lessons that gives the students an opportunity enjoy a variety of texts 
and the opportunities to engage with their peers and teachers.    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

    We use the Core Assessment Battery which provides multiple data points to establish diagnostic profiles for each student 
that is then used to establish starting points and pathways for individualized instruction. Our ELLs are also appropriately 
evaluated during the initial identification process with the Spanish LAB, as well as teacher generated assessments in the TBE 
classes. Instruction for ELLs is differentiated by the classroom and ENL teacher, with the use of multilingual books, classroom 
libraries as well as glossaries/dictionaries.  Our instructions are Data Driven, with the results from the NYSESLAT, periodic and 
Interim assessments.    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

All students are provided with differentiated instruction to meet and exceed city and state learning and performance 
standards: 
      a. Students who come from another country with little or no formal education will be identified         through the HLIS 
and Parent/Child Interview. Once identified as a SIFE student, the child will be appropriately placed. Students will be provided 
with AIS and participate in our Afters chool program. 
      b. ELLs in school for less than three years will be tested annually to determine English Language acquisition and level. 
Students will receive the appropriate ENL instruction following the levels of English according to the NYSESLAT and LAB, which 
will include , reading, writing, speaking , and listening. In addition these students will be mandated to attend all 
additional instructional activities provided:ie, after school program. 
      c. ELLs who have completed 4-6 six years will receive mandated services for ELLs, but will also receive AIS service and 
participate in all programs available to monolingual students. The instructional program focuses on reading, writing, 
and listening. The ESL teacher and classroom teacher collaborate on best practices and share ideas that will keep the students 
on track and is aligned to the curriculum. Ongoing assessments will be provided in order to track their literacy skills. 
      d. Long term ELLs that are not given an extension of services from the state will be provided with intensive test practice 
classes. They will participate in after school, small group instruction, and individualized instruction. Support services are 
provided by the ENL teachers , AIS providers and classroom teacher. The ENL instruction for each child is dependent on their 
English level on the NYSESLAT. 
     e. Former ELL students are invited to attend the Title III after school program. They are also afforded all test 
accommodations that apply to current ENL students. For at least two years following the school year in which a student is 
exited from Ell status, former ELLs receive at least one half of one unit of English as a new language (90 minutes per week) and 
are eligible for certain specified testing accommodations. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
          Our Teachers of ELL SWDs use various strategies and techniques to ensure that their students are provided with the 
same academic content as the general Ed populatoon.  Our SWDs are instructed through the use of graphic organizers, visuals, 
sentence starters , and the use of the smartboard. ELLs identified as SWDs are programmed according to their individualized 
Educational Plan (IEP), provided with all mandated support services in addition to ENL. They are given the opportunity to

participate in all afterschool activities when available. Teachers and staff follow the IEP for each child. The instruction is data 
driven, according to their English level on the NYSESLAT, NYSITELL  and all other standardized tests.          
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
 Our instructional staff work in collaboration to support our ELL SWDs in meeting their IEP goals and attaining English language 
proficiency. ENL services are provided based on the students linguistic needs. ELL SWDs are grouped and serviced  regularly 
with other ELLs (non SWDs) based upon their instructional needs.  When applicable our ELL SWD students are afforded the 
opportunity to mainstream into general education or ICT settings in specific subject areas of strength.                   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
       We currently have identified ELL students who will receive intervention through after school program opportunities and 
during extended day.  ELL students will use the Common Core Clinics ELA and Math, Test Ready ELA and Math,  and Great 
Leaps (if applicable) during specific blocks of the day.       
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

   We are currently utilizing The Greenhouse Science classroom, it is dedicated to improving K-8th grade environmental science 
education. Most classes visit the green house 2x's per week. Our greenhouse classroom lab offers students the opportunity to 
grow food, while learning hands on about nutrition, water resource management, efficient land use, climate change, 
biodiversity, conservation, contamination, pollution, waste management, and sustainable development. To facilitate this 
hands on learning environment the green house lab can include hydroponic growing systems, a weather station, integrated 
pest management and a vermi-composting station. The LAB operates as an integrated part of the school's curricula and 
prepares our students to exceed NYC's science standards. In addition to enhancing a school's science curriculum, the 
greenhouse lab greatly enriches arts and social studies by connecting nature to culture. Students learn the relationship 
between humans and the environment and gain a greater appreciation of sustainable development and its direct relationship 
to cultural diversity.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

At this time we have chosen to continue with our current programs which are aligned to the CCLS.    
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 
All our ELL students across all subgroups participate in all school programs. ELLs in the testing grades who fell below grade 
level in ELA and Math are given priority to attend our supplemental programs.  After School academic reading 
intervention  services for  grades 1-5, Title 1 Priority Focus after school program for grades 3-6, AIS/Test prep academy for 
grades 3-8, and Title III after school for grades 2-5. These ELLS will be targeted through small group instruction, differentiated 
instruction in both math and ELA.

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Our ELLs are provided with dictionaries, glossaries  bilingual texts in math. We try to pair our ELLs with a buddy or we use 
paraprofessionals and parent volunteers to assist within the classroom. 
Our TBE class receives 60% of instruction in the student's native language (Spanish), Multiple assessments , both formal and 
informal will be conducted throughout the year. As the students develop fluency in English, the instructional time will 
continually increase as outlined by the CR-Part 154 guidelines.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All activities such as SETTS, Speech, and AIS are age and grade appropriate, the curriculum is grade specific and is supported

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Dominic Zagami, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Our written translations assessments needs were found by a careful review of the Student blue emergency cards, 
home language surveys, UPPG screen, as well as information gathered during registration. During parent meetings 
and orientations we will continue to provide information through a range of channels and formats. Using the 
information gathered we will create a document with the students name, class and grade. The document will be 
kept in the ESL coordinators office so it can be updated regularly through out the year.The Parent Coordinator 
(Mr. Diaz), ESL Coordinator (Ms. Shirley), Guidance(Ms. Perez), as well as other members of the school community 
will ensure that parents understand their rights.

Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

 

 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

P.S/I.S 377 fulfills Section VII of Chancellors Regulations A-663 by providing each parent a copy of the Parents Bill of 
Rights during registration. They are also provided with a school handbook at the beginning of the school year that 
covers all notification requirements. They are also provided with a monthly calendar that notifies them of all monthly 
events at our school.We provide parents notifications in their primary language and during meetings or conferences; 
translators are available to parents. All letters and documents are provided to parents in both English and their Native 
language. As a school community we want to better engage and communicate with Limited English proficient parents 
because we want them to feel that they are involved from the start and ensure that the information we provide 
meets their needs.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

The first step to improving our parent, family, and community involvement in our school is to assemble a team 
composed of the parent coordinator, ESL coordinator and ENL teacher and parent-teacher association members.The 
team begins by assessing the needs of our parents through informal conversations. Our PTA will also be encouraged 
to create a parent group inclusive of all cultures and languages to ensure that all are represented in our school 
community. Once our school has initiated an effort to look carefully at the information gathered about the status of 
our parental needs, priority areas will be identified, tasks assigned, and plans to evaluate progress will be put into 
place.
