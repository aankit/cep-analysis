Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Vision  

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

The students of Battery Park City School are competent, capable, curious and caring individuals who discover the 
unique contributions they will draw upon as they become responsible members of society. Our students are 
lifelong learners prepared to engage in the work of creating new paradigms for an increasingly inclusive and 
sustainable world.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 
Mission 

To make this vision a reality, we nurture the academic, emotional, social, and physical well-being of each child by 
building on their intrinsic strengths. The school community works collaboratively, ensuring that each student has a 
voice and is represented in the curriculum, in order to create an environment of equity and respect for all.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

PS/IS 276, The Battery Park City School, is a preK-8 community school in lower Manhattan.  

Our primary core value is the children whose educations have been entrusted to us. As expressed in our mission 
statement, we provide each student a well-rounded education. We have an intellectually rigorous curriculum that 
allows students to engage their curiosities about the world, building academic skills and content knowledge needed to 
make sense of the world. We also make sure to help each child explore his or her talents through a strong arts 
program (we offer studio art, music and band, and performing arts) and Physical Education. This programming is 
aligned with our school’s mission and vision statement. 

Our school community has a commitment to providing an equitable education to our student body. We know that 
an effective education builds critical and creative thinking skills, strong communication and reasoning skills, 
alongside of the tools needed to be engaged citizens. Typically, students of color, neuro diverse learners, and 
English learners have less access to this rich curriculum. As a school, we believe that an important aspect of 
working towards equity and social justice is to provide all students, including historically marginalized groups, with 
an intellectually rigorous curriculum and the social emotional tools needed for success. When we meet the needs 
of these students more effectively, all our students will benefit.  

Teachers at PS/IS 276 are highly qualified and very dedicated to their students. They have developed our 
curriculum to be engaging to students and aligned to Common Core standards. We offer an exceptionally rich 
curriculum for all students. In each grade, we have units of study that are truly universal in their design. The studies 
are relevant, have a variety of resources in diverse formats and accessibility, and provide students with multiple 
paths to enter the study and to present their findings in personal and creative ways. Studies range from analyzing 
DNA in strawberries in eighth grade science, to studying the ocean in fifth grade, to designing windmills as part of a 
study of Africa in third grade, to an in-depth study of New York Harbor in first grade. We offer two Regents courses, 
Algebra 1 and Living Environment, in 8th grade. This work is the result of tremendous collaboration among teachers 
as they work to create rigorous academic opportunities for our students.  

Teachers eagerly engage in professional learning. They collaboratively participate in study groups with colleagues 
during the year, attend training in math, special education, and history over the summer, and seek out an active 
role in the decision making process in the school. Our school has partnered with several professional learning 
organizations. With support from outside experts, our teachers have developed ELA and math curricula that are 
Common Core aligned and build intellectual rigor for our students. We also engage in professional study alongside 
facilitators from the Teachers College Inclusive Classrooms Project. Through this work, teachers learn about co-
teaching practices, Restorative Justice techniques, and UDL principles to develop accessible curriculum and lessons. 
This professional learning plan allows us to meet the needs of our special student populations as it is individualized 
to support teachers in different grades in creating truly accessible units of study and lessons. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We have 14% Latino, 4% Black students, 20% Asian, 9% multi racial, and 53% White. Additionally, 4% of our 
students receive ENL services and 17% receive special education services. Some students are represented in more 
than one group. Truly a neighborhood school, we welcome students with diverse learning profiles -- children with

autism, various learning challenges, children who are academically gifted, and children who have a range of 
learning strengths and needs  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The element of trust is the component of the Framework for Great Schools that binds our work together. Clear 
communication between all members of our school community is essential to our success in building a community 
based on trust. This communication is multi-directional and means that administration is open to hearing from 
different stakeholders in the school. Our Professional Learning goals and the plan to achieve these goals are jointly 
established with teachers and administration. Parent involvement has also been critical to our success. Our SLT and 
PTA work collaboratively to support and fund enriching programs for students and teachers. We also listen to our 
students and work to build trusting relationships with them.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Our school prides itself on the level of challenge provided to all our students across the disciplines and ability 
levels. Math has been an area of focus for our school. We have a math coach, math teachers in grades 5-8 who are 
content specialists, and we work with internationally recognized math consultants to improve math instruction. In 
the 2017-2018 school year, 78% of our students scored at a level 3 or 4 on the state math tests. This is a significant 
increase over two years ago when 64% of our students scored a level 3 or 4. In an effort to improve math 
achievement, we transitioned last year to accelerating the middle school math curriculum. During our first year of 
offering Algebra 1 Regents to all 8th graders, 79% of all students scored 75 or higher, thus surpassing our target of 
75% set on last year’s CEP. (23% of all students scored 85 or higher with 48% of students scored 90 or higher.) 
However, our students with disabilities did not achieve as well. 46% of these students (7/15) scored 75 or above. 
This was our first year to teach Algebra 1 to all students. These results show that we need to make sure that we are 
providing adequate supports and interventions to our students with disabilities. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 65% of 8th graders with disabilities who complete the Algebra 1 course will score 75% or higher on teh 
Algebra 1 Regents test.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
 

PS/IS276 has a strong social emotional curriculum. In lower grades, teachers use Second Step, a nationally recognized 
social skills curriculum, in middle school, all students participate in an advisory curriculum. Additionally, we have an 
active GSA that arranges community events, celebrate Kindness and Justice during the month of February, use 
mindfulness and restorative justice practices and our teacher-made curriculum deliberately includes multiple voices 
and perspectives. In lower grades, teachers select read alouds that explore themes of diversity and justice.  

On-going efforts to create a safe and supportive environment have resulted in an increase in positive student survey 
responses. Our CEP goal for 2017-18 was that 32% of students will respond that bullying behaviors happen none of 
the time, an increase of 5 percentage points on the School Environment Survey. We met this goal. 68% of students 
say that students rarely or never harass, bully or intimidate other students. This is up from 42% in the 2016-2017 
survey. Additionally, 87% (up from 69%) say that students rarely or never do this due to race, religion, ethnicity, 
national origin, or immigrations status, 83% say this rarely or ever happens due gender or gender identity (up from 
75%), and 76% (up from 61%) say this rarely or never happens due to differences like religion, disability or weight. Our 
positive rating on bullying prevention is 79%. We are committed to continuing to support a positive school 
environment for all.  

A continuing goal is to develop the emotional intelligence of our students. This means we want to help them be more 
aware of their own emotions, emotional responses, and to develop the ability to regulate their emotions for 
productive purposes.  We have several programs to support this goal already in place.  

  

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 83% of students will report positively on our work at bullying prevention on the School Environment 
Survey.

Battery Park City School is fortunate to have a dedicated and professional faculty. Our faculty has deep pedagogical 
knowledge in a range of educational specialities -- social emotional development for young children and adolescents, 
early literacy skills and sophisticated interactions with literature, math intervention programs for struggling learners 
and for students who are highly fluent in mathematical thinking, social studies and history at a range of grade levels, 
science, technology... the list is vast. As a preK to 8 school, we have a unique opportunity to share professional 
knowledge to support student learning in many ways. While 97% of teachers say that principal, teachers, and staff 
collaborate o make the school run effectively, we do not currently tap this expertise as well as we might. Only 73% pf 
teachers report that their colleagues make a conscious effort to coordinate instruction with other grade levels, 77% 
reporting satisfaction with sustained and coherent professional learning, and 84% of teachers report that colleagues 
take responsibility for improving the school. Our overall percentage of positive responses for Innovation and 
Collective Responsibilty on the School Environment Survey is 84% with 89% of teachers reporting overall positive 
responses for peer collaboration. 

The priority goal for this area is to boost opportunities for peer collaboration around professional learning.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
 

By June 2019, teachers will report 90% overall satisfaction on both Innovation and Collective Responsibilty and Peer 
Collaboration on the School Environment Survey.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The school leadership focuses on developing a climate of inclusiveness for students, families and staff. We work 
collaboratively with constituents in the school to build coherent instructional and social-emotional support and to 
support teacher learning by providing targeted, meaningful professional learning opportunities. In the 2017-2018 
School Environment Survey , teachers report 95% satisfaction with teacher influence snd 92% satisfaction with 
instructional leadership. Teachers and parents agree that school leadership communicates a clear vision for the school 
(95%.)  

While teachers have confidence that administration has a pulse on student learning and sets high standards for 
student learning, they feel that administration should participate more in instructional planning (81% satisfaction) and 
desire more sustained and coherent professional development experiences (77% positive response).  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, teachers will report 90% satisfaction with principal support of and participation in professional learning 
on the School Environment Survey.

Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The Battery Park City School community has strong family and school ties. 95% of parents who responded to the 
School Environment Survey reported positive feelings of communication between school and home. 95% of families 
say that their child is safe at school and 91% aggree that the school communicates if there are any emotional of 
psychological issues affecting their children. Through conversations with parents and other feedback, it is clear that 
parents are unclear about the school approach to discipline. Often, it appears that there are no consequences for 
mean behaviors between students. Additionally, parents have asked for more information on Executive Function and 
how to support students in developing positive self-regulation. Additionally, as an inclusive enviornment, students 
sometimes struggle with responding to actions from differently abled peers at school and in the park after school. This 
goal is tied to the safe school goal (5B) above. We want to provide parents with a greater understanding of our school 
approach to discipline, the use of restorative practices, teaching executive functioning to students, and responding to 
poorly regulated behaviors. To that end, we will work on parent education on these and other topics that relate to 
nurturing emotional intelligence in our student body.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, we will have 3 workshops for parents on social emotional skills and how we use these skills to create a 
safer school environment for all students.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33 

 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school.  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Battery Park City School to effectively become involved in planning and decision making in support of the education 
of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school

surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;

grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., NCLB/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.

RATIONALE 
Our Title III direct instructional supplemental program will focus on mathematics instruction. 
While students who are learning English can often calculate effectively, much of 
mathematics education in the US is very language intensive. 
The Common Core Learning Standards emphasize the importance of 
communicating mathematical thinking. Students are expected to make sense of problems, 
persevere,  construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others. The bulk of our ENL 
students in grades 3-8 scored in the mid 2s in proficiency on the 2017-2018 NYS math test.  A 
major challenge on the state tests for our ENL students were the extended responses.  All of our 
8th graders take Algebra 1 as a Regents course. Because of our goal to provide Algebra for All 
and the language intense nature of much of the mathematics instruction in these programs, we 
want to provide additional support to our ENL students.   
SUBGROUPS & GRADE LEVELS OF STUDENTS TO BE SERVEDStudents from all ENL 
subgroups will be served through this supplemental Title III Mathematics Program. This 
program will be offered to ENL and Former ENL students in grades 3-8. In grades 3-8 there are 
12 New Comers, 3 Developing and 9 Former ELLs. In these grades, 4 of the students are also 
Students with Disabilities. We currently have no SIFE or Long Term ELLs in these grade levels. 
PROGRAM DISCRIPTION 
Students will be grouped in 3 grade bands: 3-4, 5-6 & 7-8. These small group supplemental 
lessons will be co-taught by an ENL certified teacher and a math teacher. The instruction will be 
giving using a variety of co-teaching models: parallel teaching, team teaching and station 
teaching. Instruction will be based around “youcubed.org,” a math education forum from 
Stanford University and Math Exemplars. Within these groups, students will be working in small 
groups and partnerships based on heterogeneous language levels and mathematic abilities. 
Students will develop their understanding of math vocabulary and language through group 
projects and partner activities. Students will also participate in the Mathematical Mindset 
Algebra curriculum unit.  This unit draws up on algebraic research that students become more 
mathematically flexible when they learn to solve for patterns rather than solve for x. These math 
lessons are designed for multiple grade levels and have 20 lessons in the unit. These lessons will 
be planned for and distributed across the 13 sessions of the ENL Supplemental Mathematics 
Program.  The lessons also include teaching students about growth mindset and were designed in 
collaboration with Carol Dweck. This curriculum is separate from our regular math curriculum 
and will build the skills, mindset, and conceptual knowledge necessary for success in higher 
math.   
SCHEDULE & DURATIONStudents will be invited to participate in 13 sessions of our Title III 
ENL Supplemental Mathematics Program. These sessions will be on Wednesdays and Thursdays 
after school from 2:45-4:15 on the following dates: 
January: 9th,10th, 16th, 17th, 23rd, 24th 
February: 6th,7th, 13th, 14th, 27th, 28th

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
This program will be taught in English with Native Language supports. 
Number and Types of Certified Teachers 
This program will be taught by 3 teams of 2 teachers. Each team will consist of 1 ENL Certified 
teacher and 1 teacher specializing in math. Teachers will use a variety of co-teaching models and 
participating in instructional time throughout each session. All ENL students in the Title III 
enrichment program will receive at least 50% of direct instruction from a certified ENL teacher. 
The 6 teachers participating in instructing this program will also be participating in the Title III 
professional development sessions. These sessions focus on phonics/phonemic awareness as well 
as rigorous instruction for culturally diverse students. These sessions will develop teachers’ 
ability to support students with navigating mathematical language. 
Types of Materials: The materials utilized through this program will be distinct from students’ 
daily mathematics instruction. Students will utilize technology (computers/ipads) that are used in 
daily instruction.

RATIONAL 
Our Professional Development program for teachers who work with ENL students is dually 
focused. As a preK to 8 school, our ENL population is truly diverse.  We 
have preK and kindergarten students who speak multiple languages at home 
and are acquiring spoken English while they are also building early literacy skills.  We 
also have students at commanding levels of spoken and written English in our upper grades as 
well as recent arrivals who are still navigating their silent phases. The home cultures of 
our students are equally diverse.  Students come from Greece, China, Russia, 
Brazil and Mexico among other countries.   
Given this context and an analysis of the historic early literacy skills of 
our ENL learners over time and the needs of our older learners, we are planning two tracks for 
professional learning to support our ENL students. Both of these tracks are designed to be "of 
sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on the teachers’ 
performance in classrooms." Track 1 will focus on Phonics and Phonemic awareness for ELLs 
and Track 2 will focus on promoting engagement and rigor for linguistically 
and culturally diverse learners. These professional development sessions will give our teachers 
instructional methods to help our ENL students develop the literacy skills necessary to succeed 
across content and grade levels. 
TEACHERS TO RECEIVE TRAINING 
Track 1: PHONICS & PHONEMIC AWARENESS FOR ELLs 
This professional development track will be co-developed and facilitated by a licensed ENL 
teacher and our early literacy specialist.  This professional development series will focus on 
instruction in phonics and phonemic awareness for our ELL 
students who are acquiring emergent literacy behaviors in grade K-2. Teachers will become 
familiar with the following: Words their Way assessments, Fountas and Pinnell assessments, 
Fundations, and Sounds in Motion. These professional developments will be facilitated by our 
early literacy specialist, an ENL licensed teacher and the elementary assistant principal. Teachers

Part C: Professional Development  
in grades preK to 2nd grade will participate. Currently we have 1 preK teacher, 5 Kindergarten 
teachers, 5 1st grade teachers and 5 2nd grade teachers.  
Track 2: Promoting Engagement and Rigor for Linguistically and Culturally Diverse Learners. 
This work will include an understanding of the impacts of 
linguistic diversity and how teachers can build on the funds of 
knowledge and skills our ENL learners bring to our community.  A key text in this work will be 
Zaretta Hammond's Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain.  These professional 
developments will be facilitated by our diversity coordinator, an ENL certified teacher and the 
middle school assistant principal. Teachers in all grades will participate. 
SCHEDULE AND DURATION 
Track 1: This professional development series will take place over 6 sessions from 4pm – 5pm 
on Monday afternoons. January 7, 14, 28, February 4, 11, and 25. 
Track 2: This professional development series will take place over 8 sessions from 4pm-5pm on 
Tuesday afternoons. January 8, 15, 22, 28 and February 5 and 12.   

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities

Parents who are new to the United States school system need help in 
understanding instructional approaches used in the US. These can be 
significantly different from their own experiences as students in school and as parents of 
students in other countries.  They are also aware of the challenges their children face in 
new schools and are eager to support them.  We will offer workshops for parents on 
supporting their young children's early literacy skill acquisition, on 
mathematics instructional models that their children are experiencing, and on 
how they can support their older children to achieve academic success.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
All ENL students in primary and middle school grades are continually assessed by their classroom teachers, ENL teachers and 
content area teachers. These teachers conduct one-on-one conferences, administer on demand writing tasks, take observation 
notes, administer running records, as well as a variety of teacher created assessments. 
The results of these assessments are shared amongst educators to guide instructional planning. In the primary grades all 
students, including ELLs, are assessed using the same tools in math and reading. In reading we use: The Concepts about Print, 
Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessments, the Independent Reading Assessment (Serravallo)  and teacher created math 
inventory assessments. Writing assessments include on demand activities and workshop based writing assignments.  We use 
the Writing Pathways rubrics to assess writing.   
In addition, ELL students are assessed using the Rigby ELL assessment Kit for Primary Students.  Spanish speaking ENL students 
who demonstrate literacy challenges can be assessed using the F & P Spanish benchmarks by our Spanish teachers, one of 
whom is ENL certified and the other who is certified as a dual language teacher. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

All students in the middle school are assessed throughout the year. In addition to the assessments mentioned above, middle 
school students who are determined to be at risk are also assessed using the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessments and 
the Independent Reading Assessment (Serravallo). These assessments are analyzed to best inform teachers' instructional 
planning and goals for all students, including ELLs.    
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

There is a collaborative effort across classrooms, grades and subjects to create a cohesive learning environment that includes 
meaningful assessments. Teachers share their knowledge and work together to create assessments that inform their 
instructional practices. Teachers are given time after school and during the day each week to meet in grade teams. Teachers 
also meet with instructional coaches in math and reading to develop meaningful assessments, analyze the results and plan 
instruction based on assessment results. Teachers also work together by conducting these assessments together and share 
their knowledge in order for teachers to collaborate in supporting student learning and making instructional decisions.   
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
All students, including ELLs are given formal and informal assessments to identify baseline, progress being made and areas of 
need. Some of these include pre-unit assessments, ongoing check ins for progress, end of unit projects and papers, NYS tests 
(Math, ELA, Science, NYSESLAT, NYSITELL and HLA Assessments for Spanish), rubrics, presentations, exit tickets and checklists. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once data has been gathered, this information is shared and discussed by teachers and administration to better understand 
what supports individual students and groups of students need. Teachers meet during designated after school meetings and 
follow a discussion protocol to address intervention needs for individual students. Staff also meets as an RTI team, and as 
groups of specialists to create plans for interventions to support students. In addition, grade level teams meet weekly to 
discuss curriculum planning and identify changes that need to be made based on the data.   
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Our school analyzes data from formal assessments (Fountas & Pinnell Benchmark Levels, mathematics assessments, NYS 
scores  and Performance Task Assessments) as well as informal assessments such as one-on-one conferencing and student 
observations to create a learning profile for our ELL students to determine if additional intervention is necessary.  Our 
classroom teachers work to have strong, tier 1 instruction including linguistic and visual prompts and technology tools to 
support ENLs.   
In addition, staff meets in small groups to brainstorm additional tier 2 interventions for students. These interventions are put 
in place for students and then revisited by the team to evaluate their success. If it is determined that a student is in need of 
further interventions, the RTI team looks at this data and conferences about the student. The RTI team then creates an 
intervention plan for that student. The ENL teachers' expertise along with the ELL professional development given to staff 
ensures that ENL specific strategies are implemented for our ELL students. Once an intervention plan is put in place we 
monitor progress over time to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions and adjust as necessary. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
We use both the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT data along with information from ELA and Math state assessments to evaluate and 
inform our ENL programs. We also evaluate the success of our program for ELLs by comparing ELL subgroups with their 
English-speaking peers. We monitor the social and emotional growth of our ELL students, including their peer interactions 
during recess, lunch and academic work times. Teachers are asked to give feedback regarding the ENL program. Each year we 
strive to meet the AYP goals, if we are not able to achieve these goals, we will look back at our teaching strategies and 
programing and reassess and make adjustments to our ELL programs.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

 

The ENL teachers meet with all teachers to share data regarding our ENL program. Teachers meet to discuss how to best meet 
ENL students' needs based on this data and adjust the ENL program accordingly. Data for ENL students is also available for all 
teachers of ELLs on a centrally based electronic location.   

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

We strive to create an ENL program that is based on CR Part 154.2 and most effectively meets the needs of our ELL 
students with our current resources. Students are programmed based on their proficiency level from either the 
NYSITELL or the prior Springs' NYSESLAT. Students that are mandated for Standalone, receive this instruction in a 
groups that are ungraded and heterogeneous. Students mandated for Integrated ENL receive instruction that is 
collaboratively taught by the ENL teacher and the content area teacher. Instruction is delivered to ELLs in a variety of 
content areas, depending on scheduling, student groupings and student needs.     

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A   

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

We use the guidelines from CR Part 154 and we program class schedules and student schedules accordingly in STARS. This 
ensures that all mandated minutes are explicitly accounted for and that these are integrated within content area instruction as 
well as English language skills. We have a literacy block of a minimum of 180 minutes, which is inclusive or all components of 
balanced literacy. 
In addition, ENL is taught in small group instruction for Entering, Emerging and Transitioning students for the total mandated 
minutes.  ENL integrated instruction is included as part of the literacy block and the content area instruction as teachers plan 
for content and language goals using data and CCLS standards (inclusive all 4 modalities). Mandated number of minutes for 
students in ENL Integrated and Standalone programs, are also tracked and scheduled using the guidelines from CR Part 154, 
into the STARS Classroom Programming. ENL instruction and ELA instruction is provided during the 180 minutes literacy blocks 
and an additional block for ENL for students who are in the Entering, Emerging and Transitioning stages. The students receive 
targeted instruction that builds upon oral language development and English literacy skills through explicit teaching addressing 
all four modalities. Our former ELLs receive their mandated minutes via two pathways. Some FELLs receive instruction via 
Alternative Pathway Option A: Small-Group learning or Alternative Pathway Option D: Integrated ENL instruction. 
   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
      We are using the same best practices for all children inclusive of ELLs in all content areas. Use of the Standalone and 
Integrated models ensure that students receive linguistic support in a variety of content areas, including literacy, math, science 
and social studies. The ENL teacher co-teaches into literacy, math, science and social studies periods in the lower grades and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

supports work across various subject areas in middle school. The ENL teacher provides materials and supports for the 
classroom teachers to use throughout the units in all content areas. Content areas are also integrated so that all classes 
support literacy, math, science, and social science concepts. Content area instruction is delivered in English with appropriate 
native language supports. We use a hands-on, inquiry-based approach to learning across all content areas with instructional 
supports for language learners. All lessons are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. Scaffolds for ELLs include: -
Clear oral language models for students-Realia-Visual supports which remain consistent throughout the school community (ex. 
Picture word walls)-Technology (Smartboards, photos, videos)-Total Physical Response-Dramatization-Gestures-Music-
Language games and speaking practice-Clear modeling by the teacher and other students.-Materials in the students’ native 
languages-Explicit vocabulary and grammar instruction-Student interaction and various groupings-Integration of all language 
skills (reading, writing, speaking, and listening) 
 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

      Upon entering our school, all English Language Learners are given the opportunity to produce work in their native language, 
as an assessment of their academic ability to analyze when possible by a staff member who is literate in that language in order 
to  assess literacy skills and language proficiency.  Students with a home language of Spanish are tested with the Spanish LAB-
R. Throughout the year, students are given opportunities to use books, dictionaries and materials to support their home 
language development. The ENL teacher and classroom teachers conference with the students throughout the year to 
evaluate their home language needs as their English language skills progress.      
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

PS/IS 276 recognizes the instructional needs of the various ELL subgroups and has the following plans in place to meet the 
needs of these students: A)Plan for SIFE students:The plan for SIFE students is the following:After a student is identified as 
SIFE  that student's academic skills are further assessed by the school's reading coaches, math coach, ENL teacher and 
classroom teachers. In addition, the guidance counselor meets with the student to get a better understanding of the child. This 
gives us a more holistic picture of that student and gives us the ability to create an individualized, differentiated learning plan 
for that student. When possible, we will pair a SIFE student with a classmate who speaks the same native language. We also 
utilize follow-along audio books and online books with print and picture support. We also have picture dictionaries and other 
picture books and texts in a variety of languages as well as with no text at all, to facilitate early literacy skills. SIFE students will 
also meet regularly with the classroom teacher, ENL teacher and other specialists for small group and one-on-one support. We 
will also meet regularly with the child's parents/guardians to communicate student progress. All ELLs receive testing 
accommodations throughout the year.  B) Plan for ELLs in US Schools less than 3 years (Newcomers):For our Newcomers, who 
tend to be the majority of our students, we provide differentiated instruction as classroom teachers and the ENL teacher 
intentionally co-plan for literacy, content, and language objectives. Newcomers to this country receive mandated 360 minutes 
or 180 minutes of ENL instruction per week (based on level) in the Standalone and/or Integrated ENL model.  Entering, 
Emergent, and Transitioning students are provided with daily explicit language instruction in heterogenous and homogenous 
grouping through shared reading and inquiry based tasks that support the targeted linguistic need. This is in addition to the 
integrated ENL instruction. Teachers differentiate by planning for language demands based on analysis of text complexity and 
student needs for all ELLs. ELLs who are in the Advanced and Commanding Stages, are also provided with targeted integrated 
ENL instruction based on literacy, and linguistic data, throughout the content areas and literacy periods. Teachers also utilized 
proven ENL strategies such as TPR, interactive lesson plans and realia support. Teachers focus on developing both BICs and 
CALP  in their instruction and targeting comprehension strategies. All ELLs receive testing accommodations throughout the 
year.  C) Plan for ELLs receiving service 4 to 6 years (Developing):Students who are Developing ELLs receive additional targeted 
instruction / intervention provided by the ENL  teacher according to the  RTI for ELLs model- Tier 2 services. These students 
receive ENL instruction in the Standalone and/or Integrated ENL model (based on level). Developing ELLs receive targeted 
individual instruction according to their results in the various modalities identified on the NYSESLAT. Students are taught in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

small group settings as well as one-on-one to increase their opportunity to utilize the different modalities. Students in grades 
2-8 receive additional instructional support in small groups from their classroom teacher. The ENL teacher focuses on 
increased vocabulary and comprehension strategies. All ELLs will receive testing accommodations throughout the year.  D) 
Plan for Long-term ELLs (completed 6 years):Students who are are Long-term ELLs receive ENL instruction according to their 
proficiency levels in the Integrated and/or Standalone ENL model. Additionally, Long-term ELLs will receive targeted individual 
instruction according to their results on the various modalities identified on the NYESESLAT and the results of their other 
NYSAA assessments. These students are taught in whole-class, small group and one-on-one conferences to increase their 
opportunities to utilize the different modalities of the English language and get targeted instruction. Long-term ELLs will 
receive increased academic vocabulary instruction, weekly word work, targeted comprehension strategies and receive at risk 
services with the appropriate specialists (based on individual student needs). All ELLs will also receive ELL testing 
accommodations throughout the year.  E) Plan for Former ELLs  (In years 1 and 2 after testing proficient): Former ELLs will 
receive their mandated service via two options from the Alternative Pathways, either 2 years of Integrated ENL for 90 minutes 
a week or small-group instruction for at least 90 minutes per week in one of the following areas: guided reading or writing, 
word work/vocabulary or content area work. The ENL teacher is also be in communication with the classroom teachers to 
provide supports and scaffolds for FELLs. These supports include modifications for assignments, resources in the child's native 
language and small group work with the ELL teachers when they meet with other students at a similar proficiency level in 
terms of literacy skills and language acquisition. FELLs also receive ELL testing modifications on assessments.      
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 All of our ELL-SWDs have individualized instruction goals and are working with several staff members, including the special 
education teachers, literacy specialists and speech specialists to help them reach those goals. These teachers and staff 
collaborate together to plan for language and literacy outcomes for ELL-SWDs that align with their IEP goals while supporting 
their English language acquisition. These students receive additional services and support in content areas through SETTS and 
ICT programming which also include language goals.  All teachers utilize the appropriate grade level, school developed 
curriculum based on the CCLS to plan their units and differentiate instruction based on these units of studies. Teachers utilize 
grade level texts, native language supports (books, dictionaries and translations), guided reading based on the Japanese Lesson 
Study and individualized literacy instruction based on F&P benchmark levels. Teachers utilize Smartboard technology, 
computer based literacy and math programs as well as ipads to enhance student learning.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The ENL teacher, content education teachers and specialists collaborate regularly to provide our ELL-SWDs with extra 
strategies and skill instruction as well as language support. Interventions for these ELLs include: small group instruction, one-
on-one support, glossaries and direct vocabulary instruction, organizational supports such as checklists and reminders in a 
prominent and consistent location in the classroom, homework help, alternate assessments and assignments, graphic 
organizers, and specific lessons on skills and strategies. These interventions are used across all content areas. These students 
are also offered the opportunity to meet with the ENL teachers for extra instruction and language support either before or 
after school or during lunch. This flexible programming is used to ensure that our ELL-SWDs can achieve their IEP goals while 
accelerating their English language development in the least restrictive setting.     
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
 Data used to identify students for targeted intervention programs include: NYSESLAT data, other NYSA data in ELA and Math, 
and student performance on curriculum-based in-class assessments. ELLs receive targeted interventions in Math, Science, 
Social Studies and ELA. These interventions include: small group instruction, one-on-one support, glossaries and direct 
vocabulary instruction, organizational supports such as checklists and reminders in a prominent and consistent location in the 
classroom, homework help, alternate assessments and assignments, graphic organizers, and specific lessons on skills and 
strategies. These interventions are used across all content areas for all ELL students. When necessary, students who need extra

support in reading and writing are assigned to work with a reading intervention teacher. All instruction is in English with native 
language supports. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We are continuing to improve our co-planning, co-teaching and communication strategies so that ENL methodology is 
incorporated into all lessons even when the ENL teacher is not present. We are also improving our use of technology as a tool 
in the classroom and to communicate and collaborate with teachers and parents. Towards the end of the school year we will 
be looking at student data to make appropriate programmatic and staffing decisions for next year. Based on our increasing 
number of ENL students,  we will seek out dual licensed (ENL/General Ed, Special Ed) and AIS teachers for the following school 
year 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

n/a     
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
As a result of our collaborative decisions, ELLs are afforded the same opportunities as all students in the school and are invited 
to participate through classroom notices and emails that are provided in the parents' preferred home language. These 
programs including participation in the after school program run by Manhattan Youth, newspaper, student government, class 
field trips, including trips to Frost Valley and the 7th and 8th grade overnight class trips and participation in the Battery Park 
Urban Farm. 
All students also participate in the Science Fair, Music Concert and Art Show. Most of our ELLs participate in all of these 
activities. In addition, a variety of lunch clubs are available for students, including ELLs, to participate in. These include, but are 
not limited to: library club, board game club and chess club.  
The Standalone ENL class is scheduled during a time of the day when students do similar work in their classroom such as word 
study and literacy activities. The students who are pulled out are receiving instruction similar to what they would receive in the 
classroom in a smaller, more focused setting. The ENL teacher coordinates standalone lessons with the classroom curriculum. 
The students are not missing special activities or other content classes. When necessary, students who need extra support in 
reading and writing are assigned to work with a reading intervention teacher. ELLs are also afforded the opportunities to 
participate in band, Spanish, flag football, various after school clubs including environmental club, cooking and chess, amongst 
other choices 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
 We have purchased bilingual books and materials for our classrooms that reflect the multilingualism and multiculturalism of 
our school community. Classroom books and materials are available in the following languages: Spanish, French, Portuguese, 
Korean, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Lithuanian, Tagalog, and Chinese. We use Rigby’s On Our Way to English 
and English in my Pocket programs for Kindergarten newcomers as well as Gear Up Guided Reading with ELL support. Teachers 
also use Leveled Literacy Instruction books and Fundations for children who need additional support in reading. We also utilize 
the Rigby, On Our Way to English guided reading instructional kits. We also have Reading Recovery teachers and reading 
intervention teachers that provide additional support in reading. All classrooms are equipped with Smartboards, iMac 
desktops and laptops, iPads programmed with language applications and speakers for the students’ use. The technology is 
used throughout lessons for direct instruction and independent and group work. The ENL teachers and classroom teachers also 
create many materials to scaffold instruction for ELLs and bilingual students. These materials include: vocabulary cards, sight 
word cards and rings, individual sight word folders, graphic organizers, checklists and reminder sheets, games and other 
materials that are specifically designed to meet each students' needs. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

 Although instruction is delivered mostly in English, students are encouraged to use their native language with peers and for 
clarification. When possible, teachers and staff members can interpret for students. Students who are able to use bilingual 
dictionaries are taught and encouraged to use them in class. Parents are also encouraged to use their native language to 
support student work at home. We also use picture cards that have multiple language translations to instruct newcomers. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

Students are encouraged to celebrate their native languages and cultures with their peers and teachers. Technology, such as 
electronic translators and bilingual dictionary websites are also used as appropriate. We do not have a TBE or Dual Language 
program. All of the supports are in addition to the English instruction delivered through the ENL model.    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

 All services and resources used correspond to the age and grade level of students. The ENL teacher works closely with the 
content teachers to align their work to the grade-level and age appropriate materials. This collaboration allows teachers to 
create supports that are appropriate for students’ grades, ages and proficiency level. Our school also has special education 
teachers on every grade level to provide support within the classrooms.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our school shares a building with a P94@276, a District 75 program for students on the autism spectrum. Administrations from 
both schools create a plan for shared buildings space (lunchroom, school yard, auditorium and gym). Each school has separate 
staff and specialists.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
 ELL families are included in school functions prior to the beginning of the school year. Parents were provided with information 
about summer programs and invited to all pre-school year events. They were also given the opportunity to meet personally 
with the principal and school faculty members with translators provided if necessary. As soon as an ELL is identified as such, 
the ENL teacher meets or speaks with the parents to describe the schools support programs for ELLs.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

  Spanish is currently the only foreign language class offered at our school. Spanish instruction is provided and required for 
students in grades first through seventh. The only exceptions are beginner and intermediate ELLs who receive extra English 
support in place of Spanish class. .    
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 There are a variety of professional development opportunities for personnel that work with ELLs. These include: OELL 
workshops, BETAC workshops, and PDs provided by PS/IS 276 and other organizations advised by the OELL and District 2 ELL 
Support Team. These workshops include workshops for secretaries and other support staff personnel. The administration 
greatly supports professional development and ongoing learning opportunities for staff. Teachers are able to turnkey what 
they have learned from attending various PD workshops so other teachers may implement some of those strategies into their 
own lesson planning. The ENL teacher collaborates with a variety of ENL teachers from different schools. These teachers share 
best practices and assist one another in implementing them at their individual schools. Common branch and content area 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

teachers receive ELL PD at PS/IS 276 on Monday afternoons during Professional Development based on Pauline Gibbons book, 
Scaffolding Language, Scaffolding Learning: Teaching Second Language Learners in the Mainstream Classroom. Parent 
coordinators, secretaries and other staff are invited to attend these PDs. The ENL teachers and all teachers of ELLs also attend 
professional development workshops that focus on The Common Core Learning Standards, teaching ELLs, language acquisition, 
and best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for ELLs. Additionally,  the ENL 
teacher works one-on-one with teachers to address specific needs in each classroom and subject area. All staff, including 
subject area teachers, paraprofessionals, guidance counselors, special education teachers, psychologists, occupational/physical 
therapists, speech therapists, secretaries, and parent coordinators are given specific training on how to work with ELLs and 
their families.  
Additionally, as part of our Title III program, teachers will participate in two tracks of professional development. Track 1 will 
focus on instruction in phonics and phonemic awareness for our students who are acquiring emergent literacy  behaviors in 
grade K-2. Our early literacy specialist and an ENL licensed teacher who teaches in our early grades will co-develop and 
facilitate this PD along with our elementary school assistant principal. It will be presented to teachers who work in grades preK 
to 2 to support the English learning and literacy development of students who are learning English drawing upon Words their 
Way assessments, Fountas and Pinnell assessments, Fundations, and Sounds in Motion. This will be a 6 week series that meets 
for two hours every other week from November through January. 
Track 2 will focus on promoting engagement and rigor for linguisitically and culturally diverse learners. This work will include 
an understanding of the impacts of linguistic diversity and how teachers can build on the funds of knowledge and skills our ENL 
learners bring to our community.  A key text in this work will be Zaretta Hammond's Culturally Responsive Teaching and the 
Brain.  Our diversity coordinator, Mary Valentine,  will work with the middle school assistant principal, Nico Victorino, and our 
ENL teacher, Gretchen Rada, to develop this series that will be offered to teachers who work with our students who are 
learning English.  It will take place over 8 weeks for an hour each week from the end of January through March. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 The ELL Coordinator and principal will provide school-based PD sessions based on the text by Pauline Gibbons, Scaffolding 
Language, Scaffolding Learning: Teaching Second Language Learners in the Mainstream Classroom, for all faculty members 
throughout the school year. These PDs will focus on analyzing resources to identify language barriers and adapting lessons to 
provide linguistic scaffolding, strategies for making instruction in English accessible for all learners, and planning lessons and 
units that follow the SIOP (sheltered instruction) model with both content and linguistic objectives. These PDs will take place 
throughout the year on Mondays during our Professional Development sessions. These in-school workshops will also address 
models of co-teaching as a method of maximizing the benefits of our push-in model of support. We will also provide teachers 
with information on ELL workshops outside of the school. The principal maintains a record of all Professional Development 
provided on Mondays by retaining the agendas and attendance for meetings. These are documented and kept in the 
principal's office.  
    
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Our school provides the annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs during our Parent Communication time, which takes 
place every Tuesday and Thursday morning from 8:00-8:20am. After winter recess, The ENL teacher will email or call using the 
interpretation services (if necessary), an invitation to parents/guardians to schedule individual meetings  during this time.

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

 School family events are inclusive of all families, including families of children who speak a language other than English at 
home. New ELL families were invited to attend school functions prior to the beginning of the school year. Parents are provided 
with information about summer programs and invited to all school events. They are also given the opportunity to meet 
personally with the principal and school faculty members. Specific parent involvement opportunities include: volunteering in 
the classroom, volunteering in the lunchroom, attending extracurricular school events, Family Friday events and teaching 
about special family traditions or knowledge. All parents, inclusive of parents of ELLs, are invited to participate in parent 
committees such as the Wellness Committee, the Outreach Committee, the Auction Committee, the PTA, the SLT.  
This year we will also offer three workshops for parents of ELLs. We will offer workshop for parents on supporting their young 
children's early literacy skill acquisition, on mathematics instructional models that their children are experiencing, and on how 
they can support their older children to help them achieve academic success. These workshops will be co-facilitated by an ENL 
licensed staff and topic specialists.  
Simultaneous interpreters were provided, as necessary, for parents at this event. At our school’s Curriculum Nights, the ELL 
coordinators were available to speak to all parents about the value the school places on multilingualism and their role as an 
ELL teacher in the school. When official letters go home, these letters are sent home in home languages as well as English. All 
of the ELL parents were encouraged to request information in their home languages, but many of our parents prefer to receive 
all communication in English. A separate orientation meeting was held for families of ELL children. Simultaneous interpreters 
were provided, as necessary, for parents at this event. At our school’s Curriculum Nights, the ELL coordinators were available 
to speak to all parents about the value the school places on multilingualism and their role as an ELL teacher in the school.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Theresa Ruyter, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

In the main office a Language Identification Guide is posted to help staff identify the language of a limited-English-
proficient parent. There is also a multilingual Welcome Poster at the entrance of the school. At registration, 
parents are assisted in filling out the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) form where they indicate their 
preferred language of communication in Part III. Additionally, parents complete a Preferred Language form, a 
copy of which is kept on file in the ENL Coordinators office as well as in the child’s cum folder. After a parent has 
completed their HLIS form, entries for preferred language are entered in ATS to indicate the language commonly 
used at home and for which all communications should be provided by the school. Parents are also able to 
indicate their preferred language of communication on their Blue Emergency Contact cards.

Our school helps make limited-English Proficient parents aware of their right to receive information by posting the 
items provided by the Language Access Kit: Posters and brochures. Additionally, during Parent Orientations, PTA 
meetings and other events, parents are made aware of their right to receive information in their preferred language. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Our school will gather both formal and informal feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services. After 
a translation or interpreter is used the teacher/staff/administration will informally inquire about the quality of the 
services provided. At the end of the year, the school will send out a survey to parents via email (translated as needed) 
to more formally analyze the quality of the services provided.
