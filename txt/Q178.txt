Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our school's mission is "As educators, we believe that all children have the ability to meet or exceed standards by 
being part of a nurturing educational environment that challenges students to reach their full potential. At the 
Holliswood School, we promote an environment that encourages open communication among all constituents, where 
every staff member, student, and parent is a proactive participant in contributing to the school's success. Our goal is 
to cultivate a haven where students are always engaged, empowered, and recognized for their unique abilities." 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

At 178, we have defined what engagement looks like, sounds like, and feels like and use this definition of engagement 
as a beacon to guide our work and our conversations about how children learn best. Our school-wide definition of 
engagement is as follows: "At 178Q student learning is impacted by lifting the level of engagement socially, physically, 
and cognitively. Engagement is elevated when the instructional experiences provide students with opportunities to 
tackle real world problems, take appropriate risks, and explore activities at a deeper and more authentic level. The 
ultimate goal is to foster student agency through an environment that promotes effective collaboration, student 
ownership, and choice. When engagement is strengthened, productive struggle occurs and leads to a school 
community of citizens heading towards global and personal awareness."  

Our school vision is, "Collectively PS/IS 178 will continue to provide ALL children with rich experiences and rigorous 
instruction in and out of the classroom so they may be prepared to reach their greatest potential, build their curiosity 
of the world before them, and the tenacity to excel in this global society of the 21st century. We will do this by 
continuing to strengthen our home-school partnership, further developing and supporting our teachers’ pedagogical 
skills, and maintaining a safe and responsive environment for all to learn and grow." 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Our school is comprised of approximately 570 students in grades Pre-K through 8th grade. 14% Asian, 7% Black, 10% 
Hispanic, 66% White, 2% Other. 6% of our students are ENL students and 14% of our students receive special 
education. 

Our school's core values are: 

-Excellence 

-Equity 

-Empathy 

-Exploratory Learning  

All of the learning opportunities at the Holliswood school embody these four core values. 

Our students are beginning to take ownership of these academic and personal behaviors and they carry through into 
all other aspects of school and personal life. As a result, students are taking greater responsibility for their own 
learning. Students can articulate their strengths and areas in need of improvement, as well as their goals and learning 
targets. Students can self-reflect and also provide feedback to a peer, while incorporating their teacher’s feedback as 
well.  

In order to prepare all of our students for college and careers we begin at the elementary level embedding our four 
core values into the curricula and all opportunities that foster collaboration and socialization. We focus on teaching 
culturally responsive curriculum and providing an educational program that is both targeted to the individual and 
inclusive of all. Multiple enrichment, extra-curricular activities, and service-related activities are offered throughout 
our classes and across grades. 

Our school provides clear expectations for all. The administrative cabinet models clear expectations for our faculty 
through consistent communication via regular weekly announcements, collaborative instructional walk-throughs, 
regular feedback to and from colleagues, cycles of observation, faculty professional development, one-to-one or small 
group conferences, written reports and through coaching. 

Our school services a wide range of ages (4 to 14 years of age) and therefore, needs to consider the developmental 
needs of each of these stages in order to create learning opportunities that are cognitively socially and emotionally 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

challenging students in healthy ways so they may be prepared for the global society. At 178Q this takes the following 
forms: 

1.  Our Pre-K program has been identified as a Showcase School for the New York City Department of Education 
emphasizing our work with the city's Equity and Excellence initiative with Pre-K for All. Our youngest learners 
are engaging in curriculum that is inquiry-based allowing for multiple opportunities to engage in problem 
solving, collaboration, and questioning of the world and the way things work. It is developmentally 
appropriate and play-based, and is grounded in a supportive Responsive Classroom approach focused on 
building self-regulation skills and growing independence and agency. Instilling Equity and Excellence is not 
only a city-wide marker for student success but is the school-wide vision for 178Q. 
ICT programs exist on every grade providing children healthy and challenging environments to learn in 
providing students with the adequate supports needed to access the curriculum, develop academic habits of 
mind, and develop a mindset grounded in inclusion, empathy, and collaboration; skill-sets needed to be 
successful in the global society.  

2. 

3.  Middle School Students engage in specialty courses preparing students for college and career readiness. Such 

courses are: The debate team, Interdisciplinary Computer Science & Robotics, Technology Open Lab, 
Advisory, National Junior Honor Society, Specialized Library Research course, and Endeavor- STEM Career 
Exploration. We recognize it is important to build up this first fully STEM literate generation and empower 
these learners with the knowledge they need to form and fuel their future career pathways. Therefore, we 
provide them with opportunities to engage in global networking and explorations of international math 
models with their library research course and provide learners opportunities to connect their individual skills 
and interest to a variety of in-demand STEM careers through their Endeavor-STEM Career Exploration course. 
Highlighted careers include: Mechanical Engineering Technician, UI Designer, CNC Machinist, Hardware 
Technician, etc.  

4.  PS/IS 178 is also part of the College Access for All and the Algebra for All (5th grade and beyond) initiatives 

providing teachers and students opportunities to prepare for and explore colleges and careers as well as build 
the competencies necessary to be on track for colleges and careers. In addition to the College Access for All 
and Algebra for All initiatives, students in the middle school grades prepare for and take the Algebra regents, 
Living Environment regents, and Spanish proficiency exams before completing eighth grade. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our school is comprised of 6% of English as a New Language Learners (ENLs), 14% IEP Students, with an ICT class on 
every grade. We also service two PK classes where we meet the developmental needs and language acquisition needs 
of three and four year olds. Our students' demographics are made up of the following: 

  White - 68% 
  Asian or Pacific Islander - 12% 
  Hispanic - 10% 
  Black - 7% 
  Multiracial - 2% 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Last school year, our school worked to address all of the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, with special 
attention to "Supportive Environment." It was essential to continue to develop a supportive environment in our Pre-K 
to 8 School. We also focused heavily on "Strong Family-Community Ties." Therefore, students, staff, and 
parents/guardians worked arduously to ensure community support and community involvement was maximized. For 
example, our Student Council and National Junior Honor Society Members contributed their efforts to bring the 
community into our school on events, such as multicultural Night. fund-raising for the Ronald McDonald House 
Foundation, and the No Place for Hate Movement with the Anti-Defamation League.

This year, we would like to focus on "Rigorous Instruction," as the feedback from our Quality Review and school walk-
throughs highlighted the need for improvement in pedagogy and instruction. We would like to amplify the level of 
academic rigor in every classroom and throughout the school with a particular focus on writing and the use of 
formative assessments to drive instructional decisions around differentiated and targeted groupings in order to build 
agency and student ownership of learning.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Running Records conducted during the end of the 2018 school year reveal that 77% of our students across grade 3-8 
are reading on or above grade level. By June of 2018 74% of the students across all grades (K-8) are reading on or 
above grade level as measured by TCRWP running records; which is a 5% decrease since June of 2017. While running 
records only assess comprehension and fluency, the NYS ELA assessment also assess students' ability to write about 
reading. The 2018 Spring ELA results reveal that 59.7% of students attained proficiency; an increase of almost 8% 
from 2017. Despite the increase in proficiency, students with disabilities have still not made any gains in proficiency 
maintaining a 9% increase in 2018 as was in 2017. 

An analysis of the 2018 New York State (NYS) math data reveals that students could further develop their ability to 
solve math problems and construct viable arguments in mathematics. The 2018 New York State math data revealed a 
4% decrease in proficiency for students across grades 3-7 (excluding 8th grade since 8th graders took the Algebra 
regents). While there was an overall 4% decrease, this decrease was mostly impacted by the decrease in proficiency in 
grades 5-7. The data further reveals that students with disabilities had the greatest impact on this decrease with a 
proficiency rate of 12%; a drop from 2017 where the proficiency rate was 20%. 

In the 2017-2018 school environment survey in the area of rigor, 82% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that in 
planning their last instructional unit for general/self-contained/literacy/science/social studies, they had the resources 
and tools they need to include multiple opportunities for reading and writing experiences grounded in evidence from 
text, both literary and informational. Starting the 2018-2019 school year all literacy teachers in grades K-8 will have 
full access and resources to the TC reading and writing curriculum as well as TC coaching and teachers in grades K-2 
will also have a literacy coach from the Universal Literacy initiative. Additionally grades 4-8 are departmentalized and 
therefore, teachers receive supports and professional development in one specific discipline which is expected to lead 
to an increase in the percent of teachers agreeing that they have the resources they need. With regard to the Quality 
of Student Discussion in the survey, 68% of the responses were positive. This indicates further attention is needed in 
this area; particularly in explicit and targeted instruction and strategies on how to build on their ideas off of the ideas 
of their classmates.  

Additionally, the school-wide average for component 3b: Questioning and Discussion was 3.03 while the school-wide 
average for component 3c: Engaging Students in Learning had a school-wide average of 3.0, and component 3d: Using 
Assessment in Instruction was 2.99. Consequently, all three rated components in the domain of Instruction in the 
Danielson Framework received the lowest ratings during the 2017-2018 school year further revealing the need to 
strengthen teachers' pedagogy around rigorous instruction by focusing on data-based grouping, strengthening 
questioning and discussion techniques, and utilizing formative assessments to design learning tasks that are 
cognitively challenging and aligned to students' readiness levels. Domain 3d had a drop in rating from 3.06 in 2016-
2017 to 2.99 during the 2017-2018 school year. A contributing factor to this drop in ratings may be due to the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 

implementation of new curriculum teachers were unfamiliar with. The implementation of TCRWP writing curriculum 
pulled teachers away from simply writing about reading and required teachers to teach children how to write across 
multiple genres. While there was a robust professional development plan in place to support teachers with the 
implementation of this new curriculum, continued development in this area is needed; particularly in the area of 
formative assessment to drive targeted instruction. This data coupled with the data mentioned above regarding 
growth or lack thereof made with students with disabilities further supports the need to strengthen practices and 
targeted instruction and intervention for students currently performing in the bottom third. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, students in the bottom third across grades K-8 will demonstrate one-year's growth in reading and writing 
as measured by the TCRWP benchmarks through the development of targeted and personalized specially designed 
instruction, data-based groupings, formative assessments, and interventions.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 
development, and/or systems and structures needed 
to impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

 

Professional Development:  

TCRWP Calendar Days (Grades K-8): Teachers continue to attend 
calendar days to support their reading and writing curriculum 
and attend professional development sessions to focus on 
effective pedagogical strategies to facilitate the learning of 
reading and writing for specific genres. Participating teachers 
are expected to turnkey information from the calendar days 
with members of their team. Specific calendar days focusing on 
pedagogy and practice to support struggling students are:  

-Tackling the Hard Parts of Workshop Teaching - How to Handle 
Classroom Management, and to Create Pathways for Students to 
be Successful 

-Starting Off Strong: Launching Successful and Powerful Reading 
Workshops in Inclusive and Self-Contained Settings 3-8 

-Teaching the Essay: The TCRWP’s Latest Thinking on Helping 
Kids Write Essays with Voice and Power 

 

TCRWP In-house Coaching and lab sites: (K-8) teachers receive 
one-on-one coaching from TC consultants in the teaching of 
both reading and writing (10 sessions for teachers in grade K-5; 
7 sessions for teachers in grades 6-8) with a specific focus on 
using formative assessment to target student needs, build 
agency and Independence, and increase student achievement in 
reading and writing.

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
The school will support families in their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and Common Core by hosting a variety 
of parent-friendly workshops during parent-engagement sessions. Teachers will meet with families to share how the 
instructional shifts are shaping teaching and learning across the disciplines.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          19 

 

Additionally, teachers and parent coordinator will offer parent workshops in the evenings during PTA meetings. 
During these workshops parents will be afforded the opportunity to learn about best practices and resources that can 
support students at home. 

The 2017-2018 School Quality Guide survey in the area of “Strong Family-Community Ties” revealed that 91% of 
parents/guardians agreed or strongly agreed that they are invited to classrooms to observe instruction; an increase of 
20% from the 2016-2017 school year. In the 2018-2019 school year parents will continue to be provided with multiple 
opportunities to visit classrooms to observe instruction across the disciplines in grades PK-8 as well as partake in 
interest-based parent workshops that stem from visits in classrooms. 

 

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 

Part  4a.  Indicate  resources  you will  leverage  to  achieve  this  annual  goal  and  implement this  action  plan,  including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
We will use Strong Schools and Strong Communities funding (i.e. per diem funding to cover substitutes for teachers

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
As we continue to build on our understanding and knowledge of developing the whole child, it is becoming 
increasingly necessary to continue to deepen our focus on our students' social/emotional development.  

During the 2017-2018 school year we made great efforts to address the physical behaviors by working to build a 
community of respect, trust, and inclusiveness. We launched several initiatives to address this and cultivate a healthy 
environment focused on students' social emotional well being and social emotional learning. These initiatives are as 
follows: 

  became a "No Place For Hate school" 2017-2018 (2nd year in a row) 
  Continued our work as a Responsive Classroom school and provided professional development for the entire 

 

 

school at the beginning of the year and targeted PDs throughout the school year. 
instituted our core beliefs around the 4Es (Equity, Empathy, Excellence, Exploratory Learning) and embedded 
them into all learning experiences throughout the building. 
launched our HEROES awards assembly celebrating children for exemplifying our 4 Es through the following 
characteristics and behaviors (having HEART, being EMPATHETIC, showing RESPONSIBILITY in their work and 
in themselves, taking advantage of OPPORTUNITIES afforded to them and creating these opportunities for 
themselves, being EQUITABLE with their peers in the classroom as well as on the playground, and working 
toward achieving SUCCESS at all times (the first letter in each capitalized word spells out HEROES).  

  dismantled the Honors/Generals track in MS providing all students with equal opportunity to be on track for 
regents exams by the end of 8th grade. This also worked to dispel misconceptions and beliefs around student 
aptitude which contributed to the development of individual students' self-esteem. 

After an analysis of Online Occurrence Reports, social/emotional developmental needs of students continues to be an 
area in need of attention. The majority of our incidents were related to pushing, shoving, hitting, and minor physical 
altercations which took place mostly on days when teachers were out of the building for professional development 
and substitute teacher coverage was provided. While the level 3 incidents are still the majority of incidents reported, 
their has been a significant decrease in the percentage of these incidents. In 2017-2018 level 3 incidents accounted 
for 50% of the incidents reported; down by 11% from the 2016-2017 school year where they accounted for 61% of the 
incidents reported. 

While we have had positive impact on the school culture and community, we have identified this as an area that still 
needs attention. This is why we continue to fully implement the Responsive Classroom approach within our school. 
We have sent teachers for additional training at the Responsive Classroom Institute and have provided the full 
training to new teachers. We are continuing with our advisory program for middle school and revising our advisory 
curriculum to meet the needs of all students, and continuing the use of peer mediators and conflict resolution. 
Advisors for middle school need further training and development on restorative circles and restorative practices so 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          21 

 

they may be able to implement these strategies with our older students when dealing with difficult conversations and 
conflict.  

Additionally, teachers, staff, and students are engaging in conversations about how the 4 E's are reflected in the work 
being done at school, the experiences and interactions students are having, and the expectations set forth for each 
individual learner. Professional development around this area is being provided to school aides and paraprofessionals 
as they work with children during the lunch and recess periods which are the least structured parts of our day and 
times where social development is most prevalent. Deeper conversations and analysis about these 4 E's in our 
curriculum and our school culture is needed and voice from our parent population with regard to these 4 E's is also 
needed.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019 there will be a 5% decrease in OORs level 3 incidents (categorized by A34 & B36) as a result of the 
implementation of a universal plan of action that encourages a respectful, responsive, and inclusive school 
environment for all.

Establish a C6 as "Service Coordinator" to monitor how students 
are implementing the strategies unpacked in advisory during 
their service hours. 

Provide a full-time dean, full time counselor, part time social 
worker, psychologist and prevention counselor, so that students 
have someone they can speak to immediately regarding rising 
issues. These staff members are each trained in Responsive 
Classroom, LSCI and TCIS and will implement strategies in de-
escalate behaviors and minimize loss of instructional time.  

Train all staff on Responsive Classroom approach and their four 
domains that support and sustain student success effective 
management, developmentally responsive teaching, positive 
community, and engaging academics. 

 

Continue to build a common language and inclusive culture with 
the Responsive Classroom approach through the core practices:  

Interactive modeling 

  Morning Meeting 
  Teacher language 
 
  Academic choice

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

The school environment survey also revealed that 79% of the teachers agreed or strongly agreed that overall, their 
professional development experiences this year have been sustained and coherently focused, rather than short-term 
and unrelated. This is an increase from the 2016-2017 school year. With ongoing internal feedback systems on the 
quality of professional development, administrators will be able to continue to modify professional development 
workshops to ensure coherency and quality. 

According to the 2017-2018 school environment survey, 79% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that overall, their 
professional development experiences this year have included opportunities to work productively with colleagues in 
their school; a 21% increase from the 2016-2017 school year. In addition to improving the quality of professional 
development, changes to schedules in the 2017-2018 school year have made it possible to increase the opportunities 
for colleagues to collaborate. Teachers have common planning periods and common planning has been identified as a 
C6 option for teachers to select. 

Additionally, the school environment survey reflects a 79% positive response rate to questions regarding the quality 
of professional development. Targeted professional development on Responsive Classroom, TCRWP, math discourse, 
and specially designed instruction, and strategies to support ELLs have been identified by teachers and focus areas for 
professional development.

The number of students meeting the NYSELA standards in 2018 increased by 6%. With continued targeted 
professional development, coaching and increased common planning time, teachers will acquire the resources and 
skills to improve student outcomes. Intentional professional development will not only improve student outcomes but 
also teachers' perception on the quality of professional development they receive.  

Additionally, according to the School Environment Survey 68% of the students responded positively to the question, 
"Students say they are challenged in class." Various teaching methodologies could be strengthened, such as the use of 
scaffolds, the use of ongoing formative assessments to target individual needs, and the strategic planning for 
integration of content to facilitate transference of skills and knowledge and ultimately maximize student learning 
outcomes. With targeted professional development, coaching and increased common planning time, teachers will 
acquire the resources and skills to improve student outcomes. Intentional professional development will not only 
improve student outcomes but also teachers’ perception on the quality of professional development they receive.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019 teachers and students will engage in a minimum of three collaborative opportunities that enhance 
practices to promote best practices and foster a community of shared and spiraled learning progressions across grades 
as measured by a minimum of a .05 point increase in the school-wide average of component 3C-Engaging Students in 
Learning which was a 2.99 out of 4.0 by the end of the 2016-2017 school year.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

According to our overall ratings of MOTP for the 2017-2018 school year component 3D ( using Assessment in 
instruction) had the lowest rating average at 2.99. The administrative team underwent multiple calibration exercises 
to establish consistent evaluation and rating of teacher practice. Consistent evaluations surfaced a need to take a 
deeper look at how formative assessments can be used to further support the design of coherent instruction (1e) 
which decreased 0.05% from the 2016-2017 to the 2017-2018 school year.  

The school's Instructional Leadership Team (ILT) which consists of teachers and administrators worked collaboratively 
to develop a school-wide working definition of engagement which is as follows:  

"At 178, student learning is impacted by lifting the level of engagement socially, physically, and cognitively. 
Engagement is elevated when the instructional experiences provide students with opportunities to tackle real world 
problems, take appropriate risks, and explore activities at a deeper and more authentic level. The ultimate goal is to 
foster student agency through an environment that promotes effective collaboration, student ownership, and choice. 
When engagement is strengthened, productive struggle occurs and leads to a school community of citizens heading 
towards global and personal awareness." 

Teachers have been surveyed to identify desired areas of professional development based both on need and interest. 
Honing on strengthening teacher practice and teacher expertise will enable teachers to a.) think critically and plan 
strategically to increase student achievement, and b.) provide teachers opportunity to become experts in specific 
content and/or pedagogical practices which colleagues can support each other with.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of the teachers will participate in at least one intervisitation (in-house or with a partnering school) 
as well as participating in teacher-led professional development focusing on supports for students with disabilities as 
measured by a 5% increase in the section "Teacher Influence" under Effective School Leadership in the School 
Environment Survey.

Part 5 – Progress Monitoring  

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement

To analyze progress toward meeting the specified goal, a mid-point check in will occur in February 2019. At this time, 
we will monitor the effectiveness of the strategies implemented throughout the school that impact student 
ownership and agency. We will utilize Teacher Observation Report data to monitor the impact of such strategies 
through a 7% increase of the school-wide component average for 3c: Engaging Students in Learning in Advance. 

This data will also be used to make necessary adjustments to our school professional development plan as well as to 
determine targeted professional development for individual teachers and teacher sub groups.  

By February 2019, school-based student surveys will be administered at which point a 3% increase in positive 
responses in the area of "rigorous instruction" and "trust" as measured by the Framework for Great Schools will 
reflect adequate progress toward meeting the specified goal. 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. 
School-generated teacher/parent/student surveys (for the purposes of feedback on existing school-wide systems.)

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

On our 2017-2018 School Survey, reflected a 92% of positive responses around the category of Strong Family-
Community Ties within the Framework for Great Schools. In particular, 91% of families say that they get opportunities 
to visit their child's classroom, such as observing instruction or participating in an activity with their child. (Q1b) To 
improve in this area, we will continue "Family Fridays" where we will open the doors to all of our classrooms once a 
month to all of our families where they will be able to observe and interact with their children and the curriculum.  

A review of our 2017-2018 school-wide data reveals that 100% of teachers implemented Student-led Conferences 
(SLCs) in March 2018. Based on parent, staff and student feedback, SLCs have promoted student ownership of their 
learning. While 100% of the teachers implemented SLCs, we had a 90% family participation during this conference. 
There is a need to increase the number of parents engaging in these opportunities where students take ownerships 
and agency for their learning, reflect on their progress, and articulate their learning needs and successes.  

During the 2017-2018 Grade level teacher teams created newsletters and weekly homework sheets detailing what 
each grade would be working on in reading, writing, math, science, and social studies and includes important 
reminders and tips for families at home to support student progress. The Parent Coordinator provided a monthly 
update of upcoming events during PTA meetings and parent workshops. The Principal and Assistant Principal 
maintained the school’s Official Facebook Page, Twitter and Website to keep parents/guardians updated and the PTA 
distributed a bi-monthly parent newsletter. Parents have shared that workshops with guest speakers and those led by 
teachers are well-attended. The workshops have included topics such as fostering effective communication skills, anti-
bullying strategies, understanding the Common Core Learning Standards, and the importance of literacy. Parent 
surveys are used to discern workshop success. Parent volunteers have also been trained as Learning Leaders to assist 
in school activities.  

Many of these practices will continue during the 2018-2019 school year; however, as a school we have shifted from 
newsletters and forms being sent home to utilizing our school website, Facebook page, and twitter account to 
communicate with our families and engage them in the work being done at the school. As we continue to go 
paperless during the 2018-2019 school year, workshops and trainings for parents are in need so that they may be able 
to appropriately navigate the multiple resources available at the school. Some of these trainings and workshops are as 
follows: 

a.) navigating Skedula/IO classroom  

b.) understanding the High School application process,  

c.) accessing and navigating the school website,  

d.) outreach supports for families on special education and mental health,

Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, through an increased number of offerings each month (workshops, school community events, writing 
celebrations, Family Fridays, etc.) there will be an increase in parent involvement and parent engagement as measured 
by a 5% increase in the response to the following question on the School Environment Survey; "I am likely to attend a 
general school meeting or school event,"which is currently at 88%.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.

Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS/IS 178, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

PS/IS 178Q will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act. 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

After looking out our NYSESLAT scores, ELA State exam scores, and Math State exam scores 
it has been determined that our newcomer and long term ELLs are in need of additional supports 
in reading, writing, and math.  An after school program will take place in English once a week 
on Wednesday and Friday for two hours (2:20-4:20pm). Our ELL students who are in need of 
additional support in English Language Arts (ELA) in grades 3-8, as well as those who are in 
need of additional support in mathematics in grades 3-8 will be offered an after school program 
which will begin 1/14/19 and will end on 6/14/19. Two teachers  will teach two targeted groups 
of students (10 students per group), respectively (Grades 3-5 and Grades 6-8). Teachers will 
utilize materials from the Engage NY and NY Ready Curriculum, which are supplemental to our 
regular ELA and Math Curriculum. Teachers will use these resources to create their own lessons 
that specifically attend to the needs of the students based on their risk factors on the modalities of 
the NYSESLAT and other state exams. Furthermore, teachers will use the new language arts 
progressions to help guide their scaffolded instruction and lessons. Students will engage in 
project-based tasks to support their vocabulary and academic language acquisition. Teachers will 
use scaffolds to guide students in understanding the complex texts accessible through Engage 
NY and NY Ready. In math, students will engage in dissecting math problems by deconstructing 
text using NY Ready.  
Students will be provided with home language supports such as content area glossaries as well as 
bilingual dictionaries.  Student attendance and program notification in parents’ preferred 
languages will be maintained by the ENL teacher and the records will be maintained in the ENL 
office.  
An after school program will take place every week for two hours (2:20-4:20pm) for ELL 
students who are in need of additional support in ELA in grades kinder through two. The 
program begins on 2/4/19 and ends on 6/14/19. One teacher will teach one group of ten students.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Students are assessed four times throughout the school year. This information is uploaded into our school's Google drive, 
allowing all teachers, and service providers easy access to data and easy monitoring  student progress. This data helps to 
inform the school's instructional plan by helping us frame a common goal to support all English Language Learners during their 
language acquisition and helps them develop appropriate literacy skills. At PS/IS 178Q, the school leadership and the teachers 
are using assessment results to plan for individual and group assignments with varying levels of instructional work.  Teachers 
receive professional development on best practices to teach reading and writing with a Balanced Literacy Approach.  ENL 
Teachers implement balanced literacy, mirroring the work of the classroom teacher.  Classroom teachers work with ELL 
students in small groups to target next steps in reading comprehension through documenting writing conferences.  Our 
success is measured primarily by the benchmark reading level reached by students during their periodic assessment window as 
well as on-demand writing tasks.  This data proves that ELLs progress up to three reading levels by the end of the school year.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

At PS/IS 178Q, we evaluate the success of our program for ELLs by monitoring English language Proficiency with NYSITELL and 
NYSESLAT results through EDAT, English Language Arts, Math state exams, standardized tests, and any measures related to 
meeting state or local school reform goals.  Teachers compare results to prior years and assess whether they have met their 
proficiency goals.  Furthermore, teachers work together to develop professional learning goals in order to better support our 
ELLs.        
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
At PS/IS 178Q classroom teachers work with ELL students in small groups to target next steps. Teachers and students 
document goals and keep track of student achievements and next steps. Progress monitoring of each ELL student impacts 
instructional decisions that are made within each classroom and throughout the school.  Each classroom teacher is responsible 
for maintaining accurate records on the progress of each ELL.  Each classroom teacher provides detailed records to consider 
the ELL student's involvement in further RTI, If the data suggests that additional intervention is required to improve student 
progress.              
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

Tier II interventions are designed to provide supplemental, focused teaching and learning opportunities for a small group of 
students. These students are targeted as they are not responding to Tier I instruction and interventions. Students who receive 
Tier II interventions also continue to receive Tier I instruction and intervention.  The interventions are designed to address and 
strengthen students’ basic academic skills. Tier II interventions take place during Literacy instruction. Guided reading and small 
group strategy lessons are examples of our Tier 2 interventions. These interventions, provided in the classroom, enable 
teachers to target those students experiencing difficulty mastering a specific skill or concept.  These groupings are flexible and 
can be modified depending on the need.  The school uses various resources as Type II interventions for reading. Some 
resources included: Lower Grades: TCRWP assessments for progress monitoring, on-demand writing tasks, focus on fluency, 
sight word review, Fundations Wilson, Balanced Literacy/guided reading, small group strategy lessons, conference notes, 
student work samples, reading logs, books on tape, available technology such as Reading A to Z, and IPad II Apps. Upper 
Grades: Interim assessments for progress monitoring, TCRWP assessments, Fountas and Pinnell, comprehensive strategies 
through shared and guided reading, Wilson Program, Recipe for Reading, Great Leaps, Vocabulary: Words Their Way; small 
group strategy lessons, Grades 3- 8 group instruction for targeted students, conference notes, student work samples, reading 
logs, books on tape, available technology such as Reading A to Z, and IPad II Apps.   All “At-Risk” students receive high quality 
Tier II interventions. Interventions are provided by teachers and or service providers who: • Meet to develop an intervention 
plan that addresses the learning needs of each identified student in Tier II• Administer assessments to target proficiency 
levels. • Analyze student assessment data to monitor student progress and to determine the need for additional intervention 
or a change of intervention.  Tier III interventions provide more individualized, intense teaching and learning opportunities for 
students who are not achieving grade level expectations. More intensive interventions are achieved with a smaller student-
teacher ratio, a longer duration of instruction, detailed attention of individual learning with more frequent progress 
monitoring.  Students in Tier III instruction continue to receive core instruction. Tier III instruction occurs during the literacy 
block.     
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
PS/IS 178Q utilizes data from NYSESLAT, ELA state exams, Math State exams, TCRWP reading levels, mid and end of year 
assessment results. The data gathered helps teachers to plan for individual and group assignments with varying levels and 
instructional work.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Data from the 2017 NYSESLAT across all grades shows students' proficiency levels increased a level of proficiency or remained 
the same.   Data from the NYSESLAT also reveals that students score higher on the listening/speaking modalities than in 
reading/writing.  The patterns of proficiency across the four modalities affect instruction.  NYSESLAT analyses are used to tailor 
instruction and identify next steps.  All ELLs have access to coherent programs, as well as rigorous instruction in all subject 
areas.  This will allow each ELL to meet the high standards set for all students. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

As per CR Part 154.2 Freestanding ENL instruction is delivered as followed; integrated instruction is delivered by ENL teacher 
pushing into the classroom, collaborative team teaching is conducted, so that learning is maximized and opportunities to 
implement the core curriculum are presented, using a sheltered approach, students are provided access to mainstream, grade-
level content. A wide variety of instructional scaffolds are implemented into each program model.  Such as TPR, gestures, 
visuals, short videos, pre-teaching vocabulary, word banks, word walls, sentence frames and sentence starters, graphic 
organizers, teacher read aloud, shared reading, guided reading, choral reading, think, pair, share, jig-sawing, re-teaching, mini 
lessons and building background knowledge.  Native language support for content areas are implemented by the use of 
glossaries in home language, theme related reading in students home language, bilingual homework activities, pairing entering 
students with a bilingual partner, and teaching the use of cognates if native language allows.  These methods are aligned with 
Common Core Learning Standards by allowing students to be exposed to and focus on academic language and literacy.  With 
the use of native language supports students are capable of building onto and reinforcing skills in their native language, they 
will have the ability to transfer these skills into the new language. During integrated class instruction students are 
heterogeneously grouped. Integrated ENL instruction is delivered through four, forty-five minute periods a week, students are

grouped heterogeneously; entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding, and commanding. Standalone ENL instruction is 
delivered with ENL teacher using the Pull-out model; ELLs are brought together heterogeneously (entering, emerging students) 
for English acquisition focused instruction using the scaffolds above. Stand alone ENL instruction is delivered through four, 
forty-five minute periods a week. 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

N/A    

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A   

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

After analysis of RLER and RLAT reports, our ENL teacher creates a spreadsheet with every student entitled to ENL 
services; including students that are commanding. Next to each student, she documents their proficiency level along 
with their mandated number of instructional minutes. ENL teacher then creates an ENL schedule according to 
information on the spreadsheet. At PS/IS 178Q, our periods  are forty-five minutes long. Our ENL instructional 
minutes are delivered in the following model: entering and emerging students receive three hundred sixty minutes 
delivered through eight periods a week, students receive four periods a week of integrated ENL; transitional students 
and expanding students receive one hundred and eighty minutes through four periods a week of integrated ENL, for 
transitioning students two periods may be adjusted according to students' needs, commanding students receive 
ninety instructional minutes of integrated ENL, two periods a week. Integrated ENL is delivered via ENL push-in model 
with collaboration between classroom teacher and ENL teacher. All students receive ELA instruction through one 
ninety-minute block a day, five days a week.  ENL instructional minutes are confirmed by entry into STARS 
programming, which enables ENL teacher to ensure all students are receiving their mandated minutes.      

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

 The Common Core Curriculum is embedded in each of the four core content areas: English Language Arts, Mathematics, Social 
Studies and Science. The ENL teacher implements the common core standards and common core shifts through each program 
model via integrated or stand-alone ENL instruction. When the ENL teacher pushes into a classroom, collaborative team 
teaching is conducted, so that learning is maximized and opportunities to implement the core curriculum are presented, using 
a sheltered approach, students are provided access to mainstream, grade-level content. A wide variety of instructional 
scaffolds are implemented into each program model, such as Total Physical Response (TPR), gestures, visuals, short videos, 
pre-teaching vocabulary, word banks, word walls, sentence frames and sentence starters, graphic organizers, teacher read-
alouds, shared reading, guided reading, choral reading, think, pair, share, jig-sawing, re-teaching, mini lessons and building

bilingual partner, and teaching the use of cognates if native language allows.  These methods are aligned with Common Core 
Learning Standards by allowing students to be exposed to and focus on academic language and literacy.  With the use of native 
language supports students are capable of building onto and reinforcing skills in their native language, they will have the ability 
to transfer these skills into the new language.  The materials used in content subjects are Ready Gen, Go Math and Code X.    
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home language throughout the year by allowing them to use translated versions of 
science, social studies and math textbooks, upon availability.  Math assessments are available in Spanish.  Students have the 
opportunity to take these assessments in Spanish until the scaffold is no longer needed, this allows teachers to evaluate 
content comprehension in the home language.  Students in grades three and up receive a translated version of Math state 
exams, additionally with the use of word for word glossaries in Math and Science state exams. The use of glossaries allows us 
to evaluate how much students comprehend in their home language.    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

PS/IS 178 presently does not have SIFE students.  Our plan includes administering assessments to ensure proper placement, 
and an instructional plan of literacy and learning standards on par with the expectation of advancing these 
students.  Instruction would be tailored to learning styles based on educational strengths.  SIFE mandated ENL instructional 
minutes, RTI, small group support, differentiated instruction, extended day and after school instruction, contingent upon 
funding. SIFE students receive invitations to summer school.  Students who are newcomers are partnered with students who 
speak the same language.  For newcomers, the ENL Teacher uses: Total Physical Response (TPR); visuals; repetition; music; 
math manipulatives; graphic organizers; sound/word games; and role play, wingman. Developing students, receive an 
educational plan using differentiated instruction including graphic organizers, sentence prompts, sentence starters, peer 
tutoring, small group instruction and reading intervention will be implemented.  Long-term ELLs are closely monitored, review 
of past educational services will help to determine what further support these students need. An educational plan using 
differentiated instruction, peer mentoring, small group instruction and reading resources are implemented.  Former ELLs 
receive integrated ENL support for two years, ENL teacher ensures students are meeting grade level standards providing them 
with, scaffolding with the use of graphic organizers, writing prompts, feedback and self assessment. Former ELLs also receive 
testing accommodations ie. extended time and separate location.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 Instruction is aligned to ENL/ELA learning standards and embeds common core standards.  Instructional strategies teachers of 
ELL-SWDs use include:  visuals, realia, repetition, word walls, translated dictionaries and glossaries, bilingual texts and reading 
materials, music, math manipulatives, charts, graphic organizers, sound/word games, sentence frames, sentence starters, and 
role play.  Technology is also integrated into ELL-SWDs classrooms with the use of programs such as Brainpop, Reading A-
Z,  and  the use of IPADS. Other approaches are, embedding mini lessons, small groups, read alouds and guided reading,and re-
teaching material are part of their learning experience. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
The plan at PS/IS 178Q for an ELL identified as having special needs is to have him/her seen by teachers or service providers 
whom provide the necessary related service(s), such as, Speech and Language, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, 
Hearing and Vision Teacher, and SETSS.  Classroom teachers and the ENL teacher provide information on educational 
strategies to assist students to achieve the state-designated level of English proficiency for their grade.  The ENL teacher 
follows the Individualized Education Plan (IEP) of any ELL student with an IEP.  In addition, the use of STARS programming

allows teachers and service providers to create a schedule accordingly to ensure that overlapping does not occur and interfere 
within scheduling.     
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Teachers consistently assess students, formal and informally. Students are grouped heterogeneously based on their 
capabilities. Our interventions work by having students work in small groups based on student based data, work is 
differentiated based on their needs. Small groups allow teachers to target students with difficulty mastering a specific skill. 
These groups are flexible and teachers can modify as needed. Students also receive intervention support via integrated ENL 
and Math coach supports.  Our Freestanding ENL Program, with English only demonstrates that when minimal time away from 
the student's classroom is embedded, students master both content and language development quicker. The use of bilingual 
dictionaries and glossaries are encouraged during all content areas, ie. Math, Literacy, Science and Social Studies.  Support 
services for our ELLs in grades three and up include ELA and Math After School Programs offered from January through March 
that gives extra support in preparation for state-wide ELA and Math assessments. All students are encouraged to sign up for 
the after-school  Samuel Field "Y" Program in our school which offers students with homework assistance as well.     
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Based on data and trends, PS/IS 178Q is considering making improvements by purchasing new software programs for all 
learners. All teachers will have access to Reading A-Z in which teachers and parents can track and monitor student's reading. 
PS/IS 178Q is also implementing a new research skills class for our middle school class, in which students will be introduced to 
digital literacy using a program "Ignition". PS/IS 178Q is also considering working with Puppetry in Practice; with the use of 
puppetry and the arts it will help to promote better speaking, reading, listening and writing English Language comprehension.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

All ELL students are fully serviced and receive the mandated number of minutes per week.  Former ELL students receive testing 
accommodations for two years following their proficiency status on the NYESLAT.  They are also serviced by an AIS teacher for 
additional support.  ELLs and Former ELLs in the testing grades are invited and encouraged to attend the ELA and Math After 
School Program, which includes comprehensive preparation for the state-wide assessments (ELA and Math).  
  
PS/IS 178 implements the following enrichment and extracurricular activities for all students, including ELLs:  
•     CHAMPS After School Sports Programs – for Middle school students  
•     Talent Programs, including Drama, Digital Media and Visual Arts (Grades 6-8) 
•     Chorus (grades 3-8) - all ELLs invited to audition

available technology such as Reading A to Z, IPad II Apps. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
At PS/IS 178Q, we offer the Freestanding ENL program with home language supports through the use of glossaries/dictionaries 
in home language, theme-related reading in students home language, bilingual homework activities, pairing entering students 
with a bilingual partner in the same language if available, and with text materials in Math, Science and Social Studies in home 
language if available. use translated versions of science, social studies and math textbooks, upon availability. As stated above, 
Math assessments are available in Spanish. ENL teacher also teaches the use of cognates if native language allows. Our ENL 
teacher speaks Spanish and uses it as a scaffold with Spanish-speaking students,we also have pedagogues in the building that 
speak Russian, Greek, Italian, and Chinese, who can be accessed by classroom or ENL teacher in the event student needs home 
language support. With the use of native language supports, students are capable of building onto and reinforcing skills in their 
native language, they will have the ability to transfer these skills into the new language. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

PS/IS 178Q ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELL's ages and grade levels by placing students 
in the appropriate grade level according to their date of birth on birth certificate. Using a sheltered approach, students are 
provided access to mainstream, grade-level material and content. A wide variety of instructional scaffolds and differentiations 
are implemented into each program model, allowing content to be accessible to all students, including SWDs. ELLs receive ENL 
instruction via integrated ENL and/or standalone support by grouping students homogeneously by grade level.  This ensures 
students are being exposed to grade level material aligning to ENL and Common Core learning standards.  Instructional 
strategies for teachers of ELLs and ELL-SWDs use include:  visuals, realia, repetition, word walls, translated dictionaries and 
glossaries, bilingual texts and reading materials, music, math manipulatives, charts, graphic organizers, sound/word games, 
sentence frames, sentence starters, anchor charts and role play.  The use of technology also allows ELLs and ELL-SWDs to 
access grade appropriate supports. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

N/A  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
At PS/IS 178Q, we like to ensure our students and families feel welcomed into our school.  Students and families are welcomed 
by our office personnel and ENL teacher, they are carefully explained of class lists, school arrival and dismissal times, school 
calendar, school breakfast and lunch available to them. They answer any questions parents may have. ENL teacher gives 
elementary school student a tour of our school to allow student to acclimate to his/her environment. Our schools guidance 
counselor is in charge of welcoming any middle school children and providing them with a tour.  During parent orientations, 
parent coordinator greets new parents, and makes them aware of parent workshops and supports available to them within 
our school or school district.  Once students are in the classroom, newcomers are partnered with students who speak the same 
language; if available, this will be their "wingman" until the scaffold is no longer needed. ENL teacher also makes special visits 
to classroom to ensure student is adjusting well to their new environment.  Classroom teachers are also encouraged to use an 
icebreakers to introduce students with newcomers throughout the school year, allowing opportunity to make him/her feel 
welcomed and easy.

teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
PS/IS 178Q offers parent workshops led by ENL teacher to provide information to parents regarding program goals. ENL 
teacher also conducts conferences/ meetings with parents during parent and teacher engagement time every Tuesday through 
out the school year.  If translation is needed we use in-house, parents, or over the phone interpretation service.  All parents 
must sign into a sign-in log, all logs are kept and handed to our parent coordinator who retains them for records.  ENL teacher 
keeps a log of all in person meetings, phone calls and letters sent to parents.   
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
PS/IS 178 recognizes the importance of parent, family and community involvement in the education of English Language 
Learners.  At “Meet the Teacher Night,” ELL parents are informed about state standards, assessments, school and class 
expectations and program requirements for the freestanding ENL program.  An ELL Parent Orientation is conducted for parents 
of new incoming ELLs soon after NYSITELL testing of eligible students.  Parents view a video in their own language, if available, 
before making an informed program selection.  Classroom and ENL teacher meet with parents at parent teacher conferences 
and throughout the school year.   Parent workshops are led throughout the school year, some topics included, are "Building 
upon my child's academic success", "How to help your English Language Learner". Parents are also encouraged to be active 
members of our schools PTA as well as partaking in our annual multicultural fair, "coffee with the principal" and classroom 
celebrations.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, The Holliswood School, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community are Part III of Home 
Language Information Survey (HLIS), blue data cards, emergency contact cards, ATS Otele Reports, parent surveys, 
teacher surveys, input from the ENL teacher, classroom teachers, counselors, PTA, and the parent coordinator.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

to modify any services parents may need. We also gather notes and feedback from parents throughout the school 
year through our parent workshops, exit slips,.
