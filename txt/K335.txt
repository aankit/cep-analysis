Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Granville T. Woods Community Learning School 335 is the dynamic community hub that provides innovative services 
to children parents, educators, and the Bedford Stuyvesant/Crown Heights Community at large. Our goal is to provide 
academic, social, emotional and mental health services to meet the holistic needs of students, staff, and families in 
order to strengthen the entire community. We want to remove all barriers to learning by providing a village of 
support to strengthen students’ academic achievement and well-being . 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

At Granville T. Woods Community Learning School 335, we believe all students deserve a comprehensive education 
where their needs are met. Through the application of a common core aligned curriculum, students will develop 
critical thinking skills that deepen their knowledge and prepare them for the workplace of the 21 st Century.  

We have realized that there is strength when there is a partnership of individuals and groups who have a common  

vision, a shared set of values, and a uniting force. It has become abundantly clear to our organization that we need 
the community stakeholders to see how we can work together to bring the support structures needed by our 
students and families. The obstacles our students face on their path to achieving academic success are numerous 
both in and out of the classroom. In addition to the need for targeted supports aimed to reduce chronic absenteeism 
and improve educational outcomes, many students have unmet needs in critical service areas including health care 
and mental health. Understanding that students learn best when their physical, mental, emotional and other needs 
are met, Granville T. Woods Community Learning School 335 is deeply committed to the community school strategy 
as our model for increasing school connectedness , improving student attendance, and reducing chronic absenteeism. 
Through partnerships that connect our school staff, our students, their parents and community organizations, we 
work together to remove all obstacles to learning and to create a supportive learning environment for the whole 
school community. We do this by providing academic programs and a full range of child and family services, all 
offered within the school building . We need to make sure that our students and families have the access to the 
resources to keep them healthy, socially and emotionally sound, and fosters academic growth. 

 

In 2013, Granville T. Woods Public School 335 became Granville T. Woods Community Learning School 335. In 
addition, we received the Attendance Improvement Dropout Prevention (AIDP) grant from the New York City 
Department of Education, for four years to support the reduction of chronic absenteeism. 

Our goal as a school community has been to promote, enact and support a school model based on the premise that 
school is central to the lives of the community members. We see school as place where students and families can 
have access to resources for the support and development of student success. These resources are made available 
within the school or outside the school and include services that address physical, social, emotional, recreational and 
academic needs. We see families as partners in their child’s education. We also see it as our responsibility to provide 
the tools needed by community members to provide services, trainings and workshops that would best support 
families in their role as caregiver and school partner. We have allocated an extensive amount of time and resources 
around this concept and we have seen dramatic improvements in many areas in our school. These include improved 
academic indicators, a reduction in incidents and suspensions and a reduction in the level of students who are 
chronically absent. 
 
Counseling in Schools support us with our focus on mental health and chronically absent students. Our counselors 
offers targeted students individual and group counseling sessions as well as academic support. Family counseling is 
also offered. We also have a counselor that specializes in Art Therapy. Outreach via phone calls, letters is also 
provided to the families of targeted students. Parent Forum, as well as monthly meetings are held throughout the 
school year to share the many resources available to families and to hear their voices and concerns of our 
constituents on how to make our school community better. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Recognizing that “one size does not fit all,” our philosophy and culture support Common Core aligned curriculum that 
is challenging and based on the individual learner. As each student has his or her unique strengths and challenges, our 
teachers strive to teach in a variety of ways to tap into those strengths and address those challenges. We aim to 
provide each child with the opportunity to participate in a balanced literacy approach to reading and writing (in 
collaboration with Columbia University's Teachers College Reading and Writing Project), and an inquiry-based 
approach to science and math. We strongly believe in instruction that is assessment-driven and requires children to 
be actively engaged in their own education.  

As an arts-infused school, we currently work in collaboration with many NYC cultural organizations including, Disney 
in Schools, Ballet Tech. In addition, our social studies, math and science curriculum are enhanced through 
collaborations with Chess In Schools, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC),Food Bank for New York City. In addition to 
these collaborations we currently have full time, certified teachers of art, dance, theater, and computer science. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Students with Disabilities-SWD especially our students in self contained classes, and our ELL's must be provided with 
multiple entry points and targeted scaffolds to support their academic growth.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

We made the most progress in providing a supportive environment for members of our school community. Our focus 
for next school year will revolve around rigorous instruction and monitoring systems.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Our school has implemented several shifts in structure and pedagogy over the last few years that have changed the 
way we teach and students learn. This begins with ensuring administrators prioritize their role as instructional leaders 
and provide the necessary professional learning opportunities to ensure all teachers are supported and use data for 
instructional planning. We have embarked upon a continuous journey of improvement centered on increasing college 
and career opportunities for our students and creating a culture of achievement.  

Our fundamental belief is that student engagement is the key to student success. The administrators and teachers 
have collaboratively focused on increasing student engagement in every classroom. Engagement and assessment in 
daily lessons through questioning and discussion is present. Common Core Learning Standards and the Instructional 
shifts are being integrated into units and lessons, raising the level of rigor in every content area. 

Our school is determined to provide programs above and beyond the traditional requirements. Our students all have 
access to Disney Kids, iReady, Front Row, Discovery Education, and Brain Pop. As a Community Learning School, we 
offer After School Programs in academics, arts, and sports related.. We also offer student "Club" once a week on 
various student interests. (Yoga/Conservation, Debate, Chess, PowerPlay, etc). We believe it is important to do more 
for students with what resources we have. At Granville T. Woods Community Learning School 335, we fully implement 
the Danielson Framework for Teaching (DFT) in accordance with the NYC Department of Education (NYCDOE) 
guidelines. 

The Danielson model has afforded us the means to deliver frequent targeted feedback and effect positive change in 
instructional practice. Lessons have incorporated the Common Core shifts, and Learning Standards, and multiple entry 
points in class discussions, questions and answers. Instruction is more engaging with the use of class activities and 
opportunities for application of skill/knowledge. The school has successfully implemented the Danielson Framework 
for Teaching to improve teacher practices through frequent observations, post observation conferences and 
feedback. 

Needs of our school have been identified as follows : 

Students with special needs are receiving varied services depending upon need and academic strengths; however, we 
still need to improve in their academic performance in ELA and Mathematics. Our teachers are engaging in continuous 
formative classroom assessment but it continues to be an area of development with our special needs and ELL’s 
population. Observations show administrators that teachers are continually improving in these areas and are building 
capacity for more targeted differentiation.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

Teachers, Teachers’ College Staff Developers, and UFT Teacher Specialists have aligned lessons and units to the 
common core and NYS standards. In addition, teachers constantly review their lessons to address data driven best 
practices and ensure they are present during instruction. Questioning and discussion has been revised and improved 
to include evidence based prompts, scaffolding and multiple entry points, higher order thinking questions and whole 
class responses to check for understanding. The assessments and objectives are aligned to the common core and New 
York State content standards. 

 

Teachers encourage student to student interaction, goal setting and reflection in order to track progress toward 
objectives and standards in their classes. Teacher teams review progress and challenges with the implementation of 
their units and lessons on a regular basis. Assessments are directly aligned to the curriculum and the standards so that 
students are aware of what is expected of them in every content area. Pre, post and summative assessments are used 
across all grades and subject areas so that there is consistency and standards based instruction and alignment. In 
addition, teachers work with students to develop personal student goals and plan next steps for success. Some 
teachers utilize a portfolio method of student work and assessments so that students can review, add and revise their 
work, and track their progress.  

Teachers incorporate student goals to engage students in their own learning. In addition, teachers will have students 
revise and correct their own work, or have student pairs review each others work so that reflection becomes part of 
the class routine. Teachers have pre and post assessments and utilize these assessments to inform their instruction. 
Teachers then utilize the data from assessments to plan and differentiate instruction. Teachers review student work 
and performance on assessments offering ongoing feedback for improvement and next steps.  

Teachers then adapt and/or modify lesson plans to address student needs and strengths. With a focus on student 
engagement, various activities are planned, purposeful grouping is implemented and student choice is enacted. Areas 
of focus for this school year: Teachers utilizing instructional practices and strategies that are organized around annual, 
unit and daily lesson plans to meet established student goals and promote high levels of student engagement and 
inquiry. Teachers providing coherent, appropriately aligned Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS) based 
instruction that leads to multiple points of access for all students to achieve targeted goals. 

School Challenges : 

Teachers have integrated instructional strategies into their daily lessons to increase student engagement. Teachers 
have participated in professional development sessions on utilizing CCLS, to increase rigor for all students.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

As evidenced by Quality Review Data (2018) and School Quality Snapshot 2016-2017, one of our school's strengths is 
"Teacher Collaboration."In our school, teachers have been promoting and supporting a greater level of collaboration 
and collegiality thereby creating more consistency and continuity of instructional practices between classes and 
grades. Instructional practices that are being aligned to the Common Core Learning Standard (CCLS).  

Teacher collaboration will support the priority need, "Rigorous Instruction", that will positively impact student 
achievement. 

Students’ academic needs are addressed and measured by formative and summative data. 

Lesson plans need to be aligned to student data. Throughout our school, we need to improve the level of questioning 
during instruction. 

Co-teaching on the ICT classes needs to improve and demonstrate more purposeful planning. Students need to be 
more actively engaged in discussions during instructional time. Students need more opportunities to share their 
perspectives. Using more critical thinking activities during classroom instruction. The learning environment needs to 
continually reflect the needs of the diverse learners. 

Data needs to be used as a tool to provide students with access to learning that meets the learner where they are. 
Assessment tools such as item analysis, benchmark tests, running records, pre and post On Demand writing samples 
can. be used to support daily lessons as evidenced by planning that supports diversity of learner, increase in academic 
rigor in questioning and ongoing monitoring of student work needs to be consistent. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, all teachers will participate in professional learning communities and inquiry work focused on Danielsons 
Framework 3c (Engaging students in learning) in order to meet the needs of diverse learners within their classrooms 
resulting in an Advance 3C increase.

Our school leadership needs to ensure that the mission statement and academic goals for the school are understood 
and clearly articulated by all stakeholders. Instructional practices need to be more consistently monitored, as 
evidenced by more students being challenged or given more opportunities to develop the necessary skills to become 
college and career ready. 

Our school leadership needs to continue to support and ensure that the school community shares the SMART 
goals/mission, and long term vision and priorities established in the CEP. The mission and goals of the school need to 
be prominently visible throughout the school and clearly articulated by all stakeholders. 

● The classrooms need to reflect a data driven approach to teaching and learning.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Based on the 2017-2017 School Quality Snapshot Data, 94% of teachers responded to questions about Strong Family 
Ties. Within this Framework, 100% of teachers say that the school works well with families. Priority needs within this 
framework one of the needs is to communicate with parents on ways that they can support their child at home. 

Our school engages in regular communication with students and families that encourages and promotes high 
expectations for academic growth. Our relationships with community partners, particularly our new Community 
School designation with UFT Community Learning School, will continue to foster our strengthening relationship with 
the community’s stakeholders. The more informed parents are, the more encouraged they are to become active 
members in support of the school’s goals and mission. Reciprocal communication has helped the school community 
to foster a strong relationship with parents. It is evident that the open and mutually respectful partnership between 
home and school enables families to support their child’s development. There are partnerships between the school 
and community agencies promoting social and emotional developmental health to support student success. Our 
community partnerships are strengthening a relationship where students are nurtured, respected, recognized for 
their talents and supported as they address weaknesses. Professional development helps staff to establish and sustain 
productive relationships and partnerships with parents, who help our staff, acquire a more comprehensive 
understanding of each child.

Directions: 
-  All Title I schools must complete Part A of this section. 
-  All Non-Title I schools must complete Part B of this section. 
 
Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website:

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
Communication between preschool and elementary school program staff is important not only in developing a shared 
sense of ideas about the preparation of preschoolers for elementary school, but also in providing information for the 
receiving program teachers about the social/emotional development and learning styles of the children who will be 
entering their programs. The following are some communication strategies you might want to use: 

  Participation in cross program visitation. Preschool teachers visit the elementary programs in the fall while 

the elementary school teachers may visit the preschool programs in the spring. This time can be used for 
observation and interaction with children, with additional time at the end of the day for teachers to exchange 
information.  

  Collaborative planning time for Elementary and Pre-school Teachers. 
  Parent workshops to support parent education in providing social/emotional support to their child. 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
MOSL Team, Grade level teams, curriculum team, and professional development team use multiple sources to  

demonstrate the ability to understand and analyze data to inform instructional practices. These groups use data to 
identify student learning trends, set goals, modify and monitor instruction, and increase student achievement. The 
Instructional Team members gets feedback from their colleagues on their grades and bring information to the Team 
to help in school-wide decision making on various assessments. 

Teacher teams use protocols to identify strengths and learning gaps. This process helps teachers to identify student 
learning gaps.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Granville T. Woods Community Learning School 335, in compliance with the 
Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a 
parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and 
the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and 
decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the 
School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed 
members of the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Granville T. Woods Community Learning School 335 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;

outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before October 30th of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

Addendum: Community School Partnerships 

Directions: The Community School (CS) strategy is directly aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. Community 
Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and 
family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in 
Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & 
Wellness. 
 
Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s) 

How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student 
academic outcomes?  
We have continued to extend rigorous instruction throughout the school day. With AIDP funding we 

are able to reach some of our most vulnerable students by providing afterschool enrichment and 

academic support. Student outcomes have been affected by an increase in statewide test scores. We 

have also seen positive social-emotional outcomes as a result of the increase in school time. 

 
Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to 
be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
This year’s SMART goal will be focused on providing additional enrichment opportunities for students 

during Out of School Time. 

 

By June 2018, we will provide two or more additional program cycles into our current after-school scheduling to 
include Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (S.T.E.A.M.) activities.  

 

 

Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s): 
How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family 
Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students? 
Our goals in the categories of ELT, attendance, increased family engagement and health and wellness will be reflected 
in the programs and services we provide this year. CLS 335 will be continuing most of the initiatives surrounding 
health wellness, academic support and attendance support which were proven to be effective previously. An on-going 
partnership with Counseling In Schools will ensure that we will be able to build capacity with parents, students and 
outside community with regard to overall health and wellness. Our school staff will also collaborate to form 
committees that are tailored to address specific gaps in service within our school community. We believe these 
initiatives will further prepare students for academic success by minimizing barriers which affect students' ability to 
attend school on a regular basis. 

 

 
Part 2 – Community School Partnerships Core Services Action Plan 

Part 2a. Identify the Community-based Organization (CBO) partnerships that you will develop in ELT, Attendance 
Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & Wellness, their target student population(s), and scope of the services 
provided. As well as supporting schools’ supportive environment and attendance work, CBOs should be helping to 
support your school’s instructional focus.

Part 3c. Describe how the school will partner with the Lead CBO to do the following: 
1. 

Community Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and 
together with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will 
lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating 
activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work. 
Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and 
services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time 
(ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the 
right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly 
coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day. 
Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to 
strengthen this initiative. 
Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and 
families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of 
their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community 
School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement 
strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use. 
Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.

4. 

The CSD will continue on-going informal needs assessments as well as add more formal short surveys throughout the 
school year to ensure community stakeholder input. We will continue to use data sourced from the Data Sorter 
provided via the Office of Community Schools. Student programs will be assessed on a quarterly basis to ensure each 
program is meeting its target population’s goals. Academic data provided by the School’s Administration will also be 
used to implement and support program needs. School staff including the SBST Team and Guidance will support 
mental health programming. The CSD and Parent Coordinator (PC) will continue their partnership to ensure parents 
are aware of services and programs available to each family. There will also be an increased focus placed on 
communication within the school’s staff to ensure messaging is consistent to parents. There will be monthly 
opportunities for parents to meet with the CSD and PC to discuss the Community Schools Strategy. Weekly meetings 
will be scheduled as well as impromptu “check-ins” throughout the week.

1- CLS 335 wishes to continue building on the strong ties within the community in which we 

serve. We will deepen our partnership with our Summer Camp subcontractor by expanding 

our afterschool programming to include a music curriculum. We also plan to continue our 

work with Counseling In Schools (MH support). Key staff members have developed and 

researched additional resources that can be used for student, staff and parental support 

through the use of a S.T.E.A.M lab. The CSD will continue to pursue 

funding which builds capacity for the programs mentioned. Goals for this year also include 

expanding programs and services across several needs gaps and working with current 

partners to better integrate existing programs and services. 

2- Our current Community School Team members include our Principal, Parent Coordinator, 

representatives of our teaching staff, representatives of our paraprofessional staff, parents 

and a valued community partner. Meetings are held monthly during the school year. 

3- Use of statewide test results, MOSL and other academic assessments will provide information 

regarding student growth and achievement. We will use previously established meetings such 

as the Attendance Team(Student Success Committee) meeting to further develop and track 

the success of interventions implemented for each student. The Data Sorter will also inform 

our strategic implementation of interventions where needed. 

 
Part 4b. Indicate resources needed including human resources, instructional resources, and schedule adjustments to

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The assessment tools that we use to assess early literacy skills in our ELLs are TCRWP and teacher created assessments. The 
results from theses are very important to us because they provide insight for each student. It provides knowledge about the 
students’ acquisition of English in various categories and their strengths and challenges. This data is useful for the ESL provider 
to keep informed by these periodic assessments which are broken down and easy to inform lesson plans.  This data will be 
used to inform planning, instruction and goals for each student. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

The ESL teacher collects NYSESLAT data on the ELLs, studies the data  by analyzing the yearly progress of each student and 
determines which areas show growth and which areas stay stagnant. The growth is indicative of the success of our program.    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
If a students is in need of RTI, our school has created a team of teachers that collect data, student work, assesments and 
comes up with a collborative plan with detailed steps and strategies for targeted areas that are monitored for student progress 
withinh a specific time period.  English Language development is provided at Tier 1,2 and 3. At Tier1 we provide rigorous and 
evidence based instruction including language development. At Tier 2, extra attention, activities and experience targeted to 
specific students in addtion to core instruction. Tier 3, we provide intensive and individualized instruction in a small group or 
one to one if needed.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The NYSESLAT data shows that ELLs are making incremental gains on the assessment by moving to the next proficiency level to 
become language proficient.  ELLs who are in the Entering and Emerging level are mostly new comers or students with 
disabilities.   
  
After reviewing the NYSESLAT data, the patterns revealed were:  
•               Speaking is in line with general abilities for the majority of the Entering, Emerging, Transitioning and Expanding 
students.  It is the Listening, Reading and Writing skills that are holding our students back from the Commanding level. This is 
the case especially in the Entering and Emerging level ELLs.  
•               After looking at the NYSESLAT scores by modalities, it was prevalent that the Writing scores are causing the 
Expanding students to remain on the advanced level. 
  
The NYSESLAT information will assist instructional decisions, because it provides the ESL provider with the breakdown of each 
modality and each student’s strength and challenging area.  Therefore the ESL provider is able to create effective lessons that 
target these challenging areas. 
The NYSITELL data reveals the strengths and difficulties some students encounter in modalities such as Reading and Writing in 
their new language which hinder them from scoring Commanding on the entrance exam. 
    
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Standalone ENL is implemented as per CR Part 154.2 in two different ways. Students are gropued heterogenously or 
mixed proficieny level as well as grouped homogeously or the same proficiency level in one class. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

                              Students will get 1-2 units of study per week of instructional time in ENL/ELA depending on their level 
according to Part 154-2. If the are Entering they will receive 2 units of study in ENL and one Integrated ENL. If They are 
Emerging, they will receive .5 unit of study in ENL, 1 unit in ENL/ELA and .5 unit in Content Area. If they are Transitioning, they 
will receive .5 unit in ENL/ELA and .5 unit in Content Area. If they are Expanding, they will receive I unit in ENL/ELA or Content 
Area. If they are Commanding, they will rceive .5 unit in Integrated ENL in ELA. Entering students will receive 360 minutes, 180 
minutes of standalone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL. Emerging students will receive 360 minutes , 90 minutes of 
standalone ENL, 180 of integrated ENL and 90 of flexibilty programming. Transitioning students will receive 90 minutes of 
integrated ENL and 90 minutes of flexibility programming. Expanding students will receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL. 
Commanding students will receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
                Content is delivered through the use of scaffolding the content to make it comprehensible. Vocabulary is tageted 
through the intoduction of pre fixes, suffixes, root words, multiple meanings, synonyms  etc. Graphic organizers are used as 
visual scaffolds. Pictures, technology and audio devices are used as an entry point and as a scaffold as well.  Specially Designed 
Academic Academic Instruction for ELLS such as Metacognitive Development, Bridging, Schema-Building, Contextualization, 
Teaxt-Representation and Modeling are some of the strategies used to instruct our ELLs. Bi-lingual dictionaries are avilable for 
those who are literate in their first language. Think alouds, think-pair-share, teacher demonstrations and student 
demonstartions are all used to make content comprehensible. Students are provided printed academic bi-lingual glossaries in 
the content areas (Math, Science, Social-Studies) and introduced to cognates in order to provide native language support in 
the content areas. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

                Students are offered MOSLs and Baselin Assessments in their home language if they are available.       
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 VI.               Plan for Newcomers 
  
In this school we have eleven newcomers. When a new student is registered in our school, we provide the following resources 
to facilitate the transition.  
  
•               An informal student orientation 
•               Buddy system identifying a similar student in his/her class that will assist during the day 
•               Encourage student and their parent to participate in all of our Supplementary Programs and After School activities. 
•               An informal assessment is provided to identify appropriate Academic Intervention Services.  
•               Home school communication. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

  
VII.               Plan for SIFE 
  
In this school we have no SIFE student. In the furture, if we do we will provide the following resources to facilitate the student. 
  
•               Making an individualized student needs assessment 
•               Creation of an AIS plan for the student focus on the literacy and math component 
•               Grade appropriate instructional support materials 
•               Differentiation of instruction in all areas 
•               Staff will receive professional development in the new ALLA assessment to identify SIFE students; and in strategies 
that benefit the SIFE within your classroom instruction. 
  
  
VIII.               Plan for Long Term ELLs 
  
In our school we have no long term ELLs, but in the future if we do we have an action plan for them. Our action plan for the 
student/s involves: 
•               An after school program, targeting reading and writing four days during the week.  
•               Monitoring the progress of students in all content areas to differentiate instruction for literacy needs 
•               Encourage their participation in all supplementary programs to enrich their language and academic skills  
  
IX.               Plan for Special Needs Students 
  
We have two special needs students. Our policy for special needs students includes: 
•               Ensure that teachers of students with an IEP are familiar with students’ particular needs and all services are provided 
accordingly to the IEP mandates. 
•               Collaboration between the ESL teacher and IEP contact person. 
•               Monitoring newcomer and SIFE student for possible special needs status. 
•               The delivery of AIS services during school 
The ESL teacher uses the Instructional Educational Plan as an important tool to plan and provide access to academic content 
areas and accelerate English language development.  Each IEP is carfefully reviewed and analyzed for effictive planning. In 
addition, the ESL teacher speaks and collaborates with the classromm teacher to ensure that instructional strategies and 
grade-level materials are used. 
  
X. We have four Former ELLs. For Former ELLs, we plan to: 
       continue providng academic support and be monitiored on a weekly basis. Students will still be provided with the 
mandated testing accomadations like the othe ELLs. Also students will receive their mandated minutes to support their 
academic success.           
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers emphaasize explicitly teaching forms of English e.g., vocabulary, syntax, morphology, functions, and conventions. 
They emphasize academic language as well as conversational language. Instruction incorporates reading and writing and does 
emphasize listening and speaking. Instruction integrates meaning and communication to support explicit teaching of language. 
Instruction is planned and delivered with specific language objectives in mind. The use of the home language is strategically 
used in instruction when necessary. Instruction in classes includes interactive activities among students and are carefully 
planned and carried out. Instruction provides students with corrective feedback on form.  Instruction is differentiated and 
scaffolded with various supports (visual, tactile, audio) to provide ELL-SWD the same access to a rigorous curriculum.         
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

Each IEP is carefully reviewed and analyzed for effective planning. In addition, the ESL teacher speaks and collaborates with the 
classromm teachers to ensure that instructional strategies and grade-level materials are used.The ESL teacher meets with 
teachers to co-plan IEP goals of the students. Together the teachers use the curriculum, instructional strategies and schedule 
for each student in order for them to both support the ELLs to attain proficiency within the least restrictive environment.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Here at P.S. 335, we offer Saturday school, small group differentiated instruction, Fundations, and I-Ready. 
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

For the upcoming school year we would like to consider purchasing the Rosetta Stone program for our newcomer ELLs. This 
language acquisition program is a good program for students to practice everyday English conversations. It strengthens their 
language proficiency and literacy skills.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

No programs or services will be discontinued.   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are informed and encouraged to be participate in our after school program. The program is designed to assist students 
with projects and home work help and academics.    
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
ELLs have access to the activites we provided are all requested in the school community and therefore the parents are 
involved.  The most updated, modern computers in our school. All teachers are equipped with and constantly use smart 
boards for instruction to support ELLs and all students. The teachers all incoporate realia, picture cards and manipulatives in 
their lessons to supports ELLs. Bi-lingual glossries, dictionaries and books are all available in the students native language for 
support.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

The primary language is limited but used strategically in instruction to ensure that students understand task directions, pay 
attention to cognates, and master language learning and metacognitive strategies.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

  
Students are mixed by proficiency levels as well as by grades.  Students are allowed by the staff to leave their classes and go to 
the ESL classroom, according to their scheduled time in order to receive their mandated minutes.  In ESL, the content area 
subjects are delivered by the use of content area vocabulary and scaffolding techniques.  The ESL provider frequently 
articulates with the teachers and plans lessons that support difficult vocabulary and concepts. The provider also shares these 
strategies with the content area teachers for them to use. These methodologies and techniques help the ELL student develop 
their Basic Interpersonal Cognitive Skills (BICS) in the beginning and their Cognitive Academic Language Skills (CALPS) later on, 
to meet the language needs of the English Language Learners. Students are allowed to use their native language with the 
teacher and/or peers to express understanding or as for clarification. Books in the different native languages are available to 
support instruction as well as for students to take home.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
ELLs have access to the activites we provided are all requested in the school community and therefore the parents are 
involved.  The most updated, modern computers in our school. All teachers are equipped with and constantly use smart 
boards for instruction to support ELLs and all students. The teachers all incoporate realia, picture cards and manipulatives in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

 

their lessons to supports ELLs. Bi-lingual glossries, dictionaries and books are all available in the students native language for 
support.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Our school will begin an orientation before the beginning of the school year for newly enrolled ELLs and their families. We will

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Our school intends to consult the calendar of PD dates for the current year and send our ESL teacher as well as ELL personnel 
to all PD and workshops given by the Department of ELLs as well as by the state.  This will include the assistant principal, the 
common branch tecahers, the paraprofessionals. We will aslo look into in-house PD if possible.   
Our ELL Teacher is quite proactive and regularly attends any PDs given by the Office of ELLs during the school year. The PDs will 
support teachers of ELLs because they will have knowledge about research based strategies, activities,  that support the 
Common Core and are aligned with instruction for ELL academic success.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Our school will consult the calendar of PD for the guidance counselor to attend, to support the best practices while working 
with ELL families  in order to offer advice, guidance and resources in their Home Language when choosing middle schools that 
best suite their needs.  
Our school will send teachers to workshops dedicated to language acquisition including the best practices for integrated 
language and content instruction for ELLs. Copies of agendas and attendance are kept and filed/stored. The originals are kept 
by the principal.

services. She will discuss goals for the program, language proficiency assessment results and language development needs in 
all content areas.

including the Holiday Luncheon, Family Day, the Annual Parent Fair, and the Pan American Day Festival. At these events, the 
school and community can come together to recognize student achievements in arts and academics.  
•               Translation and Interpretation Services: These services are offered to increase the involvement of parents in the ESL 
program, additional funding is available to translate important policy documents, in any possible language. Additionally, 
interpretation services are a daily help in communication between school staff and parents.

•               Cornell Medical Group Workshop: This work shop is to keep parents well informed about their nutrition and the 
benefits of maintaining a health diet and health lifestyle.

relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility

Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting.

choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
