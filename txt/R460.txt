Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

The mission of Susan E. Wagner High School is to develop reflective, empowered learners - both students and adults - 
who take responsibility for their learning. We will shape a 21st Century global society by inspiring stakeholders to 
value education, equity, excellence, and empathy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

As a large comprehensive high school, Susan E. Wagner High School is able to offer its students with a wide range of 
required and elective courses, as well as extracurricular team and club activities. Within this setting, all students 
belong to one of fifteen learning centers designed to pique student interest and improve academic performance. Each 
learning center serves as a small learning community with an exclusively assigned teacher-coordinator, guidance 
counselor and assistant principal. In the most recent School Quality Snapshot our school was celebrated in the area of 
Rigorous Instruction. 

Additionally, the school prides itself in its latest initiative, The University at Susan E. Wagner . Our University Program 
offers eligible students the opportunity to take many of our 22 courses, which total 66 credits of college credits (and 
this list grows each year). Wagner is proud to have partnered with St. John's University, Kings borough Community 
College, The College of Staten Island, and Wagner College to provide students with college credited classes. Our 
college level coursework includes: Advanced Placement, College Now, College and University Partnerships. 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The special student populations that we continue to focus on is our Students with Disabilities. Students with 
disabilities have multiple needs including self regulation of behavior and academic support. We implement positive 
behavior intervention systems, staff training on implementing the behavior intervention plans, and frequent school 
intervention team meetings. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

During the 2017-2018 school year, Susan Wagner High School went through a significant change in leadership as 
principal Gary Giordano retired and new principal David Cugini was appointed. Last year, the school focused on 
elements of the Quality Review Rubric. Under 1.1 Curriruculm, 1.2 Pedagogy, and 4.2 Engage in structured 
professional collaborations on teams using an inquiry approach that promotes shared leadership and focuses on 
improved student learning, teachers and administrators implemented The Core Collaborative Impact Team model, 
which is supported by District 31, to review student work and identify gaps in achievement for students. The teams 
took that information and reviewed their lessons to see how the lessons could be modified to ensure that all students 
were meeting either proficiency or mastery in specific areas. Teachers were also asked to focus on student-centered 
learning, where teachers operated as facilitators and developed instruction that allowed students explore open-
ended questions or issues and construct their knowledge. Teachers were also asked to provide opportunities for 
students to provide peer-review and opportunities for revision in student work. These initiatives also align to Rigorous 
Instruction and Collaborative Teachers of the Framework for Great Schools . Teams met bi-monthly, shared their 
agendas and notes on Google Drive so people could participate virtually or check-in if they were also a member of 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

another team. Teachers grappled with the change of focus for an in-class lesson and some departments and teachers 
began to take the lead in modeling what student-center practices look like in a classroom. 

The school also focused on school discipline. Reviewing data from previous school years, school staff implemented 
Therapeutic Crisis Intervention for Schools (TCIS), developed by Cornell University and supported by District 31. 
Through the efforts of the staff, students received 100 fewer suspensions in 2017-2018 compared to the previous 
year. In addition, the Wagner Culture Committee was formed in Spring term. The committee held multiple "town hall" 
style meetings allowing any students or staff to come to the meeting to discuss what it means to be a member of our 
community and begin to define key traits that we want everyone in our community to demonstrate. 

Susan Wagner High School also received a Quality Review which provided feedback on areas of strength for the 
school as well as areas of focus for the upcoming school year. The school was identified as being well-developed in 1.3 
Make strategic organizational decisions to support the school’s instructional goals and meet student learning needs, 
as evidenced by meaningful student work products, 1.4 Maintain a culture of mutual trust and positive attitudes that 
supports the academic and personal growth of students and adults, and 3.4 Establish a culture for learning that 
communicates high expectations to staff, students and families, and provide supports to achieve those expectations. 
Quality Review Indicator 3.4 was identified as an area of celebration, which also relates to the Framework for Great 
Schools' Supportive Environment and Strong Family-Community Ties. We are proud that we were able to achieve this 
distinction without having a parent coordinator for the year due to medical issues. 

Our school focus for 2018-2019 will revolve around the feedback the school received during the Quality Review and 
other data sources. While being rated "proficient", 4.2 Engage in structured professional collaborations on teams 
using an inquiry approach that promotes shared leadership and focuses on improved student learning was identified 
as an Area of Focus. As a school we recognized that our Impact Team work was in it's infancy stage. There will be 
continuing professional development and sharing in-house expertise to strengthen our practice. Impact Teams will 
focus on identifying priority standards within their curriculum and ensure that they are the focus of lesson planning 
and assessment. The Quality Review feedback also identified uneven practice in classrooms. This was also expected 
with the shift in focus to student-centered instruction. If we continue to make progress in these areas then the school 
will be able to continue to support the Chancellor's vision of equity and excellence for all students. The school will 
continue to develop tracking mechanisms to monitor the progress of students with disabilities as well as student sub-
groups that are under-performing compared to other peers.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
After a review of the school's 2018 School Quality Review, school year 2017 School Quality Guide, and Advance 
ratings from school year 2017, it was identified that there was inconsistency in instructional rigor throughout the 
building. Based on the School Quality Guide, 50% of students say that they are challenged in their classes, which is 8% 
below the borough average. 52% of students say that teachers ask difficult questions in class, which is 6% below the 
borough average. To improve consistency of rigorous instruction throughout the building, it was identified that 
instructional planning should be a focus (Danielson 1e). Lesson plans and assessments will be aligned to priority 
standards that are identified by subject-specific Impact Teams. By identifying these standards, teachers can provide 
specific feedback to students on critical skills or concepts that will allow them to be successful in the course of study. 
This will also provide targeted feedback to ensure Equity and Excellence for all students. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, all school Impact Teams will collaboratively identify priority standards from NY State, CCLS, and Next 
Generation standards, which will increase the rigor of daily instruction as measured by 80% compliance in all observed 
lessons (Danielson 1e) during the final round of observations.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 
Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

1. Wagner High School’s professional learning community 
meetings provide teachers with the opportunity to collaborate 
each Monday. This collaboration addresses the instructional 
expectations included in Advance, through “shared practices” 
sessions. It also organizes teachers into Impact Teams based on 
the subjects they teach. During Impact Teams, teachers will 
identify priority standards, lesson plan, and review student 
achievement through the EAA protocol provided by the Core 
Collaborative.  

2. The School Development Committee also schedules and 
implements professional development in areas that teachers 
have identified in their own professional goals that were 
established in September as part of their Individual Planning 
Conferences (IPCs).  

3. Principal and Assistant Principals will set up and follow a 
schedule for teacher observations and feedback as it relates to 
this research based rubric. Formal observation questioning 
techniques based on depth of knowledge, and Bloom’s 
Taxonomy will be utilized to provide feedback to teachers. 
Assistant Principals will also review classroom physical space for 
environment conducive to active student engagement. During 
each lesson, the expectation will be set that actionable feedback 
to students be delivered.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
After review of Advance components 2a and 2d, we have found that most teachers effectively create an environment 
of respect and rapport, and manage their classrooms with regard to behavior well, taking into account the needs of 
each student and respect their students’ dignity. Additionally, our 2018 Quality Review celebrated our ability to 
establish a culture for learning that communicates high expectations to staff, students and families. However, there is 
still a need to reduce the number of school wide Principal's suspensions, especially with regard to Students with 
Disabilities. To further build upon an environment that is supportive to all learners, all students will be able to identify 
a “go-to” adult in the building who will connect the academic and personal behaviors needed to successfully complete 
high school to those behaviors needed to persevere through college to earn a college degree.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 9th grade Learning Center teachers will deliver social-emotional learning lessons to students to increase 
student engagement and belonging, resulting in a 5% increase in positive responses on the school year 2018 Student 
Perception Survey regarding having a "go-to" adult.

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

1. The learning center is a pivotal place for disseminating 
information to students about getting to the next level. As each 
learning center has a teacher coordinator, a guidance counselor, 
an Assistant Principal, dean, family worker- there are several 
venues for receiving information. Students know to turn to the 
trusted staff members within the learning centers for academic 
and/or social emotional support. The learning center coordinator 
will conduct parent sessions that share all activities, programs 
and partnerships in a format and language that all parents can 
understand. 

2. This will be completed in conjunction with the assessment of 
students’ academic and personal behaviors that support 
academic readiness by examining student work through the use 
of a school-wide portfolio system in all departments. Additionally 
this year, we will implement a social-emotional learning survey 
to all 9th grade students. 9th grade learning center teachers will 
receive professional development on delivering social-emotional 
learning instruction. 

3. Pupilpath will be utilized as a vehicle for communicating with 
parents about both academic and behavioral growth throughout 
the year. Suspension reports will be shared with all guidance 
counselors and teachers so that staff may assist students in their 
transition back to the classroom. Filemaker Pro is a software to 
open communication between the Dean's Office and Guidance.

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In the 2017-2018 Quality Review, our school received a Well Developed on 3.4 (High Expectations) which revealed 
teachers consistently communicate elevated expectations and created well coordinated systems for accountability 
and support through written, verbal, and online means.  

Under 4.2 (Teacher Teams and Leadership Development) despite a Proficient rating, there were recommendations for 
more “school wide instructional coherence and increased student achievement for certain subgroups”. According to 
the QR a “vertical learning structure is being explored to ensure there is mastery of goals for special populations.”  

According to the School Perception Survey 70% of teachers say they take responsibility for improving the school. 64% 
have the opportunity to work with teachers at other schools. The School Development has polled for opportunities for 
increased teacher autonomy and empowerment to improve curriculum expectations and future professional 
development opportunities.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, English Language Learner and Student With Disability inquiry team members will collaboratively analyze 
student performance tasks to improve problem solving skills as measured by a 3% percent increase in students scoring 
at or above passing rate on the Common Core Algebra I Regents. 

By June 2019, all faculty will have the opportunity to meet at least twice during the year in vertical department team 
meetings and horizontal interdisciplinary team meetings to improve the rigor of instruction and consistency of teaching

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to

1. Teachers throughout various subgroup areas noted above will 
participate in Professional Learning which will include shared 
practices during the school wide professional learning 
communities meetings and focus on the design of assessment 
and alignment of assessment to create cohesive and coherent 
curriculum. 

2. Subgroup and Impact team members will examine student 
work and curriculum from the 2017-2018 school year to identify 
and understand gaps in student knowledge and skills to inform 
the revision of their instructional units- this will occur during 
Professional Learning and during Common Planning Time. 

3. Teachers will horizontally and vertically plan to create 
comprehensive instruction aligning with school goals, Quality 
Review recommendations, data from Perception Surveys, and 
the introduction to the Next Generation Standards.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

After reviewing the 2017-2018 New York City Department of Education School Snapshot, Principal's Performance 
Review, student assessment data and our 2017-2018 Quality Review, leadership was commended for delivering 
feedback to teachers. "School leaders focus observation feedback on helping teachers understand that students need 
to use multiple skills to complete tasks and that they need both actionable and meaningful feedback aligned to 
standards to help them understand who they are as learners. Evidence reviewed during the school visit, illustrated that 
teachers are receiving feedback aligned to the above-mentioned foci areas." 

Examining Cohort Regents Data from the June 2018 Regents exams showed that 65% of all students in Cohort 2021 
scored 65 or higher on the Algebra I Regents, only 19% of SWD, 41% of Black, and 51% of Hispanic students scored a 
65% or higher. Focusing on priority standards that drive daily instruction and formative and summative assessment 
will help close the gap for sub-groups. Providing teachers scheduled professional development that is vertical and/or 
interdisciplinary will allow teachers to share strategies to increase student proficiency levels. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2018, school leaders will create and implement a professional development plan that builds teachers’ capacity 
to use priority standards in their lesson planning and assessment development to support student achievement for sub-
groups, especially in Algebra I, resulting in a 3% increase in teachers improving one performance level reflected in 
component 1e Designing Coherent Instruction in Advance.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Susan E. Wagner High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

 

Susan E. Wagner High School will support parents and families of Title I students by:

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

RATIONALE:  Title III will allow Susan E. Wagner high School  to supplement mandated 
instruction with before school and after school classes during both the 2018-2019 and 2019 -
2020 school years. Classes will focus on necessary skills (Reading, Writing, Listening, 
Speaking) needed for assessments such as New York State Regents exams and the New York 
State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT). The classes will use 
similar methodology, SIOP (Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol) teaching model as in 
day school, and will place particular focus on meeting the individual needs of each 
student/groups based on deficiency areas.  Students will have the opportunity to build necessary 
English proficiency skills in all modalities (reading, writing, listening, speaking).  Before and 
After school Title III program instructors are Madeline Lombardi, Nicole Broecker, ENL 
teachers and ToniAnn Boccadifuoco,  Guidance Counselor.  The before school program will take 
place in our ENL Center in room B43B, from Monday-Friday, from 7:30am-8:05 am.  The class 
will be split in two groups, in an effort to provide one to one support.  Each students will be 
provided with a laptop to use during the program.  BrainPop ESL will be used to provide 
instruction during this before and after school program.  This will improve their English 
language skills in reading, writing, listening, and speaking.  BrainPop ESL is a software that will 
used to assist ELL students in their English acquisition and the visually stimulating content will 
keep students engaged with the material.  Susan E. Wagner High School believes technology is 
one of the best approaches to reaching and teaching our English language 
learners.  BrainPop ESL will assist ELL students in the areas in need of reinforcement, and the 
visually stimulating content will keep students engaged with the material.  The program will take 
place in room B43B, Wednesday-Friday, from 2:30pm-4pm.  ToniAnn Boccadifuoco will 
provide students with counseling services after school.  The Guidance Counselor will focus on 
College and Career Readiness. 
The rationale for this approach is to target problem areas individually at a time when students are 
away from their typical line of study. Day classes address the needs of students, but the emphasis 
is on the overall skill set of ELLs, and assignments are given in the context of a class; class 
work, homework, and exams are based on class materials and review what is being taught. The 
before school and after school classes focus the attention more on social and professional areas 
of growth and prepare the students by targeting specific areas of weakness (mostly reading 
and/or writing) and improving them in efforts to build skills appropriate to foster success, and 
college and career readiness. 
 
After analyzing our New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test data 
(NYSESLAT) from the Spring 2018, our results showed the ELL students made significant 
improvement on all levels. Direct instruction before school and after school will focus on 
providing support to our expanding students on NYSESLAT enrichment.  Priority will be given 
to our current ELL's.  As seats become available, our former students will also be invited. The 
program will run from September 2018-June 2019.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Susan E. Wagner High School uses  several different assessments to evaluate student literacy.  Performance assessments help 
to yield quality data on student literacy skills, and programs like Achieve3000  help to monitor improvements in literacy on an 
ongoing basis. Assessing student literacy is more than simply right and wrong responses on an assessment. Our ENL teachers 
look for patterns in writing passages and reading comprehension in order to see what the individual student's needs are. Once 
placed into the appropriate level of ENL within our school, the student is then monitored in accordance to parameters the 
teacher must follow. Common Core-aligned materials allow our ENL teachers to use common ground across all subject areas 
while assessing students, and adjustments are made as students show improvement in proficiency or lack thereof. All student 
data is shared with content area teachers to monitor and enhance instruction. 
 .     

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Upon the NYSITELL/NYSESLAT results, students are programmed to one of four proficiency levels: Entering, Emerging, 
Transition, Expanding, or Commanding. Students are encouraged to use Google translate with voice recognition feature, which 
enables students to be active participants throughout the lesson and improve lesson comprehension. On Empower 3000, 
students will digitally annotate the text, this is aligned to the regents and full audio will enable students to listen to the article 
and complete comprehension questions and Thought Question successfully and independently.  
 
School leadership has put Impact Teams in place to ensure that staff is implementing the structures that will enable English 
Language Learners to be successful across all content curriculum. Teachers are trained by licensed ENL teachers, with 
strategies on differentiating instruction. especially since most classrooms are composed of students with varying levels of 
English proficiency and subject area expertise. ENL teachers received training through the Borough Field Support Center, Office 
of DELLS and College and Career Readiness.  
 
Teachers are notified of the NYSESLAT/ NYSITELL results in order to identify and deliver lessons and strategies more effectively 
to meet their needs. Using the EDAT tool, school leadership and staff are able to identify trends and view results of all state 
assessments and data.  
 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
ENL program evaluation is a data-driven program.  Program success is linked with our adherence to current evaluation 
measures. In order to assess Annual Yearly Progress mandates, the ELL Guidance Counselor maintains constant 
communication with ENL and content area teachers to inform them of student progress. Data is compiled by the counselor in 
an effort to allow teachers to focus on instruction and to centralize all data. Data, including grades, attendance, ELA & Math 
Regents examination scores, and graduation rate are assessed and program success is determined. Also, the NYSESLAT results 
as well as ELA performance assessments which are administered every  marking period. Summative data allows all 
stakeholders to assess success and address areas of need for the next school year.  The ENL teachers utilize the 
NYSESLAT/NYSITELL as well as Empower 3000 to measure progress and identify areas of need. All four modalities are targets in 
which students require additional supports as they  meet criteria for current level and excel to the next.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once summative data has been gathered the interventions that are in place are, AIS tutoring, AM/PM classes, ENL teachers 
provide before and after school tutoring, and the ENL Guidance Counselor meets with student and parent/guardian to discuss 
academic progress and plan of action. The ENL Guidance Counselor also holds "Kid Talk" meetings. Kid Talks is a protocol that 
is focused on student work and development of successful strategies across content areas. The goal is to develop, share, and 
reinforce strategies to increase student success. The structure consists of a 30 minute meeting, facilitated by the Guidance 
Counselor and includes teachers from multiple subjects. The team summarizes the big picture and comes up with agreed upon 
next steps, which may include reinforcement, a reward, a teacher conference, academic strategy, phone call, home visit, etc.  
 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Students who have demonstrated academic weaknesses and are at risk of failing classes, or have not passed regent exams are 
in need of Academic Intervention Services.  
 
Students who are at risk and require further assistance are encouraged to attend tutoring available in all subject areas 
throughout the school year during their lunch period. Tutoring is held in the library and department offices. In addition, the 
ENL Center is available before school and after school to address students' academic needs. Students may also attend Saturday 
School throughout the year in order to fulfill graduation requirements 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

 

Susan E. Wagner High School provides the students with the following Academic  Intervention Services:  
 
* Extra instructional time to help students achieve the learning standards in the subject areas requiring AIS.  
* Support services to help students overcome barriers that are affecting their ability to learn, such as attendance problems, 
family related issues, discipline problems, and health related issues. Support services include school guidance and counseling 
services to improve attendance and coordination of services provided by other agencies.  
 
 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The outcome assessments that are used to evaluate and inform our ELL program are the NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, and Regent 
Exams (ELA, Math). We also use the RLAT from ATS to determine the student's level of English proficiency for proper program 
placement (Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding, and Commanding). 
  
School leadership has put Impact Teams in place to ensure that staff is implementing the structures that will enable English 
Language Learners to be successful across all content curriculum. School leadership provides the ENL teachers with results of 
the NYSESLAT and all New York State Regents via email. It is also available on EDAT.  
 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

In order to make adjustments to programs, we meet with the ENL Team and school administration and discuss the findings at 
staff meetings. Using the data, we will then discuss which strategies would work best to assist the students and teachers in this 
program to ensure progress can be made and how as a team, we can help the students. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

  Students are programmed according to their language proficiency and grade level. For ENL skills classes for Entering 
students, students are grouped according to their grade level, ie., 9-10 or 11-12, for two periods a day, Monday 
through Friday.  
 
For ENL skills classes for Transitioning students, students are grouped according to their grade level, i.e., 9-10 or 11-
12, for one period a day, Monday through Friday.  
 
For Expanding students, they are programmed to receive their mandated 180 minutes in their English class, for grades 
9 through 12.  
 
Commanding students are programmed to receive their mandated 90 minutes of integrated ENL- ELA in their English 
class for grades 9 thorugh 12.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

  At this time, Susan E. Wagner High School does not have a transitional-bilingual education program. However, once 
we reach the number of students who choose to be enrolled in such a program, Susan E. Wagner High School will 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

 

serve dual language students with sensitivity toward their native language and an aggressive methodology to achieve 
English proficiency . 
 
 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

 At this time, Susan E. Wagner High School does not have a dual language program. However, once we reach the 
number of students who choose to be enrolled in such a program, Susan E. Wagner High School will serve dual 
language students with sensitivity toward their native language and an aggressive methodology to achieve English 
proficiency . 
 
 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

ToniAnn Boccadifuoco, the ENL Guidance Counselor, ensures that each ELL student receives the mandated minutes for ENL by 
programming the students with ENL in mind first; content area classes are added to the program thereafter. Students are 
programmed for English ENL classes based on their grade level. If a student requires ENL Skills, the classes are added to their 
program as follows: An Entering student will receive two, 45 minute periods of ENL Skills. An Emerging student will have 1 
period of ENL Skills. A Transitioning student will have 1 period of ENL skills. Expanding and Commanding students do not 
receive ENL SKILLS classes. 
 
 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
    Content area ENL classes are heterogeneous in nature. That is, students of different levels of English proficiency take the 
class together. This is done because students are placed in the class based on their grade level. For example, students in Global 
History 1 will typically be freshmen in high school. The Global History 1 ENL class will consist of these freshmen, and they will 
represent each level of English proficiency (Entering,Emerging, transitioning, Commanding). This is not always the case, but the 
vast majority of ELLs will experience classes this way.Instruction of ELLS in the content area classes will be aided by the 
presence of an ENL teacher and a content area teacher. This will allow the ENL teacher to further, scaffold and support 
instruction of ELLs in the content areas. Instruction is also aided with strategies like a “buddy system”, where students with 
higher English proficiency levels are paired with students of lower proficiency levels to aid them with their learning. There is 
also native language support, such as bilingual dictionaries and glossaries, and bilingual library and reference books, to support 
ELL students. Much is done to pair students of similar native languages together, but when this is not possible, students are 
encouraged to stay after classes and attend tutoring. All instruction is aligned to the C.C.L.S. by integrating all objectives that 
address and support the content.  
  
All content area classes, like the English classes, are conducted strictly in English. Aids like Smartboards and reference tables, 
etc., are also delivered in English. Students are encouraged to seek native language help and teachers are provided with 
websites and other translation services to assist students who do not have native language “buddies” or who are in danger of 
falling behind. New strategies have also been put into place by the ENL teachers. These include, but are not limited to, 
incorporating content area material into ENL instruction and using content areas to facilitate the learning of English. The ENL 
teachers use grade-level material and scaffold it with content area material for additional support. This allows the students to 
be exposed to content area material in more than one class, with more than one teacher. The exposure and delivery of this 
material in different contexts is considered vital for content acquisition, and Susan E. Wagner High School will be looking at 
student performance closely to determine the success of these strategies  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

    Susan E. Wagner High School runs ENL only; instruction is 100% in English and native language evaluation is conducted in 
Spanish (Spanish Lab R). The initial interview with  the student is in both English and the home language.  Review students' 
prior school work in reading, writing, mathematics, in both English and home language.  If there is not sufficient school 
work,  we will use age and grade appropriate informal, culturally sensitive school based assessments or formal and informal 
assessments. 
 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a.  SIFE students are students who enter Susan E. Wagner High School as English language learners who have attended school 
in the United States for less than 12 months and who upon initial enrollment in schools are found to have two or more years 
below grade level in literacy in their home language and/or two or more years below grade level in math due to inconsistent or 
interrupted schooling prior to their arrival to the United States. 
 
 
Students are administered: 
The SIFE Oral Interview Questionnaire and Guidance Document 
The Multilingual Literacy SIFE Screener (MLS) 
The Writing Screener 
The SIFE English as a New Language (ENL) and Foundational Low Literacy Curriculum is utilized by students who are at a 3rd 
grade level or below in home language literacy, but are currently placed in secondary (middle and high) school where the 
instructional gap becomes greater.   Once a SIFE student is performing at or above the transitioning/intermediate level on the 
annual English language proficiency assessment, the student’s status as SIFE is removed, even though the student may 
continue to be identified as an English language learner.  
Newcomer ELLs are not only faced with the task of learning a new culture, they also need to begin the process of learning a 
new language. When at the beginning phases of culture shock, ELLs may simultaneously go through a linguistic phase which 
has been termed “a silent period” — an undetermined amount of time when new learners of English may opt not to 
communicate productively through speech (Krashen, 1982). Though they may not speak, students are still actively acquiring 
English through more receptive modes during this phase. Teachers are counseled to respect the silent period by not forcing 
ELLs to talk if they are not ready, however, newcomer ELLs should still be given opportunities to engage linguistically to the 
extent that they are willing or able to participate. 
Teachers also note that ELLs have many linguistic resources available to them in their first language, which can provide an 
outlet in their initial phases of English language learning. Native language use at beginning acquisition phases should be 
encouraged as it supports children’s attempts to access content. 
Having newcomers in a classroom provides many beneficial learning opportunities for all students. Though it may seem 
obvious that newcomers learn a great deal from being in classrooms in the U.S., what is less obvious is that their presence is a 
gateway to develop their English speaking classmates’ interests in different countries, cultures, customs, and geography. 
Newcomers by definition have rich experiences associated with their immigration stories, and have traveled and learned more 
languages than many of their classmates. All of these experiences offer pedagogical possibilities for storytelling and narrative 
writing to expand all students’ geographical and cultural understandings. One technique that encourages this cultural 
exchange is linguistic show-and tell. In this activity, newcomers bring in an item from their home country, and teach their 
classmates the word for the item in their first language. Depending on their English level, newcomers can give a basic 
description or demonstration related to the item for their classmates. These presentations can be individual, or facilitated by a 
teacher or parent, if necessary. For example, Ms. Lombardi and Ms. Broecker assist students in writing their immigration story 
and orally presenting it to the class or group.  
All parents are provided with access to Pupilpath to be informed of their child’s progress in all classes.   Teachers are able to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

communicate via email to parents.  For the parent’s convenience, messages on Pupilpath can be translated to their native 
languages as well as the use of language line to access a live interpreter.  
During differentiation activities, educators intentionally support the needs of ELLs, especially those with disabilities or who 
may be struggling.  By ensuring the approach to differentiation takes a “Can Do,” that is, an assets-based approach, building on 
student strengths and interests, rather than targeting areas of weakness or struggle which systematically seek out the 
positives about your students. 
Here are three steps to taken to ensure during a using an assets-based approach when differentiating instruction for language 
learners: 
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers differentiate  instruction for ELL-SWDs by: 
 
 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
 Students with disabilities have been given extra attention the last two years because of regulations that mandate the delivery 
of ENL minutes to them in the same manner as those ELL without IEPs. In an effort to promote the Least Restrictive 
Environment (LRE) for students with disabilities, ENL classes are held with both IEP and non-IEP ELLs in them. Susan E. Wagner 
High Schools is serving all students with disabilities with the minutes that are mandated for them, and the ENL teachers are 
using strategies for NYSESLAT improvement. ELL-SWD's are provided with ICT courses based on the requirements of their IEPs. 
In promoting the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE) for these ELLs, meetings are held with parents and teachers in order to 
discuss the ELL-SWD's progress in current classes and how they can benefit from less restrictive classes. ICT classes consist of 
60% general education students and 40% students with IEPs; this latter category includes ELL-SWDs. Courses in the arts (Art, 
Music) and Health classes are currently not ENL-formatted, and ELL students are engaged even further with students without 
IEPs in order to incorporate them into the overall school population.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
 ELLs have access to after-school programs at Susan E. Wagner High School to supplement their learning. After-school classes 
are held in the ENL Center and students are broken up into groups based on their areas of weakness; these areas are assessed 
by previous NYSESLAT scores. Students also have this class in place to have Regents exam review as well; these students have 
their group within the classroom. These classes are held once a week for two hours and the class focus is on the appropriate 
exams (ELA Regents in January/June, NYSESLAT in March/April) based on the time of year. Students, for example, will find 
themselves reading a passage aloud to work on reading skills (beneficial for both the ELA Regents and NYSESLAT exams) and 
speaking skills (beneficial for the NYSESLAT), and would be required to physically write answers in an attempt to assess and 
build comprehension and writing skills (beneficial for both exams). The feedback they are given by the ENL teacher is helpful in 
assisting students understand where their strengths and weaknesses are; understanding the teacher is an assessment of a 
student's listening skills (beneficial for both the ELA Regents exam and NYSESLAT)   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

  Susan E. Wagner High School is looking to expand Saturday College and Career Readiness classes which include classes led by 
the ELL Guidance Counselor, Ms. Boccadifuoco, the Assistant Principal of ENL/LOTE, Mr. Ambrosino, and our ENL teachers 
Ms. Broecker and Mrs. Lombardi. The program will focus on college and career readiness in line with the Common Core State 
Standards.  Some of the things we will work on is,college essay writing, resume writing, college applications, career choices, 
and SAT/ACT Prep. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Susan E. Wagner High School never had a bilingual program. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
  
Throughout the school year, ELL students are informed that they are open to participate in all clubs, organizations, and 
programs offered at Susan E. Wagner High School. Students also have the opportunity to create clubs if their interests are not 
represented presently at the school.  We also offer before and  after school tutoring with the ENL teachers, Nicole Broecker 
and Madeline Lombardi. Students  have access to computers, printers, and books. Students are able to work on their English 
and comprehension skills by using Achieve 3000, KHAN Academy, and Brain Pop ESL., 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
 ENL teachers use SMARTBOARDS to aid with instruction. The SMARTBoards allow for translations to occur due to internet 
access in the classroom. Teachers use BrainPOP and BrainPOP ESL which allow students use their listening and visual skills. 
Achieve3000 is another technological aid that is used in the computer labs at the school in order to monitor literacy levels and 
facilitate improvement . We also have a variety of bilingual glossaries and dictionaries for students to use  as well as 
ChromeBooks in the ENL center. In the ELA classes, Collections text book is used and a close reader which enable students to 
annotate and work on their reading comprehension. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

ENL students are able to use translators for those who have very limited English proficiency. We also use Language LIne, which 
is a school wide system that enables teachers and all school staff to make calls in the students' home language. The ENL 
Guidance Counselor uses this tool on a daily basis to reach the parents/guardians to discuss their academic progress. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

  Achieve3000 responds to student performance by adjusting work according to grade level and proficiency level. A beginner 
ELL, for example, may find material on a first-grade reading level. This level will increase as they improve their English 
proficiency. Because the NYSESLAT grade bands is 9-12, students are exposed to the same material throughout their time at 
Susan E. Wagner High School. All materials are purchased as well through vendors specifying age-specific texts and grade-
specific texts.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Susan E. Wagner High School does not share a building. We have an ENL center equipped with laptops, a SmartBoard, bilingual 
dictionaries, and Chrome Books to help the ELL students with their academics. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
At the beginning of each academic year, Susan E. Wagner High School holds a Student Orientation. There are breakout sessions 
within the orientation to allow for ELLs and their parents to meet and greet the ENL teachers, Guidance Counselor, Assistant 
Principal, and Parent Coordinator. They are able to ask questions about the program, and about the school in general. They 
take guided tours and participate in various "ice breaker" activities in order to become more familiar with the Susan E. Wagner 
High School community. 
  
Throughout the school year, ELL students are informed that they are open to participate in all clubs, organizations, and 
programs offered at Susan E. Wagner High School. Students also have the opportunity to create clubs if their interests are not 
represented presently at the school.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

 All current and former ELL students can choose to take elective language classes in Spanish, Italian, Latin or French at Susan E. 
Wagner High School, with the understanding that they are mandated to take at least one year of a Foreign Language to satisfy 
the graduation requirement. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Susan E. Wagner High School currently does not have a dual language program.    
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Susan E. Wagner High School provides professional development to all teachers and administrators that specifically address 
the needs of English language learners.  Fifteen percent of the required professional development hours for all teachers 
prescribed by CR Part 80 is dedicated to language acquisition, with a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and 
integrating language and content instruction for English language learners.  For all bilingual and English as new language 
teachers, fifty percent of the required professional development hours are dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with 
core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and 
content instruction for English language learners.  
 
 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The Susan E. Wagner High School ENL team meets with teachers once per month to provide them ENL strategies, support in 
the classroom.  In addition, they turn-key all materials that is received at professional developments they attend.   This fulfills 
the required 15% ELL specific professional development for all teachers as well as the 50% ELL specific professional 
development for ENL teachers per CR Part 154.2. 
Agendas and attendance are maintained and recorded at all sessions and filed in the ENL Center. 
 
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
 At Susan E. Wagner High School we utilize Tuesdays to hold meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals, student progress 
and language development, show student portfolios, and needs in all content areas. We encourage parent involvement and if 
parents are unable to attend, conference calls can be arranged. We also hold "Kid Talk" meetings on Mondays and Tuesdays 
after school, which are conferences with the teachers from each content area and the guidance counselor to discuss the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

 

student's academics. The Guidance Counselor keeps a record of these meetings in a binder as well on keeping a  log on ATS. If 
needed, Language Line is utilized for translation purposes. 
 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

 In order to get parent of ELLs involved,  Nicole Broecker and Madeline Lombardi, the ENL teachers arrange meetings on 
Tuesday afternoons. We try to be as accommodating as possible because many parents work long hours. We use Language 
Line, the DOE translation services to help with those parents who do not speak English. We also

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, David A. Cugini, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Upon arrival to Susan E. Wagner High School, a trained pedagogue assists parents with completing the Home 
Language Identification Survey (HLIS) to determine if they are eligible to be tested for ENL services. This is part of 
the enrollment procedure when all students arrive at the school. The Pupil Accounts Secretary maintains all of the 
documents, except the HLIS, and hands them to the parents to complete; the assigned pedagogue will meet with 
the parents for the first time to explain the HLIS and its significance. The assigned pedagogues explaining and 
assessing the HLIS are Madeline Lombardi and Nicole Broecker, ELL Coordinators, Grade Advisors and ENL 
Teachers at Susan E. Wagner High School. Pedagogue will ask the family if they prefer to see the HLIS in their 
home language, and he will accommodate the family with the survey that is available on the Department of 
Education's website. Further, the trained pedagogue will look to the school faculty and staff to assist the family 
with the informal interview, if needed. When a student indicates on the HLIS that they speak a language other 
than English, or that they communicate with their families in a language other than English, the student will meet 
once again with the trained pedagogue for an informal interview to determine final NYSITELL eligibility. The 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

students are encouraged to participate in this interview; the interview is conducted entirely in English. 
Interpretation will be coordinated within the school for this interview, if the family is unable to participate during 
the interview. Interpreters are first sought throughout the school, assuming the family has not already brought a 
volunteer to translate for them. This is acceptable if the translator meets Department of Education mandates. 
students and minors under the age of 18 cannot be used for interpretation services. Since this meeting will 
eventually involve academic progress during a conversation, Susan E. Wagner High School will adhere to 
Chancellor's Regulation A-663 even during the initial assessment and inform the family of the regulation. . 

Among the paperwork that must be completed, parents are given the Parent Program Selection Form so that they 
can indicate which of the three programs offered their preference for their child is. Once the parents complete 
this survey, the trained pedagogue goes over the survey with them. In the event that the parent selects a program 
that is not Freestanding ESL (the program currently offered at Susan E. Wagner High School), the pedagogue 
explains that Susan E. Wagner High School will open a bilingual program for their language once there are 20 
students who speak said language in one grade (for example, 20 Spanish-speaking students in the 9th grade) who 
also elect to be in one of the programs (Dual Language or Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE)). 

Parent Surveys are done immediately to prevent issues with return of the Parent Survey and Program Selection 
Form. If the forms cannot be completed during enrollment, parents will be called to come in to complete them. 
Parent Survey and Program Selection Forms are kept in the student's file. A record of the parents' choice is filed in 
the Home Language Identification Survey Binder.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

their child's schedule, meet their 
teachers, and view the curriculum for 
each class. Translation services are 
provided as needed, either through 
the Translation and Interpretation 
Unit, or through Susan E. Wagner High 
School's faculty and staff, which speak 
a bevy of languages.While the

Implemented as of Fall 2016, Susan E. 
Wagner has dedicated Tuesday 
afternoons from 2:30pm to 3:45pm to 
parent outreach. Parents are 
encouraged to attend meetings with 
their child's guidance counselor and 
teachers to discuss progress. When a 
parent is unable to attend such 
meetings in person, they may attend 
via conference call. This program has 
been met with positive feedback from 
both staff and parents. Translation and 
interpretation services are provided as 
needed. 

Any assistance that parents require is 
addressed at Susan E. Wagner High 
School and all measures are taken to 
ensure that parents are given 
correspondance in their native 
languages. The aforementioned list of 
pedagogues in the school participate in 
parent meetings, when needed, and 
the ATS system that is used for student 
and parent information allows Susan E. 
Wagner High School to send letters 
and documents to parents in their 
native languages. All official 
documentation can also be sent to the 
Department of Education Translation 
and Interpretation Unit, should all 
options within the school be 
exhausted. 

Data regarding home languages can be 
found using the ATS system; reports 
that indicate home language and/or 
place of birth help us direct all 
correspondence with parents. It 
should be noted here that although a 
student may pass the NYSITELL and 
will not require ENL services, the 
school will still send correspondence

and accommodate parents who speak 
a language other than English, if this 
option is exercised by the parent. The 
ATS system will clearly show the 
difference; the home language and the 
parent's preferred language are on 
two different screens within ATS. 
Parents are also encouraged to contact 
the school when information has 
reached them that is not in their native 
language. Every effort is made to 
accommodate parents within the 
school, and the Translation and

Upon arrival to Susan E. Wagner High School, a trained pedagogue assists parents with completing the Home 
Language Identification Survey (HLIS) to determine if they are eligible to be tested for ENL services. This is part of the 
enrollment procedure when all students arrive at the school. The Pupil Accounts Secretary maintains all of the 
documents, except the HLIS, and hands them to the parents to complete; the assigned pedagogue will meet with the 
parents for the first time to explain the HLIS and its significance. The assigned pedagogues explaining and assessing 
the HLIS are Madeline Lombardi and Nicole Broecker, ELL Coordinators, Grade Advisors and ENL Teachers at Susan E. 
Wagner High School.Pedagogue will ask the family if they prefer to see the HLIS in their home language, and he will 
accommodate the family with the survey that is available on the Department of Education's website. Further, the

trained pedagogue will look to the school faculty and staff to assist the family with the informal interview, if needed. 
When a student indicates on the HLIS that they speak a language other than English, or that they communicate with 
their families in a language other than English, the student will meet once again with the trained pedagogue for an 
informal interview to determine final NYSITELL eligibility. The students are encouraged to participate in this interview; 
the interview is conducted entirely in English. Interpretation will be coordinated within the school for this interview, if 
the family is unable to participate during the interview. Interpreters are first sought throughout the school, assuming 
the family has not already brought a volunteer to translate for them. This is acceptable if the translator meets 
Department of Education mandates; students and minors under the age of 18 cannot be used for interpretation 
services. Since this meeting will eventually involve academic progress during a conversation, Susan E. Wagner High 
School will adhere to Chancellor's Regulation A-663 even during the initial assessment and inform the family of the 
regulation. All notification documents can be found on the Note that all notification documents can be found at the
