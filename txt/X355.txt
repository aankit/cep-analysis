Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

 

Our Mission: 

To develop scholar's aptitude, attitude, and appreciation for academic excellence, cultural diversity, and social justice. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Bronx Alliance Middle School opened in September 2013. As one of three small schools on a middle school campus, 
Bronx Alliance grew one grade per year as the host school, John Philip Sousa Middle School (Sousa) phased out, the 
intention being Bronx Alliance would be the last of three schools to replace Sousa, a persistently low-achieving school, 
and reverse the trend of poor academic outcomes for students. Located in the Northeast Bronx, across the street 
from the Baychester and Edenwald Houses, the largest public housing development in the Bronx, and the Baychester 
Houses. Bronx Alliance is a part of a diverse, vibrant community and remains unapologetically committed to 
improving the lives of the students, families, and community it serves. 

At the end of the 2016 school year, Bronx Alliance's founding principal and current assistant principal moved to 
different schools and a new acting principal was assigned. In January 2017, a new interim acting assistant principal 
was hired.  

Our Vision (Adopted June 2017): 
An alliance committed to raising social justice leaders able to apply critical thinking and literacy skills to resolve real 
world problems that plague our neighbors, communities, and world. A beacon of strength and pride, Bronx Alliance 
engenders hope, encourages diversity, and incites activism in and through the lives of our students, families, and 
community. 

Our Values 

  Persistence. Pushing forward in the face of fear, fatigue, and failure. 
  Accountability. Living proactively, responsibly and with the courage to own mistakes. 
  Communication. Listening to understand, speaking to clarify, and connecting to uplift 
  Teamwork. Encouraging and empowering others to pursue healthy goals 

Staff Commitments 

  We promise to bring our personal best to all we say and do, every single day.  
  We are dedicated to being curious, creative and critical in our thinking and in our work as collaborative 

problem solvers.  

  We pledge to be accountable for our actions, and we accomplish this by being self-disciplined, being 

responsible, and having the grit necessary to get the job done.  

  We work as a team and together we support and care for every single member of our learning community. 
  We are optimistic about our futures; we work hard to achieve our goals and our eyes are always on the prize--

Motto 

“If you want to go FAST, go alone. If you want to go FAR, go together.” --African Proverb 

To accelerate progress toward realizing our mission, Bronx Alliance strives to: 

  ensure every student at Bronx Alliance is known well by at least one staff member and typically more than 

one. Advisory classes are conducted two to three periods a week and are focused on building strong staff-to-
student and student-to-student relationships and trust. Staff Advisors mentor their Advisory students to 
ensure that all barriers to student success and achievement are identified and eliminated. Further, advisors 
support students in building and organizing their promotion portfolios and serve as a primary point of contact 
for families.  
acknowledges on-PACT student behaviors and students participate in monthly PBIS activities. When off-PACT 
behavior occurs, we use a Restorative Justice approach designed to repair relationships and/or to give 
students the opportunity to give back to the school community. Our Dean of Students/Restorative Justice

Coordinator is LSCI (Life Skills Crisis Intervention) trained. The LSCI approach to discipline supports students to 
make more responsible choices, learn more skillful behaviors and develop greater personal efficacy and 
accountability. 
Form strategic partnerships with several organizations. Two times per week a Literacy and Math Consultant 
through a partnership with Creative School Services provide support to teachers around curriculum, 
assessment and lesson planning as well as on their individual pedagogical practice. Consultants also work with 
teachers on their team approach to teaching and learning and conduct informal visits to classrooms. Through 
our partnership with Counseling in Schools, we have two full-time Social Workers on staff who provide social 
and emotional support to over sixty of our students through individual or group counseling and art therapy. A 
partnership with Education through Music will provide instruction in Band and Musical Theory for all students 
in the coming year. Student Peer Mediation training is provided through a partnership with The Leadership 
Program. A new initiative for this school year is our selection to participate in the Middle School Quality 
Initiative (MSQI) which will bring a literacy focus across content area classrooms to raise student reading 
comprehension levels. 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Students with Disabilities comprise twenty-two percent of the Bronx Alliance student body. They are served via SETSS, 
ICT, 12:1 and 12:1:1 classes. Approximately nine percent of students are English Language Learners and receive push-
in ESL instruction. All of these students require targeted and differentiated supports to enable them to make 
accelerated progress toward end-of-year learning targets. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The area of The Framework for Great Schools that the school has been least successful, as evidenced by the 2015-
2016 School Survey, is Supportive Environment. Thus, a focus for this year is ensuring teachers and students feel safe, 
supported and academically challenged. Our focus on Advisory, relationship-building and Restorative Justice practices 
have significantly contributed to the creation of a positive and safe school culture. A fully CCLS-aligned curriculum has 
created productive struggle and high expectations for student achievement. All school quality frameworks rated 
below average except for Strong Family community Ties which rated above the City average. 

The key areas of focus for the upcoming school year are Rigorous Instruction and Collaborative Teachers, as we 
embark on the Middle School Quality Initiative to improve literacy instruction in support across all content areas as 
well as develop stronger teacher teams focused on content area inquiry.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Data suggests that a weakness in the area of Rigorous Instruction at Bronx Alliance Middle School. The most recent 
School Quality Review (2014) revealed that indicator 1.1, Rigorous Instruction, was an area of needed improvement 
as the school earned a "Developing" rating. In regard to student outcomes, the percentage of students achieving Level 
3 or 4 on the NYS ELA and increased from 12% to 21% in 2017 as compared to 2016. In 2018, 23% of students 
achieved a Level 3 or 4 on the NYS ELA test. In Math, students achieving Level 3 and 4 on NYS Math tests increased 
from 5% to 7% in 2017 as compared to 2016. In 2018, 9% of students achieved a Level 3 or 4 on the NYS Math test.  

The school's strengths have been in improving the extent to which the ELA curriculum and instruction, resulting in a 
91% increase in the number of students meeting standards on the 2017 NYS ELA test as compared to the year before. 
Progress in literacy outcomes continued, though at a slower rate, in 2018.  

Outcomes on the 2017 New York State English Language Arts and Math assessments reflected further improvements 
in student outcomes in both subject areas. The percentage of students scoring proficient in English Language Arts and 
Math increased by eight points and two points, respectively. Additionally, there was a decrease in the percent of 
students scoring at Level one in all subgroups for both subject areas except with Students with Disabilities where 
there was an increase in students scoring Level 1 on the Math exam, specifically for boys of color. In 2018, there was 
an increase in the percentage of students scoring at Level 1 and Levels 3 & 4 in both ELA and Math. This suggests 
more work is needed supporting lower-performing students towards mastery.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, students will improve median math scores for all subgroups by at least five percent as measured by a 
comparison of the September baseline and June end-of-year New York City performance assessment.

Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Bronx Alliance Middle School has invested in staffing a full-time Guidance Counselor, School Social Worker, Dean of 
Discipline, and Leader Activities Coordinator to support students, staff, and families in ensuring the social-emotional 
needs of students are met. In addition to these full-time personnel, twenty-six staff members have been tapped to 
serve as Advisors that meet with students at the beginning and end of each day and for an Advisory period on 
alternating days. Advisors receive ongoing support from the Guidance Counselor and Assistant Principal in executing 
our Advisory curriculum. 

Further, Bronx Alliance leverages the resources of an on-site Montefiore Health Clinic to connect students and 
families with mental and physical health services as needed. This need is reflected in academic outcomes, disciplinary 
infractions, and chronic truancy in too many of our students. We are currently working to create a more supportive 
school environment by equipping and empowering teachers, specifically early-career teachers, and staff to be more 
attentive, proactive, and effective in meeting the social, emotional, and academic needs of students and families. To 
this end, all teachers have developed Classroom Culture Plans that are used by administrators and the Dean of 
Discipline to provide targeted, differentiated support around classroom management and community building. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, reduce the chronic truancy rate to less than 30% as measured by the daily ATS attendance rate.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

2018 School Quality Survey results suggests both students and teachers believe teachers respect students cultures 
and plan appropriate interventions to improve student learning. However, most measures in this metric are below the 
city average and have fallen below the city average for the last four years. The data also suggests teachers need more 
opportunities to develop, grow, and contribute to the continuous improvement of the school community. Specifically, 
in the area of innovation and collective responsibility and school commitment. 

Priorities in this area include increased opportunities for teacher engagement and leadership in the continuous school

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

During the 2016-17 school year, teacher's regularly met as teams to address concerns with curriculum and instruction. 
Teacher leaders were identified and regularly collaborated with one another and the administrative team. Teacher 
leaders were involved in the curriculum revision process as well as school programming and planning. 

While structures for teacher leadership and collaboration were in place, evidence of the impact of this work was 
scant. Curriculum maps for several disciplines were missing or incomplete and no clear link between teacher 
leadership and collaboration on improved student outcomes were surfaced. Further, the 2015 Learning Survey 
indicates below average ratings for "Teacher Influence" and "Program Coherence" within the Effective School 
Leadership metric. Such data suggests connecting distributive leadership practices with improved student outcomes is 
a priority. 

School Quality Metrics for Effective Leadership dropped from 4.1 in 2017 to 2.65 in 2018. The negative growth is 
attributable to lower ratings in Program Coherence and Teacher Influence. This data suggests a need for more teacher 
input in selecting and developing curriculum, school-wide instructional practices, and standards for student behaviors. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, ensure every classroom teacher engages in at least three cycles of inquiry-based lesson studies within a 
teacher team.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

School Quality Ratings for Strong Family and Community Ties dropped from 2.97 in 2017 to 2.64 in 2018. Strengths in 
this area center around the frequency and quality of communication families receive from the school and teachers. 
2018 data suggests families are not provided enough opportunities to volunteer at the school or visit classrooms. 

A priority for this year will be to improve our efforts to consistently communicate with parents as well as providing 
increased opportunities for families to visit classrooms and serve as volunteers.

identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, increase positive responses in the Strong Family-Community Ties section by at least one point to 3.64 as 
measured by a comparison of the 2018 and 2019 School Quality Survey.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Through increased outreach and advertisement on the school 
website, school app, phone blasts and backpacked fliers, parents 
will be encouraged to attend parent teacher conferences, parent 
workshops, breakfast with the principal and other school 
sponsored events, which will emphasize the importance of a 
strong home-school connection on student achievement levels. 

All teachers will maintain up to date student performance 
information on JupiterEd, the school’s online grading and 
communication tool, so that parents can be informed of their 
child’s performance on a daily basis. Skedula also provides a 
means of convenient communication between teachers and 
parents. 

Workshops will be held for parents at least three times per 
month; one afternoon per month during Family Engagement 
time, one evening per month before or after the PTA meeting 
and once per month on Saturdays. These meetings will provide 
strategies on how parents can help support and increase their 
child’s academic achievement and be combined with other 
topics that parents express interest in via our parent survey on 
the school website.  

 

Parent and student incentives will be offered to increase parent 
involvement centered on celebrations of student academic 
achievement, student talent and family – themed events. 

 

Families will be provided with a year-long calendar of events and 
a monthly newsletter to stay abreast of school activities and 
initiatives.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Strategies for recruiting highly qualified teachers include use of the Open Market Transfer System, New Teacher 
Finder, Teacher recruitment fairs and referrals from current staff and colleagues. The hiring committee conducts 
rigorous in-person interviews and highly qualified candidates are called back to conduct a demonstration lesson. 
Advance-level feedback is given to candidates after the demonstration lesson which communicates the high standards 
of teaching that is expected at Bronx Alliance. 

 

All teachers are mentored by veteran staff members who provide new staff with support and acclimation to the Bronx 
Alliance Learning environment. Participation in several collaborative meetings per week fosters a sense of community 
that is imperative in retaining staff. All teachers participate in on-site and off-site Professional Development to further 
their pedagogy. During the 2018– 2019 school year, all teachers will also participate in MSQI Professional 
Development over the course of the entire school year, including the summer. All staff who attend off-site PD are 
expected to turnkey their learning to the rest of the staff. 

All teachers have a voice and input and teachers are encouraged to bring their personal talents and interests into the 
school in the form of electives and after school clubs.  

 

Distributive leadership opportunities are an important factor in retaining highly qualified teachers. All teachers have 
the opportunity to lead various committees and initiatives in the school. Grade Leaders, Department Chairs, MSQI and 
SPOC are among the leadership roles that teachers can fill to enhance their involvement with the school 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development

assignment of a full-time Instructional Coach available to provide planning and material support to teachers before, 
during, and after the school day.  

 

Bronx Alliance will partner with academic consultants in math to provide math teachers ongoing support to deepen 
content and pedagogical knowledge to improve curriculum, instruction, and learning. Additionally, two senior 
teachers will receive extensive training and support from the New Teacher Center to serve as teacher mentors for 
early-career teachers and teachers with Teacher Improvement Plans.  

 

Teacher Leaders will receive targeted, ongoing training and support from Administrators and Instructional Specialists 
from the Field Support Center. Monthly visitations coupled with inter-visitations with other schools in our district 
collaborative will provide Teacher Leaders with multiple opportunities to improve their instructional and leadership 
practice. 

 

Additionally, all teachers and paraprofessionals will engage in inquiry work as a member of a collaborative teacher 
team. Teacher teams will use the Inquiry Cycle to generate and apply new knowledge to improve curriculum 
instruction, and student learning.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33 

 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Bronx Alliance Middle School , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Bronx Alliance Middle School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator to serve as a liaison between the school and families. The Parent Coordinator or a 
dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the parents of children who 
attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The 
Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report 
with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36

children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Paste response to questions here:   The formative assessments Bronx Alliance will used are teacher made assessments and 
DRP. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Students will received one period of ENL instruction and scheduled time throughout the day to received bridge instruction 
with the ENL teacher. Classroom teachers and the bilingual teacher are scaffolding instruction for these students by supporting 
them in small group settings with native language support in order to meet the learning objectives designated in content units 
as well as second language acquisition. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The baseline/benchmark assessments used with be: is the DRP.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The students will received one period of ELL services that will be embedded in their school day. In addition, students will 
receive push in services.   
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
The school will convene a team to analyze the data. The data is used to differentiate within classes and assign students to 
appropriate reading levels during strategic reading.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
 In analyzing the data patterns across proficiency levels, the information reveals that students demonstrate progress from 
grade to grade as expected. As more students continue to take the NYSESLAT, they are moving up the scale to proficiency. 
Some student data was unavailable in ATS.  We make sure the child’s second language development is considered in 
instructional development by differentiating language modalities and assessing students in each modality. As our school 
population grows, we will have more data to support and drive instruction.    
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The assistant principal will analyze patterns and provide direction the the ELL team. The assistant principal will meet with the 
team twice a week.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

  In the 2017-18 school year Bronx Alliance Middle School will be operating at full capacity with a 6th-8th grade. The 
students are in heterogeneous classes. Classes are organized in cohorts. Each cohort consists of ELA, math, social 
studies and science teachers. Special education teachers co-teach in the ICT ELA and math classes and push-in and 
pull-out students in SETS class. We also have two self-contained Special Education 12/1 classes. ELA and Math classes 
are set up in 90-minute blocks. Science and social studies are provided in 45-minute periods.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

n/a 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

            ESL strategies are provided during all content areas, but more frequently during humanities periods. Currently Bronx 
Alliance has a variety of ELL students.  Students are placed in groups based on their proficiency level achieved on the NYSITELL 
and/or NYSESLAT. Language objectives are developed and taught through content area material through whole and small 
group instruction for the mandated time periods (360/180).   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Teachers build on background knowledge as a means to engage students and make connections throughout all content 
areas. Content vocabulary is presented in both English and Spanish for ELLs to make connections. Students use various types of 
graphic organizers to outline information and learn organizational techniques that support comprehension.     
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

     Students read independently every day in both languages.  Teachers use the Spanish LAB-R and informal assessment to 
evaluate students in their native language throughout the year. Spanish-speaking ELL students receive Spanish translations of 
most class materials as a means to support comprehension and build second language acquisition.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Currently we are not supporting any SIFE students. If SIFE students enter our program they will be supported with RTI 
methodologies and the mandated ESL hours in small group settings. Newcomers receive language support from the bilingual 
teacher that pushes into their classes as well as the content area teachers. Newcomers are immersed in a print rich 
environment with clearly defined and displayed content and language learning objectives. Classroom teachers and the 
bilingual teacher are scaffolding instruction for these students by supporting them in small group settings with native language 
support in order to meet the learning objectives designated in content units as well as second language acquisition. ELLS 
receiving service 4-6 years are supported by the bilingual teacher and content teachers through frequent conferencing and 
small group assessment. They also receive their mandated hours and test accommodations. Long-term ELLs are also supported 
by the bilingual teacher and content area teachers through conferencing and small group instruction. Long-term ELLs and 
former ELLs also receive their entitled accommodations. ELL-SWD’s are supported by the bilingual teacher, special education 
teacher, and content area teachers through a push-in and pull-out model based on their IEP. They are supported in a safe and 
structured environment put in place to educate the whole child. All students participate in strategic reading periods five times 
a week where they are engaged in reading programs tailored to their specific reading level.     
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Beginning in the 2017-18 school year, Bronx Alliance Middle School will implementation of MSQI. All students have taken the 
DRP and those who fell below criteria received a secondary diagnostic exam. In the coming weeks, every single student will be 
placed in a differentiated reading program tailored to fit their specific needs. Students will be engaging in various strategic 
reading periods in addition to their daily ELA classes. It is our school wide goal to promote literacy in all content areas and have 
all students reading at or above grade level.       
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
 The students are followed and discussed once a month their progress. Students will have available time during Expanding 
Learning Time to received assistance to attain the English proficiency. We also group them during strategic reading and then 
change the schedule to have a customized program.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Students will have available Expanded Learning Time (ELT), we have AIS teachers who are able to provide instructional support 
for the students. The team will hold student reviews of student's portfolio and meet with students adviser to create an action 
plan for the student. The plan will outline goals for the students and steps to obtain those goals.    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

2017-18 is Bronx Alliance Middle School's second year as a MSQI school. We have partially incorporated the implementation of 
the literacy based program. Strategic Reading has been successful but the other MSQI has not come to fruition. With the new 
addition of an assistant principal the use of the program grows more information about new programming will be available.     
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

n/a 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs. All students choose an elective class they wish to participate in 
weekly. Often ELL students branch off and choose varying electives as a way to meet other students. Our after school program 
caters to the academic and social emotional needs of students. Currently there are over 120 students participating in our after 
school program.     
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The school has purchased over 250 laptops for the use of all students. There are ipads and kindles available for students to use. 
Teachers this year will use Google Classroom to improve instructional goals. Students will have the possibility of 
communicating with teachers by receiving a secure Google account. Google Classroom will create access for the students to 
communicate quickly and received immediate feedback on assignments.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language support is provided by bilingual teacher in the classroom as needed. The bilingual parent coordinator also aids 
in staying in contact with Spanish speaking families.     
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All ELLs are placed in appropriate grade and age level classes based on their birthdays.     
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Bronx Alliance does share a building but our programming for ELL are not affected by the co-location.    
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
 The ELLs and their families are welcomed. The school secretary ( admitting secretary) is trained to know when to gather 
certain information and then she will contact the appropriate stuff. The admitting secretary will contact the ESL teacher to 
begin the process of testing, if required, and conducting the home language survey , or gathering the necessary information to 
serve the newly enrolled student appropriately. An interview with parents and students in English and the home language is 
conducted. This includes reviewing documents, prior assessments, and academic experience. An assessment of the student’s 
abilities and/or work samples determines the student’s literacy and math levels in his/her home language. The parent 
coordinator is involved for new families to received more information about Bronx Alliance. The teacher within the 10 day time 
frame will complete his assessment and the student will begin their time with Bronx Alliance.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
    
Teachers of ELLs hold the appropriate teaching certificates and use their knowledge of second language acquisition to support 
our ELL population. The ESL teacher has attended LAP technical training sessions, NYSESLAT trainings and NYSITELL trainings. 
All teachers attend various professional development sessions centered in literacy techniques to support a diverse student 
population. The literacy coach and literacy consultant offer mentoring and professional development opportunities to all 
teachers.  
All teachers participate in professional development to familiarize themselves with the social emotional needs of our ELL 
population as they transition from elementary to middle school. The guidance counselor provides information and professional 
development opportunities for teachers seeking to further their knowledge of this area. 
  
All teachers participate in the mandated ESL training hours in order to effectively implement ESL strategies to our ELL students 
and to promptly identify students with disabilities. Records of all meetings and professional development sessions are 
maintained and recorded with a specific agenda of topics and sign-in sheet. All ELL related documents and literature is kept in 
a binder in the teacher’s office. All staff is informed of the materials in this binder and encouraged to review it as needed. Our 
administration and teachers serve as liaisons to our students’ parents to elicit information regarding parent needs and 
involvement. The guidance counselor, Kirby McLean, and parent coordinator, Marilyn Cattouse, provide all Spanish-speaking 
parents with all necessary documents. Parents are informed of the resources available on the NYCDOE website as well. Our 
school plans to increase all parent involvement by sending home parent surveys about our school and academic program 
information. The ESL and content teachers are in correspondence with ELL parents to discuss student and parent needs and 
opportunities to improve community involvement.   
    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The Team, led by the AP, will schedule PD for ESL and content areas teachers during the two years. 
The Principal has created a PD schedule for the teachers that would include training and workshops for the ESL and content 
teachers. The workshops will include a minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional development hours for 
all teachers prescribed by CR Part 80 must be dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-
teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English language learners. The AP will house a binder 
to keep the agendas and attendance for the PD.  The AP will also seek support for the Field Office to seek support in provide 
workshops to the teachers in the school.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The parent coordinator to schedules the meeting in September/October to host the annual individual meetings. The parent 
coordinator will work with the AP to draft a letter to parents inviting them. The parent coordinator speaks Spanish to 
accommodate the Spanish speaking parents.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
  The guidance counselor, Kirby McLean, and parent coordinator, Marilyn Cattouse, provide all Spanish-speaking parents with 
all necessary documents. Parents are informed of the resources available on the NYCDOE website as well. Our school plans to 
increase all parent involvement by sending home parent surveys about our school and academic program information. The ESL 
teachers are in correspondence with ELL parents to discuss student and parent needs, and opportunities to improve 
community involvement.   
    
  
 

 

 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
As previously mentioned, Bronx Alliance Middle School is a fairly new school. As the 2017-18 school year commences, we look

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Steven Cobb, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

Coordinator? Yes/No  

 

(*Primary) 

 

   

 
* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

At registration, every parent fills out a Home Language Identification Survey, which asks in what language the 
parent would like to receive written information and oral communication from the school. This data is collected 
and assessed to ensure that all parents receive information  

in a language they can understand.  

As part of the registration process, the Parent Coordinator conducts an orientation for new ELL parents, or an 
alternate time for orientation is scheduled. During the orientation meeting, parents view a video describing the 
programs available for English Language  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

Learners. This video is translated into several languages. After viewing the video, parents complete a survey in 
their home langauge asking them to select their first, second and third choice of program for their child.  

We are in need of school notices and parent workshop invitations to be sent home to one parent in Chinese, 
twenty parents in Spanish, three in Afrikaan and two in Arabic.. We also plan to provide parents with sample 
testing materials and practice tests to be translated in order to help their children at home prepare for state and 
city exams. We plan to also provide translated common core state standards.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.
