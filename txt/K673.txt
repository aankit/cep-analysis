Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

At East Brooklyn Community High School our students and staff will work collaboratively to redefine school so that it 
is relevant, tailored to the individual needs of our students, and creates opportunities for every one to experience 
personal and academic success. EBCHS is committed to graduating students with a quality education that prepares 
them for post secondary education, meaningful employment, healthy personal and family relationships and 
participation in the life of their communities 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
East Brooklyn Community High School (EBCHS) is a transfer school serving students between the ages 16-20 who have 
chosen to reengage in high school after having previously dropped out of school or become excessively truant. 
Students enter East Brooklyn with varying literacy and numeracy skills as well as different levels of postsecondary 
readiness. Our focus as a school is to ensure that our students are able to develop both academic skills and self-
sufficiency in order to be successful in whatever postsecondary path they choose. The merging of an academically 
rigorous program with effective personal development is the foundation of our approach to promoting a culture of 
high expectations, and this is made possible through our partnership with SCO Family of Services. The school is run in 
true partnership between the DOE and SCO Family Services. These are some of the key aspects of our partnership: 

● Advocate Counselors: A team of 6 advocate counselors, each with a caseload of 25 students, works with students 
and families from the moment they are admitted in order to establish goals, outline academic and behavioral 
expectations, create a plan for graduation, and develop a relationship with the family.  

● Future Focus Counselors: Once students have met a senior standing, 16 or fewer credits towards graduation and 3 
or fewer Regents Exams towards graduation, they are stepped up into a Future Focus caseload. The Future Focus 
counselor works with their caseload on post-secondary plans, graduation goals, and college and career exploration. 
Future Focus students work as a cohort on senior activities, college and career fairs, college visits and are monitored 
closely to ensure they stay on track for graduation and beyond. 

● Intensive Attendance Outreach: SCO Family of Services Advocate Counselors collect daily attendance information 
and reach out to students and families. Once a student has been absent for 3 days without contact, a home visit is 
conducted to establish reason for absence and/or create interventions for student. 

● Small Class Size: Most classes are between 15 and 20 students, with 25 as the maximum class size. We have 16 
teachers and 8 counselors serving 185 students so that every student is well known and has positive relationships 
with several adults. Creating these relationships is the first step towards supporting students to achieve higher 
standards.  

● Learning to Work (LTW) Program: Operated by SCO Family of Services, our Internship Coordinator establishes 
appropriate work sites, facilitates internships, teaches job readiness and employability skills, and follows student skill 
development at the site.  

● Shared Leadership: The school is co-led by a Department of Education Principal and a SCO Family of Services  

● Director that keep an equal focus on supporting students’ academic as well as their social emotional needs. EBCHS 
was identified by the Office of Postsecondary Readiness as a model school for our partnership between the DOE and 
SCO and is used as a site to train new school leaders. 

● Accelerated Credit Accumulation: A 3-cycle structure from September-December, December-March, and March-
June creates opportunity for students to earn 18 credits per school year during the regular school day and up to 21 
with our extended day, which includes blended online courses and internships for credit. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

● Personalized Programming: Each trimester we base the course offering on analysis of student transcripts/student 
need and then programming is done by students’ counselors, basing decisions on individual student needs and 
promoting high expectation for students ability to move towards their postsecondary goals at a rigorous pace.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our school has a growing SPED and ESL populations. Both of these groups biggest challenges are passing the Regents 
exams. Many of these students read well below their grade level and have accumulated credits at their previous 
school without learning the content knowledge or developing the reading and writing skills required to be successful 
on these exams. In addition because they arrive at our school behind in credits for their age we have limited amount 
of time to prepare them for graduation. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The Framework for Great Schools aligns closely with our school model, since we have a holistic approach to students 
and their success in school. The following are our strengths in the Framework:  

● Rigorous Instruction, Effective School Leadership, and Collaborative Teachers continue to be one of our schools 
greatest strengths. One of the key practices of our school is our professional learning, as it is how we ensure our 
classes are rigorous and that we are addressing the needs of all of our students. For the past four years we have used 
Japanese Lesson Study as the structure for our teacher team work and the teacher team work drives all of our 
teachers professional development. Teachers work in collaborative teams to work on improving their pedagogy based 
on the needs of students. The process involves (1) choosing a skill as a school wide focus (2) choosing a sub skill within 
each Dept (3) teams collaboratively planning lessons that develop these skills (4) select one students for each 
observer to focus on (5) evaluate the instruction based on its impact on the observed students (6) revise the teaching 
strategies based on what was learned (7) start another cycle of lesson study with a different teacher executing the 
lesson. Because of our work, we were chosen as a Learning Partners Plus Host school for the last three years where 
we share these practices with eight other schools. As a result we had model teacher positions which provided our 
strongest teacher with an increase in responsibility and salary which has helped us to retain our strongest teachers. 
The effectiveness of this work is evident in internal surveys, NYC DOE surveys, PPO, as well as our last SQR, where we 
received a well developed in 1.1, 1.2 and 4.2.  

● Building a Trusting Environment: Since the opening of our school a core belief has been that relationships matter 
and we must treat young adults with respect and foster a trusting relationship. This is core to the youth development 
principles that define our school and is reflected in our strong Learning Environment Surveys and in our most recent 
Framework for Great Schools Report. In addition we have always planned our staff meetings, observations and 
professional learning with the belief that similar to students, adults can only learn when they feel safe and are 
working in a trusting environment. This trust is evident in our well developed rating on indicator 4.2 of our last Quality 
Review.  

 

  One of the areas that we want to focus improving for this year relates to a specific aspect of rigorous 

instruction and our school's ability to improve students post secondary readiness. Our teacher teams will be 
working on improving student discussion as one of the key post secondary skills. The focus on this skill grew 
out of our work on vocabulary for the past two years where we observed that teachers need to develop more 
effective practices for improving students ability to have academic discussions and work effectively in teams. 
In our advisory program we will be focused on helping students develop stronger post secondary goals and 
plans that are based on a deeper self awareness and knowledge of their post secondary options. Both of 
these goals are focused on improving the rigor of instruction as it relates to students preparation to be 
successful after graduation from high school.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Strengths:  

● We have seen an increase in students reading comprehension, their ability to include more analysis in their writing, 
and their use of academic vocabulary over the past five years since we started using the lesson study structure for our 
teacher teams. 

● We have increased the number of classes that are team taught and developed strong co-teacher model for parallel 
teaching which has led to our students with IEPs having an equivalent if not better Regents pass rates, credit 
accumulation, and graduation rates then our gen. ed students. This occurred at the same time that our population of 
students with IEPs has grown significantly. 

The item analysis from the June Regents showed an Increase in our ELA essays scores and the Math scores on the 
open responses questions. Both of these increases were attribute to the work of those Depts in lesson study 

Needs:  

●  

- Over the past two years the size of our ENL student population significantly increased and the students pass rates on 
the Regents exams continues to be a significant challenge. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, through a focus on instruction, the Regents pass rates of ENL students will increase overall by at least 
10%.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 
development, and/or systems and structures needed 
to impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-
credited, SIFE, STH). 

 

We will include our ENL teacher in programming decisions so 
that she is co-teaching in the classes that will be the most 
important for our ENL students. 

Develop a literacy intervention class 

ENL students 
and low level

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Strengths:  

• The partnership with our CBO. Our school’s model is founded upon the principles of youth development. We have 
structures built into our school to ensure students social and emotional needs are being met, as well as their 
academic needs. Our community has worked in staff meetings to ensure this partnership is strong, refining different 
staff structures to ensure we are supporting students, while expecting them to grow socially and emotionally. This is a 
real strength of our school, as evidenced through our Quality Review and the comments on 3.4, our strong after 
school internship program, and our high Learning Environment Survey Results.  

• Last year our school had an overall attendance rate of 72%, which is well above average for transfer schools. The 
continued rise in attendance is reflective of the intensive attendance outreach our counselors do, as well as the 
inclusive environment our staff has created at our school. 

Needs:  

•Our students are often so focused on the challenges related to graduating from high school (social emotional need, 
attendance, credit accumulation and Regents exams) that they have not had enough time to do adequate post 
secondary planning. Our surveys of students before and after they graduate from EBCHS reflect the fact that students 
have not done adequate post secondary planning. We want to start students' post secondary planning process 
sooner, involve more staff, and give students more informed choices. 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 70% of our students will have post secondary plans that include reflections from their participation in 
at least two post secondary activities related to careers and post secondary education.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Successes:  

● Teachers aligning teaching strategies and sharing best practices. Throughout the past five years, we have drastically 
reorganized our PL plan to be centered around Japanese Lesson Study. In this process, teachers work in departments 
to plan together, evaluate students progress, and observe one another teach. Teachers are collaborating on 
curriculum and pedagogy, focusing both on what they are teaching and how they are teaching. Teachers share these 
practices at the end of every term, and we have seen an increase in teachers using the practices that we have 
identified as most effective in our observations of lessons.  

Need:  

● Many of the best practices within each Dept have not spread to other Depts. We have seen evidence of this from 
our classroom observations and participation in teacher team meetings. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, we will see 75% of our teachers have at least one of their observations reflect the teaching strategies that 
are identified in Lesson Study as the most effective for student discussion. In addition all teachers will receive a majority 
of Effective or Highly Effective in 3b of Danielson (Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques).

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Successes:  

● One of the major successes of our school in Effective School Leadership is the culture of inclusive leadership. Our 
school is run in partnership between the DOE and SCO and the DOE principal and SCO director truly share 
responsibility for running the school. In addition, we have created several avenues to ensure that various constituents 
have input in the school decision making process. We have monthly consultation committee meetings made up of 
counselors, teachers, and the Community Schools Liaison that brings issues up to leadership and brainstorms 
solutions. We have weekly full staff meetings to ensure the cabinet hears from a variety of staff voices. There is a 
student leadership that regularly presents ideas to administration. In addition, the principal and assistant principal 
meet biweekly with department heads to meet about lesson study and hear other academic concerns. Administration 
meets once a week to review upcoming issues, plan staff meetings, and meet about students. These structures have 
created a feeling of shared responsibility and ownership over the school. This is evident in our Framework for Great 
Schools Report of 2014, where we received a 97% on inclusive principal leadership and a 96% on teacher influence, 
program coherence, and principal instructional leadership.  

Needs:  

● We need to better leverage the teaching skills of our most veteran teachers, spread the most effective teaching 
practices across Depts and support the new teachers in their development 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2018, observations of teachers will reflect that 80% of the teachers that worked with model teachers improved 
their practice by adopting our schools most effective teaching practices.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths: 

• Outreach to families. One strength of our school is the intensive daily outreach our counselors do to the students 
and their families. Every day a student is not here, parents are contacted by the student’s counselor. Counselors also 
contact parents about updates in classes etc. This strength was demonstrated by our well-developed rating in our 
School Quality Review on indicator 3.4 (Establishing a culture for learning that communicates high expectations to 
staff, students, and families.) In addition, it is evident in the rise in our attendance (this past year our attendance rate 
was 72%) 

Needs:  

• The program that we have used for our gradebook (powerschools) hasn't been able to provide parents and students 
with the right kind of access to their grades and progress reports. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019 we will provide 100% of parents and students with access to their grades and progress reports and we will 
see an increase in the NYC DOE survey questions related to this area.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
In order to create interesting, engaging lessons for students that make them want to attend school, we recognize the 
need to have highly qualified teachers at East Brooklyn. We have partnered with New Visions to recruit highly 
qualified staff for our openings. We have organized a hiring committee. This committee has hosted several hiring 
events. Not only have we attended New Visions and DOE recruiting events, we have held open houses when we invite 
prospective teachers to tour the school. These are student run and give candidates a sense of our students and school 
community. Furthermore, all candidates have presented mini-lessons to our students after school and participated in 
a round table reflection on their lessons. Through these processes we are ensuring we have high quality teachers 
committed to improving their instructional practices. Once teachers are hired, we host a summer PD and then 
monthly meetings for new teachers. We are creating an internally funded model teacher position who will be working 
intensely with new teachers throughout the school year around classroom management and planning. We also 
structure our program to ensure new teachers can co-teach at least one class. All of these strategies have helped us 
to retain our strongest teachers all of whom are fully licensed and certified. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
We provide professional development to our teachers through our lesson study format. Teachers collaboratively 
examine student work, create lessons, teach, analyze work again, refine their lessons, and engage in collaborative 
processes to improve teaching. We also have a weekly staff meeting where we discuss youth development principles 
and issues pertinent to the school. Every summer, we pay teachers to come in and do additional training around 
lesson planning. Finally, the principal and assistant principal purposefully divide teachers to provide supervision 
aligned to the lesson study. This work involves not only observations, but planning sessions, examination of student 
data etc.

4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Our school is fully committed to empowering teachers in using and selecting multiple assessment measures. Since 
opening, our school has designed our own assessments, using a teacher and department created outcome-based 
grading system and teacher designed assessments. Teachers regularly review their outcome rubrics and student work 
in their departments to ensure the skills they are assessing are the appropriate level. After each Regents, departments 
conduct an item analysis and use this analysis to revise their outcomes and assessments. The coaching staff is 
currently doing a book study, focusing on “So what do they really know?” a book on formative assessment and its use 
to improve instruction. The coaching staff is then turn keying the ideas in this book to teachers to improve instruction 
in the school. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not

available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. East Brooklyn Community High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of 
Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community.

East Brooklyn Community High School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

  providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, 

e.g., literacy, math and use of technology; 

  providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

 

decision making in support of the education of their children; 
fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

  providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
 

sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and 
in languages that parents can understand; 

  providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and 
other members of the school community. 

 

3 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school. 

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

 

actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of 
the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

  Title I Priority and Focus Schools and the parents of students served in the Title I program must jointly agree 
upon the use of these additional funds to support increased parent engagement/education to enable parents 
to effectively support their child’s learning. 

  engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 

directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

  ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 

 

strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing 
technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills; 

  maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

 

  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

  host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise 

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right 
to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 
and other applicable sections under the ESSA;

Addendum: Community School Partnerships 

Directions: The Community School (CS) strategy is directly aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. Community 
Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and 
family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in 
Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & 
Wellness. 
 
Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s) 

How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student 
academic outcomes?  
Our focus as a school is to ensure that our students are able to develop both academic skills and self-sufficiency in 
order to be successful in whatever postsecondary path they choose. The merging of an academically rigorous program 
with effective personal development is the foundation of our approach to promoting a culture of high expectations, 
and this is made possible through our partnership with SCO Family of Services. The school is run in true partnership 
between the DOE and SCO Family Services. There is a large connection between academic success and attendance 
and if we can get students to come to school regularly, they will be overall, more likely to succeed in the classroom.  

 
Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to 
be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
Attendance Supports- We will strive for 77% over all attendance for the 2018-19 school year. One way we hope to 
achieve this goal is by being proactive as oppose to reactive when it comes to student absenteeism. Our goal is to 
have no more than 55% of students missing more than 20 days of school in the 2018-19 school year. Additionally, 
students who successfully receive specific partnership interventions will see an average increase on at least 8%.  

Expanded Learning Time- We hope to bring in at minimum two organizations that will empower students as well as 
teach them valuable skills. We are hoping to increase afterschool programming attendance by 10%.  

Family Engagement- Increase family attendance at monthly community school team meetings by 25%. 

Health and Wellness- 100% of the school population receives universal, supportive counseling services through the 
CBO (SCO Family of Services). Key findings of our mental health assessment were that more support for targeted 
interventions is needed as well as a streamline to mental health counseling outside of the building. It is because of 
this great need we have increased the hours the clinician for Interborough Developmental & Consultation Center, 
Inc. will be at the school for the 2018-19 school year. Our goal is to increase the clinician's caseload as well as have 
him push into advisory to discuss destigmatizing mental health, anger management and coping with stress and 
anxiety. Our school is currently a part of the CATCH program and our goal is to increase the number of students 
who participate in the program in hopes of getting regular check ups.  

 

 

Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s): 
How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family 
Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students? 
Attendance- After every two-three weeks students receive their benchmark grades so they are always aware of the 
progress in class. Moving forward, students will also have discussions around attendance. students who have 76%-
80% attendance will get a letter sent home. Student with attendance ranging from 71%-75% will having a meeting 
with their advocate counselor where they will review the importance of attendance and it's correlation to academic 
success. Together, with their advocate counselor, the student will develop an attendance goal and identify the 
supports they believe they will need to be successful. If a student has attendance between 66%-70% they are to meet 
with their advocate counselor and administration. Any student with under 65% will have a parent meeting. There is a

large connection between academic success and attendance and if we can get students to come to school regularly, 
they will be overall, more likely to succeed in the classroom.  

Expanded Learning Time- We are looking to build partnerships with different organizations and companies so we can 
offer more diverse afterschool programming. Our goal to increase student interest in post-secondary planning is 
closely linked with our goal of diversifying our expanded learning programs. 

Family Engagement- We will offer themed workshops with target populations based on feedback from CS Forum i.e. 
housing, immigration rights, career skills/building, future focus, know your rights. Our belief is that if we can 
increase family engagement, we can also increase student engagement. Parents are crucial to student success and 
if we can engage parents and build trust within the school community, we can create an environment where parent 
and students want to be in school because they know when they are here they will be helped.  

 

 
Part 2 – Community School Partnerships Core Services Action Plan 

Part 2a. Identify the Community-based Organization (CBO) partnerships that you will develop in ELT, Attendance 
Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & Wellness, their target student population(s), and scope of the services 
provided. As well as supporting schools’ supportive environment and attendance work, CBOs should be helping to 
support your school’s instructional focus.

empower students as 
well as build 
relationships amongst 
each other. 

Part 3a. Indicate resources your Community Partnership will leverage to achieve your summative SMART goal(s) and 
implement this action plan, including human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
● Community Schools Liaison: This staff member, funded through the Community School’s Grant, will oversee the 
Community Schools budget and ensure the action plan moves forward.  

● Staff Meeting: We have weekly staff meetings to discuss the needs of students in our school and ensure students 
are receiving the appropriate referrals.  

● Partnership with SCO: SCO provides us with 8 fulltime counselors. These counselors will all receive extensive 
training on the services available to students and be responsible for referring students for services.  

● Through our partnership with Interborough Developmental and Consultation Center, we will continue to address 
the needs of students who can benefit from mental health services. This paid partnership allows us to have one of 
Interborough’s mental health counselor’s onsite for 4 hours a day, 3 days a week, which helped augment mental 
health services currently offered at the school, as well as created a seamless pathway for students to seek intensive 
services at Interborough’s nearby clinic.  

● Through a subcontract with Ramapo for Children we will be able to take students in two groups to upstate New 
York where they will participate in ropes course and team building activities. 

● Under the leadership of the CSD a series of substantive incentives are developed to encourage improvement in 
attendance and school engagement. All prizes and trips are sponsored with Community School funding.

Part 3c. Describe how the school will partner with the Lead CBO to do the following: 
1. 

Community Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and 
together with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will 
lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating 
activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work. 
Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and 
services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time 
(ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the 
right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly 
coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day. 
Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to 
strengthen this initiative. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53

4. 

 

Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and 
families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of 
their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community 
School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement 
strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use. 
Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work. 

Our school community is deeply connected with this work; they participate in weekly staff meetings focused on 
attendance and academic progress. In these meetings teachers and counselors identify students and we discuss the 
posing challenge, the strengths of the student and possible appropriate interventions. We follow-up on students 
the following week and month to see if there is a change in student behavior or attendance since the interventions 
have been in place. The CBO staff with the school director, the assistant director and the CSD have weekly 
attendance meetings where the attendance data is reviewed and intervention plans are created to address any 
concerns or patterns that arise with students. 

We look forward to continuing to use the Community School Model to make our school a place where students 
want to be. When working with students who have been disengaged with school, they can often be triggered to 
leave school if they feel as if the school community is not invested in their success. The community school model 
allows room for students to have a voice in how school is run. It provides a platform for students and families to 
express what they think makes a school successful and by working with students and families we can 
collaboratively tackle challenges that our students are facing.  

Through a series of Community School Team Meetings the school community collectively comes up with themes for 
each meeting with a target population of parents they would like to see at the meetings. Student accomplishments 
are recognized at our honor roll dinners where families are invited to celebrate our students with the school 
community. Our annual Community Schools Forum will be held in May and provides another opportunity for 
families and staff to reflect on the school year and give input in how the school is doing. 

Whether it is through providing a space for students to showcase their talent or providing referrals for families to 
receive much needed resources, the community school model has improved the quality of our school culture. Our 
partnership with outside organizations are addressing many of the needs of our students without the run around 
that is often associated with acquiring services. Students are able to get free legal advice, vision screenings and 
quality mental health referrals without having to miss a day of learning to do so. By providing access to services 
such as the above mentioned we are breaking down obstacles and making access to education easier.  

 

 
Part 4 – Community School Partnerships Oversight 

Part 4a. Key Staff and Partners 
1.  Name and describe the scope of involvement of all community partners working in the school (include partners 

supporting ELT, counseling, enrichment, etc.) 

2.  Name the members of your Community School Team and how meetings will be organized and structured to 

engage all stakeholders and be focused on results. 

3.  Explain data strategies including the use of the data sorter, and steps that the school will take to ensure that the 

appropriate interventions are provided to the right students 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

The Community School Director will facilitate a monthly check-in conversation with all subcontractors. These 
conversations will focus on current events in the school, coordination of services, and identification of students in 
need of further support. 

Through weekly attendance meetings, students with patterns of absenteeism will be identified and interventions are 
discussed. Our attendance protocols make it possible to easily identify trends in attendance through the use of the 
data sorter. Attendance meetings take place on Mondays at 3:15pm. After every two-three weeks students receive 
their benchmark grades so they are always aware of the progress in class. Moving forward, students will also have 
discussions around attendance. students who have 76%-80% attendance will get a letter sent home. Student with 
attendance ranging from 71%-75% will having a meeting with their advocate counselor where they will review the 
importance of attendance and it's correlation to academic success. Together, with their advocate counselor, the 
student will develop an attendance goal and identify the supports they believe they will need to be successful. If a 
student has attendance between 66%-70% they are to meet with their advocate counselor and administration. Any 
student with under 65% will have a parent meeting. There is a large connection between academic success and 
attendance and if we can get students to come to school regularly, they will be overall, more likely to succeed in the 
classroom.  

The Community School Director will continue to take a leadership role in tracking attendance trends using the New 
Visions Heat Map and Community School interventions using the New Visions Student Sorter. In weekly attendance 
meetings, the CSD will meet with administrators and counseling staff to discuss attendance trends, red flags, and 
progress of intervention plans. During administrative cabinet meetings, the CSD will provide an overview of school-
wide data and develop plans for incentive trips, events, competitions, and other initiatives. In weekly full-staff 
meetings, the CSD will share big picture data and incentive plans. This information will also be shared on a monthly 
basis during Community School Team meetings, where students, alumni, families, and other community members can 
share feedback and ideas about school programs and student outcomes. 

The school has maintained a strong Community School Team throughout 2017-18, consisting of 10 SLT members and 
other interested staff, students, families, and community members. In 2018-19 we will continue to strengthen and 
expand this group, with a particular emphasis on including families and local community leaders. For each CST 
meeting, we will continue to identify pertinent themes or topics for discussion that will be of interest to attendees. 
We will also incorporate presentations from relevant community organizations on these topics, as well as occasional 
celebrations of successes and special holidays. We will make every effort to provide snacks and assistance with 
transportation and childcare for these meetings. This year, we will make special efforts to include designated 
community members CBO representatives, and alumni representatives as CST members (not just one-time visitors), 
and we will increase the development of CST subcommittees to meet separately in service of particular tasks 
(including Community School Forum planning, community needs assessment, and attendance incentive 
development). 

 
Part 4b. Indicate resources needed including human resources, instructional resources, and schedule adjustments to 
implement the Community School program. 
● Community Schools Liaison: This staff member, funded through the Community School’s Grant, will oversee the 
Community Schools budget and ensure the action plan moves forward.  

● Staff Meeting: We have weekly staff meetings to discuss the needs of students in our school and ensure students 
are receiving the appropriate referrals.

health services currently offered at the school, as well as created a seamless pathway for students to seek intensive 
services at Interborough’s nearby clinic.  

● Through a subcontract with Ramapo for Children we will be able to take students in two groups to upstate New 
York where they will participate in ropes course and team building activities. 

● Under the leadership of the CSD a series of substantive incentives are developed to encourage improvement in

Part 4c. Timeline for implementation and completion, including start and end dates. 
We will strive for 77% over all attendance for the 2018-19 school year. One way we hope to achieve this goal is by 
being proactive as oppose to reactive when it comes to student absenteeism. Our goal is to have no more than 55% 
of students missing more than 20 days of school in the 2018-19 school year. Additionally, students who successfully 
receive specific partnership interventions will see an average increase on at least 8%.  

We hope to bring in at minimum two organizations that will empower students as well as teach them valuable skills. 
We are hoping to increase afterschool programming attendance by 10% by the end of June 2019.  

Increase family attendance at monthly community school team meetings by 25%.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
At East Brooklyn, we work with students who are overaged and undercredited and often lacking certain literacy skills high 
school students need to be successful.  Our first step in assessing students is to look back at their eighth grade ELA and Math 
scores as well as previous Regents and NYSESLAT scores.  As a school we use a reading assessment QRI  to assess their reading 
abilities and do individual pull-out sessions with teacher created assessments to assess students literacy skills.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

All students are pulled out by ELA and SPED, ENL teachers to assess twice annually using a QRI. We also use Regents and 
course Assessments to review progress. We have intensive courses and small class sizes for students with ENL status, taught by 
a licensed ENL teacher. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We regularly looked at teacher created assessments, Regents scores, class pass rates, and NYSESLAT results to see the success 
of our program.   We will continue to evaluate the success of our current ELL students by examining these pieces of data.    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

. We have intensive courses and small class sizes for students with ENL status, taught by a licensed ENL teacher. We also have 
afterschool tutoring, Saturday school and lunch time teacher hours to help target students who need additional support. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
NA 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
NYSESLAT, English and History Regents   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Whole staff and department meetings are set aside for data analysis and to work on student programming. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

We use our ENL teacher as a co-teacher in a heterogeneous English and one content area per trimester. She also has a 
period for pull out support, and one designated class, meeting daily, for ENL instruction. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

NA 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

NA 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

       With the current programing, ENL students will all receive more than mandated number of minutes through the co-taught 
and pull out instruction. Additionally students who need more support will have access to additional instruction through our 
school group tutoring, and elective reading intensive ENL classes. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   So as to ensure that all students’ learning needs are being met, we provide our staff with training in Blooms Taxonomy, 
Sheltered Instructional Model, and teaching Literacy Strategies across the curriculum. Additionally, all textbooks and the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

books/audio tapes in our school library were selected to support the instructional program, were carefully reviewed, and were 
chosen for their effectiveness in engaging all students in the learning process.  As an ungraded school committed to 
heterogeneous grouping, the educational design has been developed to be able to meet the needs of all students.  The 
program utilizes an inclusion model with individualized assistance and support provided by our special ed. teacher who is 
trained in literacy.  Because of the curriculum’s strong emphasis on literacy and numeracy, any ELL students would have 
extensive opportunities to develop new skills in these areas within the classroom setting.  Our scope and sequence includes an 
intensive Reading Seminar class that introduces our students that struggle the most with literacy to the reading strategies. Any 
struggling ELL students would  programmed into this class.  ELLs in the school for less than three years would be placed in the 
intensive Reader's Classes and the core content classes that the Special Ed Instructor is pushing into, ensuring that they receive 
literacy support.  In addition, they would receive the hours of ELL instruction during 7th period.  ELLs receiving service 4 to 6 
years and Long Term ELLs would be programmed for a mix of intensive and general ed classes, depending on their periodic 
assessments and their individual weaknesses.  Similarly, they would work with the ELL teacher in 7th period.  Finally ELL 
students with special needs would receive all services mandated on their IEPs in the language required and also work with the 
ELL instructor during 7th period.    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

All students are interviewed with parents to assess which language they prefer to use for instruction/assessment. students are 
provided with both native and English language Regents, dictionaries and are allowed to use translation technology when 
appropriate on in class assessments. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 Any ELL students who entered the school would be programmed based on the credits they need as well as the academic 
skills.  ELLs in the school for less than three years and SIFE students would be placed in the intensive Reader's Classes and the 
core content classes that the Special Ed Instructor is pushing into, ensuring that they receive literacy support.  In addition, they 
would receive the hours of ELL instruction during 7th period.  ELLs receiving service 4 to 6 years and Long Term ELLs would be 
programmed for a mix of intensive and general ed classes, depending on their periodic assessments and their individual 
weaknesses.  Similarly, they would work with the ELL teacher in 7th period.  Finally ELL students with special needs would 
receive all services mandated on their IEPs in the language required and also work with the ELL instructor during 7th period.    
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers of ELL-SWDs continue to focus heavily on explicit instruction in the learning strategies and vocabulary development 
to provide access to academic content.  They preview materials with students, adapt assignments when necessary, and 
provide additional oral and written instruction and direction.  We will also be regularly using the Pearson Reading QRI to track 
student progress and identify new goals.           
  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our school believes in an inclusive model of special education.  All students are individually programmed based on their 
academic and credit needs and we provide our special education services in a push-in model to ensure students are educated 
in the Least Restrictive Environment.   They monitor progress through formative assessments, teacher created assessments, 
and statewide exams.

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
 We have an ELA co-taught class which focuses on literacy skills and increasing reading and writing fluency.   For students who 
need or desire more support there is an ENL literacy course offered as an elective credit each trimester.  There is afterschool 
SGI when needed, students may meet with content area teachers and the ENL teacher for additional support.  We offer math 
and science classes in English, many sections are co-taught with a SPED teacher.  The ENL teacher has co-planning periods with 
each department to review lessons, add scaffolds and help teachers improve instruction.   There is also SGI in math 
afterschool.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

This year, we have hired an ENL teacher to provide services.  In addition, we have hired an additional SPED teacher, allowing 
one of our three SPED teachers to focus solely on ELA and reading skills.  Finally, we are focusing as a school on vocabulary 
acquisition skills and vocabulary instruction.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

None 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Every student at EBCHS is afforded equal access to all programs.  After school, we have SGI which our ENL students are 
encouraged to come to, and we also have a LTW program, which she is also encouraged to attend.  We have bilingual staff 
who communicate these opportunities to parents.      
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Our school has access to a lot of computer technology and online courses.  Every class is equipped with a set of laptops and 
teachers and or students have continual access to online dictionaries and translators.  We have document projectors and 
smartboards in every room.   We also have access to News ELA which provides leveled academic readings to help increase 
reading fluency. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

We provide native language support through access to online translators and software designed to support ELLs in classrooms. 
           
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Since ELL students at our school are overaged and under credited, we always individually program students so the services and 
resources correspond to students age, grade levels, and credit needs.  ELL students will be programmed in the same way, while 
taking into account the need for additional language acquisition skills 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our school has access to a lot of computer technology and online courses.  Every class is equipped with a set of laptops and 
teachers and or students have continual access to online dictionaries and translators.  We have document projectors and 
smartboards in every room.   We also have access to Achieve 3000 which provides leveled academic readings to help increase 
reading fluency. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
 All students who are enrolled are paired with a counselor who conducts and interview with the student and the family.  The 
counselor conducts home visits and outreach to the family.  If we had a newly enrolled ELL student, we would pay particularly 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

close attention to the language needs of the student and family and communicate with teachers around the students 
needs.  Every two weeks we have progress reports and the counselor would work with the student to ensure he/she was 
passing classes and understanding the material.  When interventions are necessary, our SPED teacher and the counselor would 
work with teachers to differentiate instruction. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

We offer American Sign Languae as language electives to all students.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

NA    
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
We train all our staff on using Blooms Taxonomy, Sheltered Instructional Model, and teaching Literacy Strategies across the 
curriculum.   This year, we will utilize our lesson study process to have all teachers conduct action research on explicitly 
teaching vocabulary skills.    
At the beginning of the year, we have worked on teachers creating meaningful, common core aligned learning targets, and as 
they year goes of our departments will use non-lesson study meetings to focus on common core tasks and skills.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
We provide training for counselor's and teachers on supporting students through a strength-based approach and creating a 
positive school culture.  Counselors are given more in-depth trainings from a psychologist on supporting all students' social and 
emotional needs.  We have staff meetings where we discuss in depth different students strengths and areas to grow and then 
brainstorm intervention strategies.  One of these will be focused on our ELL students.  In addition, we will be trying to connect 
with external agencies to come in and run trainings on ENL students.      
We have counselors who are bilingual to assist students in applying to college, helping make a smoother transition for these 
students.  We will  dedicate at least 15% of our teacher PD to working on language allocation strategies and co-teacher 
strategies specific to ELL students.  We are currently spending all our department time working through the lesson study 
process on vocabulary acquisition and literacy skills.  In addition, we have recently hired another SPED teacher and are doing 
school wide PDs on co-teaching strategies.   
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

 

Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Our school partners with SCO Family Services to provide wraparound support for our students and families.  Each student has 
an advocate counselor who works with the family to ensure the student is successful in school.  We have advocate couselor's 
fluent in other languages and whenever a student's home language is not English, we assign a bilingual advocate counselor to 
the family.  In addition, we have an in depth interview process that includes a parent interview to help us assess the parent's 
needs. Currently our one ELL has had her parent come to the building for the interviews and has regular contact with her 
counselor.  We have regular parent meetings where teachers and administrators can discuss her language acquisition and 
progess on tests.    

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

We hold regular parent meetings and PTA meetings that cover a wide variety of topics related to students educational 
needs.  In addition, we are a community school and partnered with SCO Family Services to provide workshops and wraparound 
services to all parents in our school.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Patrick McGillicuddy, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Parent language preferences in our school are primarily assessed through our in person parent interviews when 
we discuss parent needs and wishes of how to be communicated with. We also look at blue cards and internal 
school surveys. About 95% of families wish to be communicated with in English.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

We will utilize bilingual staff when possible to translate, reach out to DOE translation services, including call lines 
when not possible. We also utilize connections to families and invite multiple members to be present at all events. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

We will provide time during our August PD to review familiarity with this Regulation and ask our support people to 
introduce themselves and train staff on how to request, provide and schedule translation services for parent 
communication.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

          Issued translated signage is posted by school security at the entrance to the building, in the main office and in 
administrative offices. During intake information is shared, verbally and in paperwork. We request bilingual staff and 
or students be available for translation services at celebrations and have designated rooms for translation services for 
Parent Conference NIghts.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

We conduct parent surveys for feedback every trimester.
