Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

It is the mission of the Queens College School for Math, Science, and Technology to ensure that our children learn by 
interacting with their environment, the natural and social world that surrounds them. Our school builds upon this 
interaction by creating confident learners who pose questions, explore problems, and communicate solutions in order 
to inspire our children to think broadly, critically, and creatively about their world and build connections among all 
areas of knowledge.

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The vibrancy and excitement of learning is evident throughout our Pre-k-8 public choice high performing 2014 Blue 
Ribbon Award school situated on the Queens College campus in Flushing, Queens. We have also been a Reward 
School for several consecutive years. Our ethnically and academically diverse student body, chosen through a blind 
lottery for Queens’ residents, love to attend school daily, as exhibited in our historically high attendance rates.  

A joint decision was reached between the New York City Department of Education and Queens College to establish 
our school in 1999 with a focus in math, science, and technology that would grow with two classes on each grade. As 
a barrier-free site, we provide a successful special education inclusion program in our general education classes. 

Our shared history of collaborative instruction with Queens College is celebrated by both organizations. The Interface 
Team of faculty, staff, and parents meets monthly to support research and co-teaching with professors and study new 
approaches and refine teaching practices, as well as preparing pre-service teachers for certification. In turn, our 
students participate in activities on the campus, extending the walls of our school.  

Our school received Reward Status from New York State for the past three years and made Adequate Yearly Progress 
every year since inception for all subgroups. We were identified as one of the top 25 schools in New York City for 
closing the achievement gap. Annually nearly 30% of our grade eight students receive offers to attend specialized high 
schools.  

Our parents, including those on the School Leadership Team and PTA, are integral members of the school community 
and are extremely involved and supportive. There is a true partnership among administration, staff, parents, and 
students who share a vision of high expectations to improve the performance of students at all levels. Each student 
receives individualized support and teachers work closely with families, keeping them apprised of their children’s 
achievements. Students are recognized monthly with a Principal’s Honor Roll Award, Academic Achievement, and the 
3Rs Award.  

The school’s core ideal to culture building centers around the belief that students need to play an active role in 
creating and supporting an environment where everyone feels included, safe, and engaged. Students facilitate 
activities each year, such as spirit days, a “no bullying” rally and pep rally for “Character Counts.” Each year students 
refine the school-wide behavior matrix that outlines the expected code of conduct which follows the school-wide 
model of the “3Rs,” be a Role model, be Responsible, be Respectful towards one another and staff. Citizenship and 
leadership skills are fostered and rewarded through the 3Rs, ARISTA, and Student Council. Service projects are 
developed and supported by ARISTA, the Middle School Cabinet, and the Student Council. 

It is our belief that all students have talents and natural abilities that should be fostered. Students participate in an 
interest-based, cross-graded school-wide enrichment program. We offer opportunities in the arts, math, science, 
literacy, and physical education. Our newest programs are debate, technology/computer science/coding, robotics, 
Chess, and creative science explorations. Our school mantra is to monitor, track, and assess our progress. We are 
supporting our school's and district's vision of building "Strong Roots" through ongoing inquiry to support and 
strengthen teaching and learning at 499.  

Our teachers prepare our students for their futures, providing strong roots in the humanities, science, math, and 
technology content. Returning students tell how well prepared they are for high school and how much they miss the 
nurturing and caring environment of 499. Our motto, “ It takes a team to educate a child, ” resonates throughout the 
building as our educators make it their ultimate goal to successfully guide our students through this part of their 
educational journey.

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

About 11% of our students have IEPs, and about 4% are ELLs. All of our students with IEPs receive SETTS services. We 
have two SETTS teachers and one ESL teacher.  

89% of our SWDs are performing below proficiency levels in ELA (levels 1 &2), and 79% of our SWDs are performing 
below proficiency levels in math.

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Curriculum and Instruction – Professional Development 

School leaders have a strategic, transparent system for managing professional development that supports teacher 
effectiveness and articulates clear expectations for teacher practice in alignment with professional goals. Our quality 
professional development program is a dynamic and fluid process that is ongoing, differentiated, and structured to 
improve teaching practice that we strongly believe will positively affect student achievement.  

Our professional development opportunities, developed in consultation with the Cabinet and Professional 
Development Committee, Queens College, and other educational partners, address school curricula and academic 
rigor, are connected to instruction and extend over time for planning, practice, coaching, and follow-ups. The 
principal will continue to provide learning opportunities for teachers through our partnership organizations (Queens 
College, Department of Education Borough Centers, Teachers College, Amplify, Generation Ready, and Thinking 
Maps). Offerings gleaned from an analysis of student achievement data are tied to instructional goals in core subjects 
and include a cohesive plan involving all students in the CCLS and the impact these expectations will have on adult 
learning needs. Our teachers actively participate in district level planning meetings to craft units of study aligned to 
the Next Generation Standards.  

Teacher team work and collaborative professional learning engages teachers to discuss their practice with peers, 
sharpen content expertise, visit colleagues’ classrooms and study student and teacher work so that intended 
improvements are apparent across classrooms. The school leaders participate in professional development in the 
following areas: Learning Partners, STEM , Computer Science for All, Algebra for All, and Thinking Maps, to further 
their own knowledge and effectiveness and share new learning with the entire school community.  

The support that the teachers receive allows them to expand their teaching practice and comes from a variety of 
sources both inside and outside the school – including Lead Teachers/Teacher Liaison in literacy, math, and special 
education. The long term plan is to support Common Core instructional shifts implementation across the school, assist 
with the setting of goals, and coaching into classrooms to strengthen practice. With this strong support team in place, 
the teachers are able to successfully try new strategies out in a lab site, receive immediate feedback, and then apply 
them in their classrooms. Teachers also engage in collaborative planning sessions, and create cross curricula STEM 
tasks to enhance student learning.  

Research and theory-driven collaborative teaching efforts exist with Queens College faculty. The school staff is 
actively involved with the Queens College field placement and teacher certification process in the elementary and 
secondary programs. Middle school teachers in ELA, Science, Mathematics and Foreign Language support the initial 
clinical learning experience for QC students as well as the student teaching experience. QC faculty supervises the

experiences. School leaders and staff effectively communicate expectations connected to a path to college and career 
readiness and successfully partner with families to support student progress toward those expectations. 

Our supportive parent body is involved in fund raising for the academic needs of our students. The parents volunteer 
and assume roles in the PTA and on the School Leadership Team. We encourage parent participation in school events, 
parent workshops, and classroom celebrations. To that end, our Parent Coordinator sends weekly email blasts to 
encourage parents to attend workshops and events and works with our guidance counselor to provide families with 
additional supports.  

Uniformed systems are in place to increase the academic communication to parents. A parent curriculum orientation 
is held in the evening in September for grades PreK-8, providing parents with the opportunity to not only meet the 
teacher, but to also learn from the teachers about curriculum and how to strengthen the home-school connection. 
Parent workshops, offered during school hours and in the evening, are conducted by our teachers, school leaders, and 
FSC Achievement Coaches. We offer workshops to parents about the ELA, Math, and Science Standards, transitioning 
to middle school, High School choice, career development, and cyber bullying. The monthly publications Home/School 
Connection are sent home from September through May. Academic progress and next learning steps are reported to 
parents through reading progress letters, math family letters, quarterly progress reports, Promotion-in-Doubt letters, 
standardized test scores, teacher contacts, and TeacherEase grading system. 

 

PS/IS 499Q is a collaborative partner with Queens College in promoting student achievement, parental involvement, 
and teacher professional growth. The administration works closely with the Queens College liaison, who also sits on 
our School Leadership Team, to promote a stronger interchange with the College to support student progress. 
Students are tutored by licensed NYC teachers enrolled in the QC graduate literacy program. The campus facilities are 
available for specific programs. Student interns from the physical education department support our fitness program 
and tennis instruction is provided for our students at a reasonable fee.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Based on 2017-2018 Math Instructional reports: 

  Average student proficiency for math in grade 3 is 79% 
  Average student proficiency for math in grade 4 is 77% 
  Average student proficiency for math in grade 5 is 67% 
  Average student proficiency for math in grade 6 is 70% 
  Average student proficiency for math in grade 7 is 81% 
  Average student proficiency for math in grade 8 is 69% (for those students who took the NYS Math 

Assessment) 

Even though about 70% of our students are proficient in math, only 58% of our students were placed in Algebra 
regents course work. All 58% of the students who were placed in Algebra class took and passed the Algebra regents.  

Principal Performance Review Feedback for 2017-2018 school year stated the following: 

  Continue to support your teachers in aligning teaching strategies that will more consistently provide access 

and engagement for all learners. (QR Indicator 1.2) 

  Continue to support teachers in the planning of higher order thinking questions.  
  Continue your work with teachers around the design of tasks to include extensions that will increase 
engagement and allow students to not just participate but also take ownership of their work-flows.  

Data from 2017-2018 School Quality Guide: 

  54% of the students say that they are challenged in class. (Which shows that 46% of the students do not feel 

challenged in class.) 

  47% of the students say that teachers ask difficult questions in class. (Which shows that 53% of the students 

feel that the teachers do not ask difficult questions in class.- shows lack of rigor)

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
By February 2019, a 5% increase in proficiency for mathematics will be evident based on the January benchmark 
assessment created by grade level teacher teams.  

Teachers will analyze pre and post assessment data for each unit of study in mathematics and share the trends with 
the school administrators. School administrators will analyze unit assessment data for grades 2-8 to monitor student 
progress. (October, February, and June) We expect to see 5% increase in proficiency at all grade levels.  

School administrators will schedule two meeting with each math teacher in grades 2-8, to monitor instructional 
practices and systems for data collection.  

Student progress for the regents class will be monitored 3 times throughout the year, using benchmark assessments. .  

The Instructional Cabinet will analyze school wide benchmark data in mathematics to assess and revise the 
instructional plan. Mid-year meeting is scheduled mid-February. 

Teacher level teams will also analyze student work and assessment data for grades 3-8 to monitor student progress 
and ensure that school is on track for meeting the goal of 5% increase in the number of students successfully 
participating and attaining proficiency on the NYS math regents. The impact of PD & instructional decisions; 
effectiveness of tasks and rubrics (Every 8-10 weeks) will be measured through impact on student performance.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

Based on the 2016-2017 School Environment Survey for 25Q499: 

-74% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that overall, their professional development experiences this year have 
included enough time to think carefully about, try, and evaluate new ideas. 

--65% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that overall, their professional development experiences this year have 
included opportunities to work productively with teachers from other schools.  

-78% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that they usually look forward to each working day at their school. 

-83% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that overall, their professional development experiences this year have 
included opportunities to work productively with colleagues in their school.  

-86% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that they are able to develop appropriate Individual Education Programs 
for their students with disabilities.  

 

Recommendations based on 2017-2018 Principal Performance Review Feedback: 

  Continue to model your expectations for teacher team work and ensure that systems are in place for teams 

and administrators to monitor the impact of inquiry work.  

  Gaps in teacher team work should be addressed to allow teachers to deepen their learning.  
 

It was evident that teachers need supports around analyzing and reconciling a variety of data streams in order 
to measure effectiveness of practice.  

  Teachers are struggling with a cohesive understanding of the purpose of inquiry and the impact it can have on 

improving student outcome.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.

weeks.  

Teachers will continue to engage in Professional Learning 
Communities (PLC) in cycles of learning. The weekly 80-minute 
professional development time will include PD and Bridge to 
Practice time. Bridge to Practice time will be utilized for teacher 
team work, using protocols, analyzing student data, studying 
research-based practices, resulting in shared improvements in 
teacher practice and mastery of goals for students.  

 

Teacher teams will meet regularly and bridge their learning to 
practice by refining the units of study. Teachers will create 
problem solving tasks (aligned to the Next Generation Standards) 
that provide differentiation/multiple entry points based on 
student needs.  

 

Teacher teams will focus on one of the following: 

  How are we crafting rigorous tasks that engage students 

in mathematical explorations and reasoning? 
  How do we utilize rigor matrix to define rigor? 
  How are we using tools and various representations to 

support thinking and problem solving?  

  How are we establishing classroom routines and 

instructional environment where mistakes are valued 
because they serve as a learning opportunity?  

  How do we engage in inquiry to create consistency and 

coherence of pedagogical practices?  

  How does the definition of rigor translate into practice? 

What does that look like in a classroom?

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

NYC School Quality Guide for 2017-2018 states the following: 

  Effective School Leadership score for Inclusive Leadership is 7% lower than the district average.  
  33% of the teachers say that they have influence over planning how discretionary funds are used. 
  27% of the teachers say that they have influence over hiring new professional personnel.  
  75% of the teachers say that the principal takes a personal interest in the professional development of 

teachers.  

Recommendations based on 2017-2018 Principal Performance Review Feedback: 

It is recommended that you support your teachers in planning of higher order questions.  

 
  Continue to work with teachers around the design of tasks to include extensions that will increase 

engagement and allow students to not just participate in but also take ownership of their knowledge.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, school leaders will create and implement a shared vision of learning, provide targeted professional 
development to teachers, and present parent workshops that are aligned to the school and district's goals. The impact 
of this work will be evidenced by a 5% increase of proficiency on the NYS ELA and math assessments, 25% decrease in 
the number of OORS infractions, and 5% increase in the Inclusive Leadership score on the School Quality Guide.  

School leaders will build "Strong Roots" by creating systems and structures to engage stakeholders in the development, 
monitoring, and refinement of "Shared Vision of Learning" in alignment to the district's vision; create systems and 
structures to provide targeted professional development to teachers; and provide parent workshops aligned to that 
shared vision.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS/IS499, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS/IS 499 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act  

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
    In addition to analyzing NYSITELL and NYSESLAT ELL data, we track the literacy skills of our ELLs using various reading and 
writing assessment tools throughout the year.   As a Teachers College Reading and Writing Project School, we use On Demand 
Writing assessments and TC Running Records to assess student reading and writing learning needs a minimum of four times a 
year.  Students performing below grade level are assessed more frequently.  Data monitoring the early literacy skills of our 
ELLs provides teachers with insight into student reading comprehension, phonics and decoding skills, as well as, writing, 
listening and speaking skills.  Teachers use this data to differentiate instruction through guided reading groups, strategy 
lessons and one-on-one conferences. Instruction is designed to meet ELLs at their learning level and helps them meet the 
NYS CCLS.  Instruction for expanding and transitioning ELLs is delivered using a co-teaching approach.  The ELL teacher plans 
and delivers instruction in collaboration with the classroom teacher using a stand-alone and integrated ENL model contingent 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

on the ELLs required number of service hours.  
    Currently, all nine of our Kgn. ELLs are approaching Kgn. standards in reading and writing.  The majority are reading pre-
emergent story books and using pictures and what they have learned from reading to write a story. Their NYSITELL levels vary 
with three ELLs identified as expanding, four as transitioning, and two as entering.  Even though all seven of our grade one 
ELLs are expanding on the NYSESLAT, their TC Assessment data identifies five ELLs as reading below grade level and one 
exceeding grade level.  Grade two student NYSESLAT data is more aligned to the TC Assessment data. Out of the four 
expanding grade two students on the NYSESLAT and one transitioning, three ELLs are a level 3 or four on TC Reading 
Assessments, one is a level two and one is a level one. One of the two grade five students is on grade level reading skills; the 
TC Reading level of the other one, who gets SETTS services, is P, which is the bottom three. His NYSESLAT data aligns with the 
TC Assessment. Our one Grade six student's reading level is S, and he scored expanding on the NYSESLAT. 
    Additionally, the ENL teacher has been using teacher-created formative assessments such as exit slips, juicy sentences, and 
written/oral responses to text-dependent questions, along with a culminating task at the end of the unit to guide instructional 
planning for our ELLs.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The ENL teacher meets with the classroom teachers to collect and analyze standard-based data collected from TC pro running 
record, NYSITELL, and NYSESLAT to modify the curriculum that best suits the needs of every student in the class. The ENL 
teacher and the classroom teachers will work collaboratively to create goals that are aligned using both general class rubric 
and NYSESLAT rubric along with differentiated checklists to track and monitor students academic growth and needs and plan 
accordingly.  
Additionally, because most of our ELLs are in grades K-2 (21 out of 31) our ENL teacher will work with our K-2 Teacher Team to 
track and monitor student data, review and revise curriculum to scaffold next steps for students.  Teacher team meets once a 
week.  A tool kit in Reading Comprehension for writing about reading will also be created by the ENL teacher to support the 
ELLs. 
Also, the ENL teacher has been implementing pedagogical approaches and strategies acquired from the 
Professional Development sessions such as the Mary Ann Cucchiara ENL sessions to enrich the learning for the ELLs. She will 
consistently plan and teach collaboratively with other classroom teachers, and turnkey her learning from Mary Ann 
Cucchiara ENL sessions with lower grades teachers in integrated ENL classrooms.     
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We evaluate the success of our ENL program by growth shown on school level assessments, and the increase in the percentage 
of ELLs that moved up one or more levels, as compared to the previous year. Additionally, we use summative and formative 
assessments, teacher observations, and report card grades. Curriculum goals and objectives are adapted and adjusted for 
student achievement in alignment with the New York Next Generation ELA Standards to improve the success of our 
program.  We have identified writing about reading as our high leverage area of student need that we are focused on.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The ENL teacher meets with the regular classroom teacher to review the continuous formative assessments to track students' 
progress and to set new learning goals. Also, she turnkeys a wide range of effective pedagogical approaches and strategies 
acquired from ENL Professional Developments sessions in subjects such as ELA and Science to appropriately differentiate 
content knowledge for individual learners with different language proficiency levels and distinctive needs.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
ELLs receive tiered RTI services at different times of the year based on various summative and formative assessments (i.e. TC 
reading and writing benchmarks, pre & post writing assessments) and teacher observations and feedback.   ALL RTI is delivered 
using an integrated ENL model and small group instruction aligned to the current curriculum.  ELL students with an IEP also 
receive RTI support based on data and student learning needs. Our school is focusing on writing about reading based on 
school-wide data trends.  We will provide ELLs identified as needing RTI scaffolds collaboratively developed by the 
SETSS teacher, ENL teacher and classroom teacher that focuses on "big Ideas". 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The NYSESLAT growth pattern from year to year is influenced by grade levels and date of admissions to our school.  Students 
who do well in all four testing modalities during their early years at 499 starting as kindergarten students begin to either 
plateau or show growth depending on their reading levels on TC Assessments.  Strong readers in grade two and above begin to 
test out on the NYSESLAT by grade 4 if not before. 
Also, Student-friendly peer/self assessment checklists created based on the five dimensions (Quality of Language, Coherence 
of Language, ) on NYSESLAT writing rubrics have been used by the ELLs for setting personal goals in writing about reading. On 
the flip side, all our long term ELLs have an IEP and are identified as needing SETSS and even though they show some progress 
they struggle to read and write on grade level on TC assessments and State exams.   
Overall, due to our small numbers, consistent population (lottery one time admission in September) and parent choice, our ELL 
program remains free standing.  Additionally, outcome assessment data is used to provide the ENL teacher targeted 
professional development (i.e., Mary Ann Cucchiara ENL sessions). 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

During weekly Teacher Teams/ Inquiry work, weekly co-teaching meetings/ planning time, the classroom teacher and ENL 
teacher share their data and work together with administration to develop next steps for ELLs, inter-visitations, and 
professional development for teachers. 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Students are heterogeneously grouped according to grade level. The majority of students fall under either 
transitional, expanding or commanding and are served their mandated hours using an integrated co-teaching 
model.  A certified ENL teachers co-teaches with a content area teacher using parallel teaching and small group 
instruction to support ELLs.  The ENL teacher co-teaches during ELA in grades K-5 and co-teaches during social studies 
in grade 6. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Not applicable. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Not applicable. 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

        All ELLs in our school receive the NYS mandated number of hours for acquiring English language skills by a certified ENL 
teacher.    Entering and Emerging students receive 360 minutes per week, 180 minutes using specific ENL 
methodologies.  Transitioning and Expanding level students receive 180 minutes per week of ELA and ENL 
integrated instruction.  Our only grade 6 ELL has been grouped heterogeneously with 2 Commanding students, and receives 
180 minutes per week of SS and ENL integrated instruction.  Commanding students will continue to receive 90 minutes of 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

instruction per week for two years. Scheduling and mandated hours are tracked by STARS, which ensures all students are 
receiving their mandated service hours.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   ELA, social studies and other content areas are delivered in English in a co-teaching (for TR, EX & CM ELLS) and pull out small 
group setting during the school day.  Differentiated instruction is delivered to all ELLs through various methods and 
approaches, to make content comprehensible and enrich language development.  Objectives are clearly defined and designed 
to meet the demands of the NYS Next Generation Standards.  Students are provided with opportunities for meaningful 
discussions around content and skills, vocabulary is pre-taught, and concepts are made clear through modeling, gestures, 
visuals, etc.  Scaffolding techniques and critical thinking questions are used throughout all lessons.  Children work actively in a 
student-centered environment. Newcomer students are taught basic social and academic language skills.  If possible, the 
native language is used to clarify any confusion.  Students are also paired with reading partners who speak their native 
language.  Bilingual dictionaries and glossaries, bilingual paraprofessionals and native language materials are used.  The review 
and assessment of student comprehension and learning is ongoing.  Students are given preparatory instruction throughout the 
school year for both the NYSESLAT and the ELA.  Specific strategies are targeted based on students' previous performance on 
the reading and writing sections of the NYSESLAT. 
Core content ELA instruction is delivered using the TC Readers and Writers workshop model.  Students are taught strategies 
based on their individual reading and writing needs.    Social studies core content is taught using "big ideas and themes", 
collaborative student group work through questing and discussions. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

  Students are not evaluated in another language aside from the Spanish LAB when a Spanish speaking student is first identified 
as an ELL. At present, our ENL program only evaluate students in English and there are no formal evaluations in any other 
native languages. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Instruction for ELLs is differentiated for all subgroups.  The differentiated instruction delivered to all students is aligned with 
New York State English Language Arts Next Generation Learning Standards.  Presently, there are no SIFE students enrolled, 
however our instructional plan for SIFE students includes the following: A supportive environment for the students will be 
provided with a bilingual staff, ENL teachers using specific methods to help SIFEs reach academic success, a buddy system with 
classmates, and parent coordinator support for both students and parents in the school.  Sheltered instruction in the form of 
an increased use of visuals and collaborative learning opportunities will be implemented.  Thematic curricula and individual 
learning plans, as well as an adapted curriculum will be used to cover most relevant information that is accessible and age-
appropriate.  Explicit instruction will be given in the basic reading components: phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, 
vocabulary and text comprehension.  Finally, students will have access to a literacy-rich environment.   
Regarding newcomers, a similar plan is put in place. A print-rich environment is provided for students.  Word associations and 
Thinking Maps are used to activate prior knowledge.  Students are engaged in hands-on learning through role-play, arts, and 
SMARTboard activities.  New vocabulary is analyzed in context and definitions are explained and rephrased.  Explicit 
instruction in the basic reading components is given, and students work in collaborative discussion groups to develop and 
practice social skills.  In addition, students are given a tour of the school so they can locate important places, and they are 
taught the names of important people.  Specific school routines and behavior expectations are reviewed.  The child's home 
language is used, when necessary.   
For ELLs receiving services between 4-6 years, small group instruction is provided to target their specific needs. Previous 
testing data is used to determine their academic needs, and to teach them strategies and skills to improve their academic 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

performance.  Picture cards and picture dictionaries provide additional support.  Students are guided in editing and publishing 
final pieces in writing and research.  They are encouraged to use computer and Internet programs that are designed to 
increase vocabulary and improve grammar. 
Regarding long-term ELLs, a focus on literacy development across content areas is key.  Explicit vocabulary instruction, 
sentence analysis and scaffolding activities would be used.  Teachers would collaborate on lesson planning aligned to students' 
needs.   
Former ELL students receive 2 periods of ENL instruction per week for two years after reaching proficiency on the NYSESLAT.  If 
students are not successful in class, transitional support is offered based on individual needs.  This support may be limited to 
specific content areas as needed.  Test modifications are provided for former ELLs for up to two years after achieving 
proficiency on the NYSESLAT. 
 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
We have three ELLs identified as having special needs who receive small group instruction provided by means of parallel, 
alternative and station teaching models.  In some classes, students are assisted by bilingual paraprofessionals.  Students are 
supported with anticipatory strategies such as front-loading vocabulary and previewing texts to access background 
knowledge. Other scaffolding strategies included differentiated graphic organizers (Thinking Maps), sentence frames, and 
guide cards to help students focus. In addition, picture dictionaries and books in the native language are available for 
them.  Collaborative student discussions are facilitated with the use of conversational prompts to improve comprehension, as 
well as speaking and listening skills. ELLs will also get access to Writing about Reading tool-kit for reference.   In addition, the 
ENL teacher co-teaches with the K-5 ELA teachers using the Teachers College Reading and Writing workshop model to teach 
guided reading and writing strategies based on student conferencing and assessment results.   The ENL teacher co-
teaches with the grade six social studies teacher using the K-8 Passport to Social Studies.  Using the strategies listed above the 
focus teaching is around writing about reading. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
In order to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs within the least restrictive environment, the ENL teacher provides the 
mandated number of minutes using an integrated co-teaching approach, as does the SETSS teacher. The ENL teacher and 
common branch teachers collaborate to ensure a cohesive and effective instructional planning that are aligned with the Next 
Generation Learning Standards. All teachers collaborate to ensure cohesiveness and effective instructional planning for 
our ELL-SWDs, in order to achieve their IEP goals and achieve English language fluency.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Our school offers a range of intervention services in the areas of ELA, math and other content areas.  Classroom teachers use 
tier 1 interventions plans to support students through differentiated instruction and research based modifications from the 
Pre-Referral Intervention Manual.  Interventions are designed to teach meta-cognitive skills, provide multiple entry points, and 
are in cycles continuously reassessed for effectiveness.   All interventions are offered in English but the native language is used 
whenever possible to make content more comprehensible.  TC reading assessments are used to progress monitor and drive 
ELA strategy lessons supporting targeted ELLs.   Additionally, teachers also provide pre and post assessments in all content 
areas to measure student growth and design lessons which target student needs.   See #6   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

The nature of the ENL program has been changed from a pull-out model to a push-in model, to provide continuity in the 
classroom. Both teachers work together in a team-teaching model to provide differentiated instruction and multiple entry 
points for all students. Based on the current data, we will continue to provide students services using the pull-out / push-in 
models as per their required number of service hours. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

Not applicable. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All children are represented equally and can fully participate in any and all activities in our school community. Currently, ELLs 
can participate in extra-curricular activities such as, BOKS, CHAMPS, enrichment, Music, middle school after school program, 
and academic test prep, etc.  Our music teacher teaches content areas through music and movement.  Students learn 
vocabulary, cultural differences and similarities.  All notices regarding curricular and extra-curricular programs are provided in 
English and the home language.   All students have access to technology using class computers, Google Classroom, iPads, 
Media Research class, and weekly technology lab classes. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Picture dictionaries, books on tape, interactive smartboard lessons, and picture cards are used to support ELLs in the 
classroom.  Internet access is available for educational websites like Brainpop, designed to increase vocabulary and improve 
grammar.  Interactive SMARTboard activities from websites such as PBS Learning are used to support English proficiency of 
visual, audio, and kinesthetic learners.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language support is delivered to the students through bilingual paraprofessionals, bilingual picture dictionaries,  Internet 
translation services, and books in the native language.  Any teacher working with ELLs who speaks the native language may 
also deliver instruction in that language in a small group setting.  Additionally, a peer who speaks the same language may 
provide support by translating instruction and/or assignments. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All required services support ELLs' ages and grade levels in line with the curriculum, at their English proficiency 
level.  Resources are age-appropriate and accessible to all grade levels.  Home/ School connection is used to meet with parents 
and ensure the school has all the proper biographical information on each of our students so that we can best meet their 
individual needs. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We share our building with a D75 school, PS 993.  Both schools use the building very differently and we service very different 
populations.   In general, our students/ ELLs have limited contact with the D75 students.   However, some of our classes do 
have PS 993 inclusion students. Our partnership with PS 993 allows us to teach all our students about diversity, compassion 
and recognizing each others differences. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
New student orientation for all parents and students is provided before the beginning of the school year in August. 
Kindergarten orientation takes place in early September. For Kindergarten students who are newly enrolled before the 
beginning of the school year, a packet is provided encouraging the parents to work with their children on basic skills that they 
will need in school.  Separation workshops are also provided by the guidance counselor, to help students adjust to their new 
environment. Parents are encouraged to contact the parent coordinator with any questions or concerns that arise. The ENL 
teacher can assist in communication with Chinese-speaking parents.   Our school is a lottery school with a one time admission 
start date in September.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish is offered in middle school grades at PS/IS 499. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Not applicable. 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
All personnel servicing ELLs participate in appropriate ELL related professional development offered by the borough offices, 
Central, superintendent's support team, and/ or outside/ in-house ELL experts.  The professional development is meant to 
build expertise around working with ELLs or with ELL related issues.  It enhances our school's ability to effectively identify ELLs; 
provide physical, social and emotional growth specific to ELL needs; grow ELL parent/ school communication; expand 
knowledge of the language acquisition process for all staff members, etc.  Teachers attend grade and faculty conferences 
devoted to differentiated learning and inquiry work around targeted ELL populations.  Bi-monthly grade conferences are held, 
as well as weekly PD and inquiry meetings.  In addition, ELL personnel are given opportunities throughout the year to attend 
outside professional development highlighting specific, research-based strategies to use with ELL students. 
ENL teachers attend OELL PD opportunities, during which they share and exchange best instructional practices with 
colleagues.  Additionally, ENL teachers participate in webinars related to instructional shifts of the CCLS as they pertain to 
ELLs.  All teachers are receiving professional development around expanding the use of technology to service all students, 
including ELLs, using programs such as Google Classroom.  Teachers are also working on improving ways to teach students to 
write about reading. 
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
All staff members at PS/ IS 499 have received their mandated Jose P. training,  Our teachers are experienced, certified teachers 
who have received the mandated ENL requirement of 15% of total hours.  Teachers  receive training in best practices for co-
teaching strategies, and integrating language and content instruction for English Language Learners.  In cycles, Queens College 
professors work with content area teachers to collaborate with service providers such as SETSS and ENL teachers. ENL teachers 
receive a minimum of 50% professional development which focuses on language acquisition in alignment with core content 
area instruction.  An agenda maintains records of teachers meeting the required training.  Teachers document their weekly 
professional development activities on the PD Evaluation Form, which is submitted to the Principal. New teachers receive 
mentors who assist in this training.  All teachers collaborate during inquiry work to discuss strategies that would best assist ELL 
students.ENL teacher participates in all district wide, borough wide, and city wide professional developments designed for 
servicing ELLs.   
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70 

 

 

 

Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
We begin the school year for all our ELL parent in the same way.  The ENL teacher reaches out to all our ELL parents to discuss 
parent choice, continued entitlement, student program placement, assessment results, Next Generation Standards, programs 
used to teach the content area, etc.  Additionally, during Parent Engagement Tuesdays, Parent Nights, Parent-teacher 
conferences, parents and teachers discuss students' progress, goals, and students' academic needs to better support them.    

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parents of ELLs are invited to all school parent events such as; classroom celebrations showcasing student units of study and 
student projects, Parent Night, OEM Preparedness Presentations, Traffic Safety Presentations, Family Feast,  STEAM Night, 
monthly Coffee and Conversations with the Principal. Science Fair, Lincoln Center Family Engagement Events at LC, Music and 
Art Festival, Fitness Night etc.  In addition, the ENL teacher reaches out weekly to our ELL parents during Tuesday's Parent 
Engagement time.  At this time the ENL teachers shares curriculum information, student progress, strategies to support ELLs at 
home etc.  
 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Simi Minhas, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Information on translation needs are gathered from the following: 

1. At registration, parents are interviewed and asked what language they would preferred to use when 
communicating with the school (i.e. spoken or written) 

2. Blue Card- parents state language preference for home-school communication and information is put into ATS 

3. RHLA- ATS report showing the school's home language data gathered from the HLIS form at registration 

4. RAPL- ATS report showing the language preference of parents based on information from the blue cards.

Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

The entire staff is notified of the A-663 regulations requiring schools communicate with families in their primary 
language. The Parent Coordinator is identified as the Language Access Person who can provide assistance with 
communicating with parents in their primary language. In addition, the entire staff is provided with a copy of the CR 
A-663, the Language Access Handbook for Schools, and the Principal's Desk Aid.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

The school will determine the primary language of a household using the HLIS, the blue card, and teacher feedback. 
The school will provide all family households with translated documents for centrally produced communications and 
student specific critical documents. Parents will be notified of their rights for language assistance with a copy of the 
Bill of Rights and Responsibilities in their primary language, if it is a covered language. The Administration, Parent 
Coordinator, classroom teacher and school personnel in the main office will ensure in-house interpretation and 
translation services are provided when required as per the Chancellor’s Regulations A-663. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

We conduct formal and informal parent surveys to assess the quality and availability of parent communication and 
services to non English speaking parents. The surveys are conducted in varying preferred languages asking the parents 
about the supports they may need around instruction, curriculum, student progress, assessments, safety, health, 
community services, etc.
