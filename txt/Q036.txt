Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our vision continues to be to prepare our scholars to meet the higher academic standards of achievement for success. 
P.S. 36 prepares our scholars to be future leaders. We want our scholars to be socially conscious citizens of their 
community and the world. The scholars are involved in various efforts to support their education and we as educators 
thrive to be multifaceted in our approaches to meet the intellectual, physical, emotional, social, linguistic challenges 
of our scholars. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
In the 2018-2019 school year, P.S.36Q intends to continue growing as a school community. We will build strong family 
and community ties as we provide a comprehensive education to our scholars. In order to ensure success a 
partnership has been formed with the school, parents, community organizations and civic groups. Performance 
standards will be achieved and exceeded in grades K-5. We plan to meet the needs of all of our students at risk, on 
and above grade level, talented and gifted, newly arrived and special education through an interdisciplinary approach 
to curriculum and standards driven instruction. Through enhancement of our instructional strategies and enrichment 
activities, Our scholars are presented with a variety of rigorous tasks to help make them college and career ready. 

P.S 36Q is a collaborative community school that embraces scholars, staff and families. We strive for “Excellence for 
All”. We view ourselves as lifelong learners on a pursuit of excellence. Our daily mission is to make sure all scholars 
are safe and receive an exemplary sound education. Our intent is to nurture the whole child. We thrive on providing 
our scholars with a vast variety of experiences connected to learning. Everyone is a stakeholder at P.S.36Q and we 
strive to build scholars who are smart, responsible, respectful, strong and lifelong learners. This is echoed in our daily 
affirmation that the scholars repeat. P.S.36Q, The St. Albans School "The Jewel of St. Albans" is located in the St. 
Albans section of Queens, New York. The school community is comprised of single home families, multi-dwelling 
homes, extended families, foster families, traditional families and grandparents raising scholars. The school has a 
transient population where we register and discharge scholars throughout the year. We provide workshops for 
parents and we will be continuing the seasonal conversation sessions with our parents. We host monthly open houses 
for parents to come in and visit. Our goal is to enhance scholar achievement through parental supports and 
partnerships. 

P.S.36 is a very diverse school. There are many cultures that merge to make up the fabric of the school. It is a 
kaleidoscope of teaching and learning. Parents are vital to the success of the school and the scholars. The current 
level of parental involvement continues to grow. The strength of the school is its culture. The community has been 
involved and we have a variety of community partners that continue to be involved. The PTA has become a vital 
partner in informing parents and keeping an academic focus on the things they do. . We do a salute to student of the 
month and that brings out some parents. This year we will incorporate student performances to help bring parents 
out and increase parent participation. The SLT has sat down and decided to go full speed ahead and do some more 
outreach, parallel some activities and offer other types of incentives (babysitting, food, raffle gifts, etc). We will 
continue to promote social events and have an instructional twist to it. There have been family S.T.E.A.M. events in 
the fall and spring and family paint night. Our process for reporting is by the attendance sheets from PTA workshops, 
meeting and activities, Parent Coordinator logs, attendance and volunteer lists are also helpful in tracking parent 
participation.  

We have 18 classes comprised of 2 Kindergarten (1 GE, 1 ICT), 3 First Grade (2 GE, 1 ICT, ), 2 Second Grade (1 GE, 1 
ICT), 2 Third Grade (1 GE, 1 ICT,), 3 Fourth Grade(2 GE, 1 ICT) and 3 Fifth Grade (2 GE, 1 ICT 1 ). SPED classes: 1 (K/1) 
1(2/3) and 1 (4/5). The average number of students is 25-30 students in each GE and ICT class and 12 in each SPED 
Class. We have a variety of support staff such as paraprofessionals, psychologist, social worker, family worker, 
guidance counselor, volunteers, speech, ESL and resource room teachers, Technology, Adapted Physical Education, 
Physical Education, Literacy/Art and Science/Mathematics Teacher to support our students. Our students continue to 
make progress as shown by our most recent cut scores for ELA and Mathematics. We have less scholars who had to 
attend summer school this year. 

Our teaching population is very diverse as it relates to teaching experience. We have first year teachers to 25 year 
teachers. We provide professional development and the teachers have taken ownership of their learning. The 
professional development team is integral in the planning of school-wide professional development. They meet 
regularly to discuss next steps, they enlist other staff members with expertise and they assist with the monthly 
professional development plan. We have teacher teams that meet weekly to discuss student work and achievement. 
They analyze, identify progress, strengths and weakness, best practice strategies and next steps.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

The scholars are involved in many activities to develop as solid citizens through consciousness. We aim for all students 
to be experts at something. Our instructional programs have been enhanced with a variety of supports that can be 
used at home such as MobyMax for both reading and math and a variety of website supports. In grades K-5 we do 
guided reading and guided math. We will continue to use the teacher's college reading and writing program to 
enhance ELA in the school. In mathematics we use the Go Math program in grades K-1 with EngageNY as a support. In 
grades 2-5 the teachers will use performance task in their guided math practices. Science and Social Studies is 
embedded in the ELA programs as well as the Engineering is Elementary program and EngageNY bundles. In grades K-
5 we will use the Passport Social Studies program. Some grades used the thematic units they developed for the 
Department of Education Common Core Library. The Wilson Fundations program is used in grades K-2 and in the 
Special Education classes. Our writing philosophy is grounded in the Teacher’s College Writers Workshop Model. Our 
school is unique as we are very hands on. We have the Jamaica Read volunteers that help read one on one with 
identified 1 st graders. We have monthly school-wide topics such as book of the month, character of the month, spirit 
day and college and career activity of the month. This year we will infuse the arts and do a study of an artist a month. 
This has helped to keep us focused on a universal theme. We do morning exercises with a word of the week and a 
positive affirmation that the scholars recite.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our SPED population is very unique. The teachers collaborate to ensure we are meeting the needs of the scholars we 
serve. There are 3 self contained classes (191-K/1, 391-2/3 and 591-4/5) and 6 ICT classes (K, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5th grade 
classes. The teachers meet regularly to discuss new strategies and the IEP teacher does professional development 
monthly to help cement our practice. Administrators meet with the teachers to discuss where the scholars are and 
how to better help them succeed. We also have other scholars who receive related speech services such as physical 
therapy, occupational therapy, adapted physical education, counseling and speech. our SPED populations need more 
direct repetitive learning strategies to reinforce the instruction. We use a lot of hands on and technology strategies to 
enhance learning. Our ELL population is also very unique and we have over 25 scholars who speak spanish, creole, 
bangledesh, urdu and french. They are currently using an enhance computer program as we are monitoring their 
learning more frequently with this program. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

As a school our 2018-2019 Framework for Great Schools developing rigorous instructional practices focus is for work 
on driving instruction, levelling supports and assessment. We want to learn to know our scholars and use this as a 
starting point for planning to be able to: 

● Demonstrate academic and personal growth of the scholars (Rigorous Instruction) 

● To be able to clearly articulate the scholars development and how they are progressing as an individual learner and 
member of the community to be able to coordinate support services and resources. (Supportive Environments, 
Collaborative Teachers and Strong Family Community Ties) 

● Employ systems and structures to help in the development of the scholars. (Rigorous Instruction, Collaborative 
Teachers, Effective School Leadership and Supportive Environments) 

Our teachers have gotten stronger with getting to know the whole child and diagnosing learning through what they 
know. 

We have employed more heart to heart conversations with parents to support interventions. 

we have used data to help us plan and provide resources and services to support teaching and learning.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
After looking at data (cut scores from the state assessments, running records, baseline assessment, teacher team 
notes, Quality Review results, informal assessments, conference notes, reviewing materials and conversations with 
pedagogy, it was decided that we needed to look at Mathematics and ELA.  

● We will expand our concentration on mathematics in the 2018-19 school year as well as focus on improving in ELA. 
We saw a small difference in the number of scholars who met the cut scores on the 2017 and 2018 state assessments. 
In grades 3 & 5 there was a increase in scholars who did not meet in mathematics. The teachers will keep unit tracking 
sheets on each scholar and we can monitor scholars progress. We will analyze the 2018 math and ELA assessments 
and look at the item skills analysis to see where we need to focus. We will do workshops on the practice of teaching..  

● We worked hard in learning how to do guided reading and through scheduling we ensured our teachers saw each 
guided reading group 3-4 times a week. We do running record 4x a year. We will continue that practice.  

● We were able to track scholar reading levels and there was an increase across the school. There is a need to be 
more focused with our guided reading practices. 

● Our scholars were engaged in small group instruction, did more presenting of their materials, increased articulation 
and teachers assessed more to ensure we would drive the instruction. Our scholars become more confident and this 
was observed in the quality of projects and the presentation. 

● We will continue these practices for the 2018-2019 school year and observe the growth over 2 years., 

We will look at the beginning, mid year and year end assessments in Go Math for grades K-1. We will look at the 
standards checklist tracking sheets for math for grades 2-5. Teachers will monitor scholar progress through those 
vessels.. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 

By June 2019 the school community will focus on strengthening mathematics practices in classrooms by analyzing 
monthly math data and tracking scholar progress on the CCLS mathematics standards as measured by scholar 
improvements in mathematics on the final assessments and NY State mathematics assessments. ,

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

● Curriculum planning teams will refine, revise and align current 
curriculum maps to include more Social Studies and Science 
lessons to support the school-wide STEM initiative. 
Implementation of the passport social studies program. We will 
incorporate more writing activities to immerse our scholars in 
writing in the content area. 

● Google docs will be used as a universal system for teachers to 
make continuous updates and revisions of the lessons that can 
be shared across the school 

Our SWD and ELL scholars are immersed in small group 
instruction to support their learning. We have homogeneous 
groups and level groups to address specific needs of the sub 
groups. Tailored and direction instruction is fostered with those 
scholars.. 

● Teachers will meet in teacher teams, common preps and grade 
conferences to discuss monthly events, concepts and connect 
them to their curriculum to support extended scholar learning 
and exposure. Professional development will be ongoing in both 
Math and mathematics. We will focus strongly on organizing 
scholar work and use various sources to teach. 

● Teachers will develop common rubrics, benchmarks, grade 
assessments, analyze and provide next steps for their scholars. 
Teacher teams will use the cycles of learning protocol to 
monitor, analyze and provide direct instruction for writing 
improvement.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
● Walk-throughs are done weekly with a specific focus ex: homework, notebooks, questioning, etc., Observations 
(monthly-ongoing), ADVANCE ratings, TC running records(4x a year), assessments-units, beginning , middle and final, 
report cards (3x a year), progress reports (January) portfolios (monthly), data from Moby Max, Classdojo, teacher 
conversations, observations of scholars and on demand writing analysis (4x a year).. 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January 
Regents, etc.) 
Data from running records, exit tickets, rubrics, teacher comments will be used to monitor scholar success. Tracking 
sheets are used with Go Math units and running records and they are monitored more frequently. The on-demand 
writing submissions are four times a year and they are reviewed by the teacher first, discussed in teacher team to 
determine the commonalities, then the administrator of the grade reviews and teaching strategies are developed for 
improvement. The use of conference notes, lesson plans and writing samples support what steps need to be taken for 
improvement. Teachers use a check off list as scholars master the various standards. This is additional data that is 
used to drive instruction. In February 2018 our scholars growth will be measured based on how many levels of 
mastery on the writing checklist they have made. We anticipate 20% of the scholars have met the goal. 

 
Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
We aim to provide a safe and sound nurturing environment for our students and their families. This environment is 
built on trust and transparency. After reviewing the most recent School Quality Snapshot, NYC School Survey and 
Quality Review it is determined that we need to improve in our communication to parents.  

● We have good systems in place such as a monthly newsletter, posters around the building and at all entrances, 
weekly telephone messenger, email blast, notices, personal telephone calls, conference times, open classrooms, open 
door policy, workshops, parent events, classdojo, and teacher conversations. Although our rating was high we are not 
seeing the results in student achievement. Parents indicate we communicate. There is a disconnect and our goal is to 
bombard parents with information, training and provide more workshops for parents to learn. One of the new 
additions we added is to use technology. Most of our programs can be accessed via telephones which make it easier 
for parents. We have a lot of partnerships that help to support our school-wide focus. We will continue to provide our 
parents with resources, support to be involved in every aspect of their child's academic journey. 

 

 

As we promote college and careers through our monthly school-wide activities we also provide supports to our 
parents via emails of job posting and job fairs. If our parents are employed and productive then it enhances and 
strengthens the family. 

Our ultimate goal is to provide resources and supports to families as we encourage trust and community partnerships. 
We provide respect and transparency in our daily practices. 

We want to foster good relationships between teacher and child, developing a strong home school support. 
We want to enhance scholar academics with parent involvement on the instructional level 
We want to increase parent participation at events, in school volunteering and at Parent Tuesdays 
We want parents to be more knowledgeable about how they can help to make their scholar successful 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.

By June 2019, the school will strengthen the social and emotional development of P.S.36Q, scholars and parents by 
providing supports, incentives and ongoing strategies to help our scholars cope and excel academically as measured 
by a decrease in aggressive behavior, a decrease in incidents in our school and an increase in scholar leaders as 
measured by the decrease in OORS reports.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

For the 2018-2019 school year, we will implement several new things and continue with some existing best practices 
such as:  

● Collaborative teacher teams are in place at P.S. 36 and will continue with using the cycles of learning protocols. 

● Preparation schedules have been devised where teachers have multiple common preps throughout the week. This 
gives teachers opportunities to meet on the grade, across grades and disciplines. Each teacher services all classes one 
time a week. 

● Teacher teams have an embedded time on Tuesdays for 40 minutes to engage in inquiry-based activities. They are 
analyzing data and adjusting instruction. 

● Curriculum maps are done using Goggle docs online program. They serve as a living document and changes and 
adjustments are made as needed. The transparency gives all teachers insight on the content taught on the grades 
above and below their own.  

● Daily monitoring of teacher teams was an area needing improvements based on the last Quality Review. We made 
some changes and monitored it more closely. Teacher team meetings are monitored by the supervisor for the grade. 
This process gives teachers timely feedback and next steps. We use a teacher team protocol sheet for monitoring 
purposes of the weekly meeting and the Administrator of that grade sits in periodically and helps to guide the 
discussion based on the feedback sheets. We are digging deeper into our data and having more prescribe discussions 
about scholars and instruction. We made some changes and monitored it closely but there is a need for more. We will 
firm up the cycles of learning and have more in depth discussions around scholar work.  

As a school, data analysis has improved. It was a weak area that is being addressed. We are dedicating 2017-2018 to 
developing solid plans of action using the data to drive instruction. We have a data cycle schedule that we will adhere 
to to keep us on track.  

The school is working on improving analyzing various data sources and classroom performance assessments to make 
better instructional decisions to close the achievement gap. Teachers are more engaged in plan more purposefully. 

● We will continue to use exemplars and task performance examples as we work with our scholars to become more 
articulate and explain their work. We will have scholars validate and defend their answers. 

School support staff meets together with the classroom teachers to articulate on students that receive services to 
ensure the coordination of services do not overlap. Support teams meet with the school administration to keep 
informed of students that are being evaluated in the school and next steps. Everyone is involved.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          23 

 

PS 36 staff will do a survey needs assessment in September to determine what workshop topics best serve our 
teachers. We issued that survey in June to help us get a kick start on our planning.  

A Professional Development team comprised of highly effective and effective teachers from the grades will guide the 
work.. The function of the team is to plan, evaluate and facilitate workshops for colleagues based on the topics from 
the survey suggestions. Workshops will occur weekly for 80 minutes and best practice teachers are sometimes asked 
to present.  

The school is working on refining our needs assessment to include opportunities for improvement regarding students 
who scored level of 3s and 4s on NY State ELA/Math Exams.  

● Discussions with teachers at grade level meetings (50 minutes, 2x month), feedback from members of the 
Leadership Team, discussions at meetings, Administrative Cabinet Meetings and input from AP Data Specialist has 
resulted in a the development of the PI Academy which works in homogeneous groups.  

● We used the beginning of year Benchmark Performance Tasks administered by classroom teachers and the state 
exams to identify those students.  

P.S. 36 continues to strengthen building capacity with effective systems for monitoring teaching practices to create 
differentiated professional support to increase student outcomes.  

● The ADVANCE system has helped to monitor areas of weakness and need for teachers and we address that through 
inter-visitations, videos, modelling and planning. This year we did not have any developing or ineffective teachers as 
rated by the ADVANCE system. 

● Ongoing needs assessments include opportunities for teachers to improve their planning and systemically gather 
any data needed to accurately reflect teaching practices. Informal inter-class visitations to share best practices and 
incorporate new instructional strategies to improve teacher and student growth.  

● Teachers use Math benchmark assessments and performance tasks given at the beginning of the year to identify 
students who need additional support as well as running records levels. Types of support are determined by working 
collaboratively on grade teams, in consultation with the Speech teachers and administrators.  

● Students who need additional support are provided with small group work with classroom teachers and learning 
specialists. We have bi-weekly meetings on the progress of students to modify instructional supports.  

● After analyzing the 2017 New York State Exams and Benchmark Performance Tasks we recognized we need to build 
capacity by improving instruction and teacher effectiveness. Looking at student performance and progress on the 
school quality snapshot report indicate there is a need in developing teacher capacity and instruction to support ELA 
and Mathematics. This goal has evolved from the need to ensure teachers are immersed in the Citywide Instructional 
Expectations and Framework for Teaching to improve instruction.  

● Teacher effectiveness in the classroom practices is guided by working with our support staff and administrators on a 
monthly basis in this area. 

 

● We have decided to do a longitudinal study on reading and writing in the building and we will utilize our training. 

We will look at the GO Math mid year assessment, running records, I-Ready mid year assessments and student work 
to determine growth and gaps. We observed some trends and need to shore up those gaps with more direct 
instruction and skills based lessons.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Analyzing the current school climate and results from the Principal’s Performance Observation , Quality Review, 
school report cards, school surveys, parent and teacher comment documents the school needs to improve in 1.2 and 
2.2 Quality Review indicators. We are addressing the needs by: 

● Continuing to analyze scholar work during teacher team and improve the level of assessment to make sure it is 
aligned and challenging. The teacher team has to get stronger with developing plans to address the gaps. Instruction 
has to reflect skills based action. 

● The teachers have provided different entry points and provided more activities to engage the scholars. We made 
some curriculum changes that provide more beginning, middle and final assessments to monitor scholar progress. 

● Structures have been implemented in the school to improve instructional outcomes. The school continues to embed 
the ELA/Math shifts in instruction. Guided reading instruction is part of the daily schedule to target literacy skills in a 
small group environment.  

● In ELA, an area of weakness is reading informational text, word attack skills and incorporating textual evidence 
within written responses. Students are engaged in differentiated instruction, cooperative flexible learning 
opportunities where they are leading discussions, questioning their peers thinking and justifying opinions using 
textual evidence. As a result, students are questioning their peers when their peer assess. They assist in the creation 
of rubrics that are used to assess their work. Students are reading more complex text closely. Teachers construct high-
level thinking questions, explicitly model and scaffold instruction.  

● Teachers are engaged in collaborative inquiry by analyzing student work to identify trends, strengths and 
weaknesses in the class and across grades. We will look at gaps and tailor instruction to close the gaps. 

● Teachers will use Goggle docs to create their curriculum maps and refine them as needed. This affords us an 
opportunity to be transparent across the school. 

 

Based on the most recent school quality review snapshot, the NYS ELA/math Test the area in need of improvement is 
mathematics. In 3rd grade 31% of students met NYS standard in 2018 which was a 7% increase from 2017. In 4th 
grade 18% of students met the NYS standard in Math with a 5% increase. In the 5th grade, 13% met the NYS Standard 
in math a 7% decrease from 2018. On the fall baseline assessment Math was a weak area of the school and it requires 
us to make some adjustments. The preliminary item analysis on grades 3-5 ELA and Math indicate we need to focus 
on mathematics. We invested in Go Math 4 years ago and although we are seeing growth in the unit assessments, 
beginning, middle and final assessments we are not making significant growth on the state assessments. We will

employ more direct instruction strategies and small group instruction to help close the gaps. We notice that parents 
are struggling with the homework from Go math and we decided to focus on looking at the lessons. Perhaps the 
teachers need some more professional development to help them provide instruction. The standards of weakness in 
K-2 is Number-Base Ten and in 3-5 Number/Operations-Fractions and Measurement/Data. We will analyze the 2017 
state assessments and refine our goals based on the results. 

● We will continue to provide challenging exemplar tasks to our scholars. 

● PS 36 staff is focused on ensuring that the whole-child is being supported in our school community, not just 
academically but social and emotionally. Students receive the needed services from the support staff such as speech, 
occupational/physical therapy, adaptive physical education and counseling.  

● Teachers will identify 5 students in their classroom that they will closely monitor to give them the additional 
support they may need. This is done through attendance monitoring, keeping in daily communication with parents 
with classdojo or being a mentor for the child.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
 

By June 2019, the school administrators and professional development team will develop a comprehensive professional 
development plan that builds capacity in checking for understanding using the AOL protocol to enhance 3B: Using 
questioning and discussion techniques as measured by the improvements in the ADVANCE system and teacher practice.

need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Students will take the baseline assessment in ELA and Math 
using the NYCDOE BOY Performance Assessment and 
Performance Series. Based on the data scholars will be immersed 
in small and whole group instruction where teachers will craft 
DOK questions and talking prompts for scholars to gain deeper 
thinking in content areas.  

Teachers will incorporate guided reading instruction 4x per week 
and homogeneous math instruction in their daily lessons. Grades 
3-5 scholars will participate in PI-personalized instruction 
academy. Scholars are grouped in academic levels and receive 
level based instruction. 8 weeks for 1.5 hours 2x a week. The 
focus will be on math concepts and standards mastery. Teachers 
will monitor progress via classroom assessment and make 
adjustments as needed. A strong focus on standards will be 
implemented. Teachers will continue to work in professional 
learning communities to enhance their practice.  

Scholars and parents will have access to the Go Math think 
central computer programs and Moby Max that will be used in 
the classroom and outside to reinforce and enrich literacy and 
mathematics skills. 

The school will facilitate common core workshops for parents 
and engage in more training in CCLS to become an expert. 
Teachers will be engaged in unpacking standards and developing 
teaching points for driving instruction. Support staff will

In February 2019 we will do a teacher survey identifying strategies they learned and applied as well as what need 
teachers have. We will look at improved practice in classrooms as observed by the ADVANCE observations and 
scholar work. Preparation periods and Teacher Team Time are where teachers have times to meet as a group to 
analyze and discuss scholar work and what strategies should be made to improve instruction and learning . Our open 
houses are set up to engage our parents and invite them to participate in academic activities to help their learning 
and understanding of content.  

100% of the teachers and paraprofessionals will be immersed in ongoing professional development and professional 
learning communities. Running records 4x a year, Teacher and scholar observations, conversations, conference notes,

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

As a school we are very strong with providing the resources and support. We are very inclusive and all of our activities 
for parents have an instructional twist. The parent coordinator is inviting and continously uses flyers, email, telephone 
calls to keep parents informed and invited. We look at the attendance sheets from events and activities we have at 
the school. We survey our parents to find out what they would like to see in their school and how they can help. We 
host monthly open houses, coffee & conversations and parent Tuesdays to support parent learning. Trends that we 
see are that when activities are around scholar performances and social events our parents come out, however for a 
workshop or an instructional activity we don't have a large number of attendees. We ensure our social events have an 
instructional twist to inform our parents. We utilize the email, back pack and telephone messenger to keep parents 
informed. Our priority is to: 

increase parent participation throughout the school 
inform parents and make them volunteer in their scholar's classroom 
invite parents to network with each other and develop partnerships 
learn more about how to help their scholar be successful academically and socially 
have parents utilize the services and resources we provide 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, the school will collaborate with the School Leadership Team and Parent, Teachers Association to develop 
partnerships with families and community partners to increase parent engagement as measured by attendance at 
activities events. We will look to increase parent participation at workshops and meetings by 5%.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
The school works closely with the HR point person in identification of highly effective qualified teachers. We attend 
the DOE hiring fairs, utilize the Open Market system and other DOE tools to gather resumes of prospective 
candidates. We ensure our hires have the proper credentials prior to interviewing. We request prospective teachers 
to bring a portfolio and be able to talk to it. We have also contacted the local colleges and universities for candidates 
to do their student teaching and then we have an impact on training and exposing them to the profession. We also 
support our paraprofessionals who are continuing their education to help them learn and become master teachers. 

We support retention of our teachers through continual professional development strategies both in teams and 
through individualized support as needed. The administrative team works one to one with each teacher to identify 
areas of support, concern and next steps. A professional plan of action or discussion is in place to help the teachers 
grow professionally. Teachers have access to computers, laptops, smartboards, tablets, supplies and ongoing training. 
We are committed to retaining our teachers, encouraging them to participate and developing a trust and love of 
teaching. We provide tenure information for our untenured teachers and help them to visit best practice classrooms 
and take back some strategies for success. As required new teachers are matched with mentors who provide them 
ongoing support. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
All staff receives professional development that enables our students to meet Common Core Learning Standards. We 
employ the following strategies: 

● Provide mandated professional development on the Mondays and Tuesdays for teachers and paraprofessionals 

● Professional Development team plans and executes professional development on Mondays-they bring in 
professionals, present specific topics from a survey they provided to staff and assign webinars and videos for staff. 

● Provide focused Professional Development on the CCLS, Guided Reading and Math Instruction so that we can 
become experts on those three items.

We have an open house where the parents and students can come and take a tour of the building. The Kindergarten 
teachers speak about the expectations in Kindergarten and do a hands on workshop with the parents and incoming 
students. We have developed a partnership with the local day care centers and we do workshops for their parents at 
their site, as well as we do tours once a year for their students. We also prepare a “Getting Ready for Kindergarten” 
packet that is given to our parents at registration with a few items they need to work on with their children 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
There are various teams such as the Professional Development team, Teacher Teams and teams that regularly make 
decisions to measure what is going on in the building. These teams survey teachers, analyze results, plan for 
professional development.

Teacher teams meet regularly and make instructional decisions that impact the entire school community. Teachers 
have the leverage to make decisions about assessments in their grades and classes to measure student progress. We 
have a team that meets and discusses the results of the state assessments, reviews the various types of assessments 
that can be used to measure student learning and decides what the school will use as a measure. This team meets 
with the total staff body and discusses their decisions to make everyone aware of the focus grade, the type of 
assessment and how we need to improve instruction to improve results. Teachers are given a copy of the final 
decisions and as a school we pair resources and manpower into those target grades. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)  

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Therefore our school P.S.36Q is in compliance with the Title I regulations and 
the ESSA requirements responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the 
connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed 
to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of 
their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and 
Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of our school community.  
 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

P.S.36Q will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

The goal of the PIP for P.S.36Q is to strengthen and broaden the partnerships between parents and the school 
through active participation. P.S. 36Q is a very diverse school. There are many cultures that merge to make up the 
fabric of the school. Parents are a vital part of the success of the school and their children. The school provides 
academic social events to keep the parents engaged and interacting with their children. PTA and SLT are integral in 
helping parents navigate the school. Our process for reporting parental involvement is attendance sheets at events. 

P.S.36Q does a full outreach to keep parents involved via our telephone messenger, emails, newsletters, back pack 
flyers, courtesy call and invitations.  

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress;

languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

P.S. 36Q Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. Our 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input.  

 

Our school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

This program will address the lowest performing ENL scholars in grades K-5 who are on the 
Entering and Emerging levels with 20 minutes daily support in the mornings. Scholars who are 
on the Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding levels will receive additional support and 
services in our inclusive before school program, and will be funded through Title I money.  This 
program will begin in October, 2018 and end in May, 2019 from 8:00 AM-8:20 AM daily on 
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday mornings..  There will be 1 certified ENL teacher and a 
certified general ed or special education teacher who will work with small groups of 7-8 
scholars.  A supervisor will be on hand at all times in case of any emergencies, and to ensure the 
quality of instruction.  Instruction will be provided to three different student groups: K-1, 2-3, 4-
5.  The teacher will differentiate each group by ENL level of Entering and Emerging.  The before 
school program will be utilized to prepare each student for the NYSESLAT exam which will be 
administered in Spring, 2019 in addition to enhancing the child's facility with conversational and 
academic English.  Entering and Emerging ENL scholars in grades 3-5 will receive additional 
support via this program to prepare them for the NYSED ELA and Math exams in addition to the 
NYSESLAT.  The use of Wilson and Max scholar will provide direct instruction for the scholars. 
The use of  Imagine Learning as well as the SPIRE reading intervention will also be supports to 
incorporate phonological awareness, spelling and phonics.  Instruction will follow a balanced 
literacy model with inclusion of phonics instruction, exposure to language through read alouds, 
vocabulary development and written response to literature.  Specific NYSESLAT preparations 
materials such as Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT , and Teaching ELLs for Academic 
Language Mastery have been selected, since we are looking for the best program to fit the needs 
of our students. 
The rationale for this program is to move our lowest functioning ENL students who are 
progressing at a lower speed than their ENL peers and English dominant peers who are attaining 
levels 3 and 4 on the NYSED exams in ELA and Mathematics.  It is evident according to the 
data that our ENL  population makes progress in the areas of listening and speaking components 
of the NYSESLAT,  However, they fall short in the reading and writing components of the 
exam.  This is primarily due to our ENL students acquiring basic interpersonal communication 
skills (BICS) more easily as compared to the more difficult development of cognitive academic 
language proficiency (CALP).

In order to promote academic excellence th and quality instruction for our ENL students, the 
certified ENL teacher and the certified general education or special education teacher will be 
delivering instruction in our Title III before school program will receive training in the following 
areas: 
1.  Scaffolding Instruction of ENL students:  The workshop will cover curriculum in both 
literacy and mathematics.  Through the workshop teachers will study guides which were 
prepared for teachers that are Common Core aligned and research - based instructional strategies 
for developing content and language with ENL students. 
2.  Common Core Videos for ENL Instruction:  Our teachers will be provided with 
webinars throughout the year, to stay abreast of resources that will be helpful for ENL student 
growth.  The Teaching Channel Videos will also be used as a resource for our teachers in order 
to have Common Core lessons for their English Language Learners which include differentiation 
to help meet the needs of our ENL students. 
3.  A New Pedagogical Framework for English Language Development:  This workshop will 
allow our ENL teacher to address the challenges which are faced daily with ENL students in 
regards to implementing college and career readiness skills who are new to acquiring the English 
language.  The workshop will raise expectations and instructional rigor in the classrooms for our 
ENL scholars. 
4.  Understanding Assessment and Evaluation Results to Determine High-Leverage 
Practices:  This workshop will allow our special education teacher to stay abreast of multiple 
sources of information to develop a comprehensive understanding of a student's strengths and 
needs.  
The ENL teacher and general and/or special education teacher will attend Queens South 
BFSC training in meeting the needs of ENL students. Ms. Tanya Hampton and  Ms. Shannon 
Lamptey will turnkey the information during the PS 36Q Professional Learning 
Development Communities on Monday afternoons from 2:45pm to 4:00pm, during Teacher 
Teams, and Common Preparatory periods.  Webinars will also be used to support the 
pedagogues  as well as literature provided by the administrators.  All records for professional 
learning are kept on file in the administration's  office. 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities

The P.S. 36 Parent Involvement Policy is inclusive of all ENL parents.  The academic, social, 
and emotional experience of students will be enhanced as a result the school's increased parent 
participation specifically for those who are ELLs.  As required under Title I and Title III, a 
parent meeting is held before the end of November(October 17, 2018)outlining the P.S. 36Q 
Parent Involvement Policy (PIP) and the School Parent Compact.  Both documents are 
distributed in English and in various native language. 
As a direct outgrowth of the parent involvement policy here at P.S. 36Q, our school will continue 
to implement the position of a full time Parent Coordinator.  The main responsibility of our 
Parent Coordinator is to promote parent engagement and address parents' questions and

Communication - Notification to Parents 
All parents will be notified  in their native language of all school activities including Title III 
Parent Engagement activities by telephone messenger, brochures, letters, invitations and a 
flyers with specific information about the workshops. There will also be translation signage in 
the building.  P.S. 36  has staff members who are committed to interpreting face to face meetings 
with parents.  The DOE Vendor: THE BIG WORD will also be use for on-site interpretations 
and the Language Line.  For all events, we will utilize a translation and interpretation team which 
will consist of parent volunteers, and various P.S> 36 Q staff members.  P.S. 36Q is in the 
process of purchasing interpretation equipment, so when attending a meeting, the parent can 
wear a head phone through which the translated content can be heard simultaneously. 
All records including agendas and attendance sheets for professional learning will be kept on file 
in the administrative main office.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The assessment tools that are used to assess early literacy skills of ELLs in our building is TCRWP.  Throughout the year, our 
ELLs are assessed using TCRWP four times during the following months: November, January, March and June.  This allows us to 
monitor student progress.  Each child is tested independently.  At the end of the assessment the child is given an independent 
reading level.  This data allows us to see the next steps of where students need to improve in terms of reading, fluency, and 
comprehension.  This reading assessment drives our instruction in the proper places.  It allows us to see different patterns and 
trends in their fluency along with their comprehension.  Data attained by the running records allows teachers to see areas of 
strengths/weaknesses and areas that need improvement when concerning basic literacy skills of our ELL students.  We also use

the MOSL assessment in grades K-5.  This  tool measures student learning, with the aim that schools and teachers use the data 
to drive instructional-decision making, while preparing all students for college and career. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

We make sure that second language development is targeted in order for our ELL students to succeed.  We have a strong 
foundation for our children in literacy instruction which is aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards.  This instruction is 
delivered through rigorous lesson plans which align themselves to the Standards.  Daily, children receive approximately over 
200 minutes of direct literacy instruction through phonics, reading, and writing.  However, literacy is taught across all content 
areas (math, science, and social studies) everyday.  This allows for students to transition smoothly into acquiring a second 
language (English) fluently. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The following assessments are used to identify baseline progress and areas of need:  K-2 NYC Performance Task in Reading and 
Math, and grades 3-5 use the Performance Series in Reading and Math.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

These assessments are given twice a year.  It allows for administrators along with other service providers of ELL students 
(general/special education teachers and the ENL teacher) to hone in on the results of the assessment and drive their 
instruction.  As a team, we study the data and create an action plan in order to help each child become stronger in that 
particular area.  Based on these assessments, we create long and short term goals for our students.  Goals drive and motivate 
students to do better and make room for improvement.  Through data, our ELL students are lacking progress specifically in 
ELA, both reading and writing.  Having the results from the assessments, we can analyze and hone in on the areas we need 
to.  Therefore, as a whole we feel it is imperative to make our goals reasonable along with measurable.  ELL native languages 
become secondary to the acquisition of English language skills.  In our ENL program, English only is emphasized.  Native 
language is only used when translation from native language to English is absolutely necessary. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Looking at data not only amongst ELLs in our school but across all grades in the building we are aware that the RTI framework 
is something that must be implemented in the regular schedule for our students.  In order to better support our ELLs and focus 
on improving their  academics, we use various interventions.  Our main focus is to make student success happen on his/her 
grade level.  RTI is a researched based intervention system.  When using the following interventions our children seem to grasp 
concepts better. 
1.  Small Group Instruction using Language Learning Prompts and Framed Paragraphs 
2.  Differentiated Instruction using Language Learning Prompts and Framed Paragraphs 
3.  Extra instruction in the Wilson/Fundations Program (Phonics Program)/ S.P.I.R. E. Program 
4.  Guided/support practice 
5.  Use of graphic organizers to help aid in note taking and writing 
6.  Hands on learning with manipulatives and realia 
7.  Technology/visual learning styles    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Reviewing the data for both the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT exam, the there is a mixture of students who are at the 
Emerging/Transitioning level than at the Entering level.  Out of our 24 ELL students present at P.S. 36, 7 students are at the 
intermediate Emerging (Low Intermediate)/Transitioning(Intermediate) levels of proficiency.  A trend noticed in the results of 
both the NYSITELL and the the NYSESLAT results are that the transitioning levels fall in the following grades: 2 in Kindergarten, 
1 in 1st grade, 2 in 2nd, 1 in 3rd grade, and 1 in 4thgrade.   The data states that we only have 4 Entering students (1 in 
Kindergarten, 1 in 1st grade, and 2 in 4th grade).  Instruction needs to be rigorous in every grade but especially in the grades 
lacking advanced proficiency.  We must make sure that building background knowledge is incorporated into instruction along 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

with best practices in order to achieve ELL success in all grades.   As students progress to the next band of the NYSESLAT,  ELLs 
find the higher level of skills assessed much more difficult (ex: 2  nd   graders take the same test as the 3  rd   graders).  Overall, 
student progress is shown as they are promoted to the next grade level.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

With the demands of the intense Learning Standards, content areas are delivered through literacy instruction on a day to day 
basis.  We are using the Engage NY for Literacy and Go Math! for Mathematics.  With these two programs being utilized in our 
school by staff, the content is delivered rigorously.  This will allow children to become engrossed with academic vocabulary 
and engaging activities to allow for learning in modalities to take place.  Differentiation and multiple entry points are vital 
when it comes to the learning process that takes place amongst our ELL students.  They come from different backgrounds as 
well as different grade levels.  At the current moment we do not have any SIFE students.  However, if there were any 
SIFE students we would make sure that we offer the appropriate learning tools in the classrooms to help them understand the 
different components of the English language to the best of their ability. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

P.S.36 provides freestanding ENL to 24 students across grades K-5.  These children are grouped in English proficiency 
levels and  
they receive the allocated instructional minutes that are required.  The ENL teacher groups the ELL students based on 
their level in English which is provided either by the NYSITELL (new admits) or the NYSESLAT.  The push in/pull out 
model is utilized for the delivery of instruction.  When deemed necessary, co-teaching does take place under certain 
circumstances pertaining to ELL classroom instruction.  Currently we have 3 Transitioning ELLs, 4 Emerging ELLs, 4 
Entering ELLs, 12 Expanding ELLs, and 1 Commanding ELL. 
 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

NON APPLICABLE 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

NON APPLICABLE 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Entering and Emerging students are grouped together and seen 2 to 3 times a day based on pull out/push in 
services.  Both groups are given 360 minutes of instruction. Children at the Entering level receive a minimum of 180 minutes of 
standalone ENL services and a minimum of 180 integrated ENL/ELA services.  However, ELLs at the Emerging level receive a 
minimum of 90 minutes standalone ENL services, a minimum of 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA, and the flexibility of 90 
minutes of standalone or integrated ENL (with ELA or any other content area).  ELLs at the Expanding level receive 180 minutes 
a week in ENL/ELA or other content area based on the same pull out/push in service.  Currently, we have 1 student at the 
Proficient/Commanding level who receives 90 minutes of service a week of integrated ENL/ELA or other content areas. 
     
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   With the demands of the intense Common Core Learning Standards, content areas are delivered through literacy instruction 
on a day to day basis.  We are using Engage NY for our ELA and Math subjects.  With these 2 programs being used in our school 
by staff, content is delivered through literacy everyday.  Both curriculums are Common Core aligned.  The lesson plans that fall 
within the curriculum are extremely rigorous and allow for children to become engrossed with academic vocabulary and 
engaging activities to allow for learning in modalities to take place. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   We have staff members that speak both native languages at P.S. 36 (for e.g. Spanish, French-Creole, French, Ga, Twi, Urdu, 
and Haitian-Creole).  They aid in translation to help us properly evaluate students when necessary.  If necessary the Language 
Line is also utilized. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Differentiation and multiple entry points are vital when it comes to the learning process that takes place amongst our ELL 
students.  
They come from different backgrounds as well as different grade levels.  Therefore, it is imperative for all staff members who 
come in contact with ELL students to take into consideration that they are an ELL.  At the current moment we do not have any 
SIFE students.  However, if there were any SIFE students we would make sure that we offer the appropriate learning tools in 
the  
classrooms to help them understand different components of the English language to the best of their ability.  Some things 
that are in place for students are: 
1.  Spanish/Haitian - Creole dictionaries 
2.  Glossaries 
3.  Educational Videos 
4.  Picture cards/Cues 
5.  Hands-On Learning 
6.  School trips 
7.  Jamaica Reads - (one to one tutorial 4 days a week) 
8. Moby Max Reading/Math Program 
9.  Imagine Learning + Literacy 
10. Support Staff 
        Out of our 24 ELL students only 7 students come from another country ( Yemen, Pilipino and Haiti).  These students have 
acquired the language and can communicate very well with their peers and teachers pertaining to the English 
language.  However, they are still weak in areas of writing, reading and math.  Out of our 24 ELL students, 20 of them fall into 
the category of receiving services between 0-3 years.  The other 4 students fall in the category of 4 to 6 years of service.  We 
have no students that have had 6+ years of services.  This data is based is based on last year's assessments.  We are currently 
using the Engage NY curriculum.  Engage NY is Common Core aligned and is geared to prepare these students to succeed to 
the best of their ability.  The curriculum promotes the use of English for information and understanding in order for them to 
communicate effectively in social and academic settings.  The ENL teacher provides comprehensive literacy instruction utilizing 
the balanced literacy approach which includes read alouds and shared independent reading and writing.  The ENL teacher 
accesses the CCLS by means of best practices such as: review, engagement, identifying explicitly the language and content 
objectives, three phases of learning (preparing to learn, interacting with the text, and extending the learning),input and 
modeling, checking for understanding, guided practice, and independent practice.  Core subjects are also covered in 
mathematics, social studies, and science.  As stated earlier, content is addressed through literacy also in our ELA literacy 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

block.  The Imagine Language & Literacy Program has also been implemented at P.S. 36Q.  This program focuses on the five 
areas of literacy as well as essential domains of language:  reading, writing, speaking and listening.  Imagine Learning 
differentiates instruction for every student, allowing students to accelerate or review what is needed.  Teachers also have 
access to numerous resources and real-time data for intervention.  This program is a great tool for one-on-one instruction, but 
it can also be incorporated into small-group and whole-class instruction. 
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
        Pertaining to ELLs with disabilities we use many instructional strategies in order to provide access to content areas which 
helps accelerate English language development.  Test preparation, word-picture association, vocabulary building and 
comprehension are taught within subject areas.  Literacy is taught across content areas, which helps significantly in English 
language development amongst students with disabilities.  With the help of bilingual dictionaries and bilingual glossaries, 
students are able to have additional comprehension resources and inputs in their subject areas.  Students with disabilities are 
often paired with other ENL students of the same native language to help them partner off one another with gaining 
collaborative learning through peers.  Academic intervention services include the Wilson/Fundations Program for K-3 and 
special education classrooms.  Grades 4 and 5 ELL students are heavily immersed in computer activities to help them with 
comprehension of certain subject areas.  S.P.I.R.E. is a research -proven reading reading intervention program (Grades 1 - 5) 
for the lowest performing students.  It is designed to build reading success through an intensive, structured, and spiraling 
curriculum that incorporates phonological awareness, phonics, spelling, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension in a 
systematic plan.  Cognitive mapping in classrooms and visuals which are presented through the computer allow for ELL 
students to gain understanding.  The use of intervention strategies begins by identifying where the students are having 
difficulty and then finding ways to help them overcome their problems.  We introduce the new students to new language 
slowly and in context.  If necessary, students may respond in non verbal ways to show comprehension of the instructional 
material.  Phonics instruction is on going, along with pictures, gestures, and most importantly repetition.  Working on skills 
such as sequencing, comparing and contrasting, cause and effect, and academic vocabulary development is what children need 
more of in order to master the reading and writing component.  Providing more writing opportunities to compose letters, 
invitations, cards,  paragraphs, and daily notes help develop these skills on a daily basis.  In order to help ELLs who have 
disabilities construct meaning and understanding, the teacher encourages students to draw upon their own personal 
knowledge along with building background/prior knowledge in which they can make connections in real life.  Allowing for 
personal knowledge and tapping into their prior background in their native language is a strategy that is implemented 
daily.  Utilizing educational games, pictures, objects, big books, and story images creates time to share experiences and explicit 
details and simplified English takes place. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
        When necessary we differentiate our curriculum for ELL students with disabilities.  We must adapt certain lessons and use 
framed paragraphs, Language Learning Prompts in specific areas in order to reach the needs of our students. At times, we 
must go back and re-teach certain objectives so that our students who do have disabilities grasp the concept being 
taught.  One to one conferring and conferences occur in order to assess whether a child needs more instruction in that 
particular subject area. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
As stated above there are many intervention programs that are utilized throughout the year, in order for our children to 
succeed to the best of their ability.  We use the push in/pull out model, which consists of small group instruction.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

This is our second year using the ELA curriculum and a new Math curriculum.  We are using Engage NY and Go Math!, these are 
aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards.  We will also be offering additional workshops for the parents of ELL students 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

in order to help the parents have a better understanding on how to help their child succeed both in school and at 
home.  Parents are the key to their child's success.  Topics of concern that will be presented through these workshops are: 
1.  Homework:  Helpful skills on how to help your children complete homework 
2. Moby Max-Diagnostic & Instruction 
3. Technology:  How to use technology to aid in your child's academics? 
4. Phonics/Reading Strategies:  What can you do at home to help your child succeed?  
5. Imagine Language & Literacy 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

All programs that are in place for ELL students will continue for the 2018-2019 school year.    
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELL students are treated just like the regular education population at P.S. 36.  The same curriculum is taught, however if there 
is a need for extra assistance in certain areas they will be provided with the additional resources and tools 
needed.  Additionally, we offer Academic Intervention Services through the school day for children who are struggling in both 
ELA and Math.  Our ELL students are part of this program in order to help strengthen their skills in these areas.  Saturday 
Academy is also available for extra support.  In the latter part of the year, closer to the state ELA and Math exams, we offer 
after school programs that prepare our students for the new Common Core aligned state exams.    
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Students are constantly given instructional materials that meet their needs.  Technology is always available through computers 
and SMART Boards which are located in all classrooms throughout the two main buildings at P.S. 36.  We have leveled libraries 
and collaborative learning centers in classrooms, which relate to all content areas (math centers, reading/library centers, 
science centers, social studies centers).  This allows students to use manipulatives, and have a hands-on learning environment 
in all content areas.  Which in turn, will create an engaging learning experience for all ELL students.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Whenever we notice confusion amongst our ELL students pertaining to the components of the English language, and they need 
support in their native language we have on site translators.  These on site translators are present in the school building and 
we contact them for any support necessary.  Our translators are always wiling to aid in the translation of languages under any 
circumstances in order to make any skill/objective clear for the student.  The main focus for the ELL students at P.S. 36 is to 
help students acquire the English language as fast as they can so that they can function independently in their classrooms.  The 
native language is not used in the ENL setting, however we have ample resources in place for our ELL students.  Various 
reference materials are available in the ENL office.  We have bilingual glossaries and dictionaries readily accessible for our 
students.  Another tool we frequently use for support is the computer in order to help with translation/communication 
needs.  Teachers also provide buddies/partners who may speak the same language for newly enrolled ELL students.  Also, our 
staff members who speak another language besides English always aid in translations within the classroom setting when 
necessary.  This allows for an ELL student to comprehend things in their native language along with feeling more comfortable 
in their learning environment.  We currently have one Spanish speaking para-professionals who aids ELL students in 
classrooms.  This allows for students to have language support of content being taught in those classrooms. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Throughout the school building there are ample resources that are easily accessible for our ELL students.  Also, in the ENL 
classroom there are grade appropriate materials in various languages.  This offers support to ELL children in their native 
language.  Students requiring more language support are provided with an alternate placement paraprofessional to modify 
lessons and activities in the students native languages. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Students are constantly given instructional materials that meet their needs.  Technology is always available through computers 
and SMART Boards which are located in all classrooms throughout the two main buildings at P.S. 36.  We have leveled libraries 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

and collaborative learning centers in classrooms, which relate to all content areas (math centers, reading/library centers, 
science centers, social studies centers).  This allows students to use manipulatives and have a hands-on learning environment 
in all content areas.  This creates an engaging learning experience for all ELL students. The Imagine Learning Program focuses 
on the five areas of literacy, and it differentiates instruction for every student, allowing students to accelerate or review what 
is needed.  Teachers also have access to numerous resources and real-time data for intervention. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
If ELL students enroll before the school year starts they are given the summer packet that was created by a team of 
teachers.  The summer packets consist of engaging activities that are Common Core aligned and help the children keep abreast 
of their academics while on summer vacation.  During the year we have many activities that allow for ELL students to socialize 
amongst peers while supporting instruction in all subject areas:  Some of those activities are: 
 
1.  Pajama Rama: K-2 
2.  Robotix: Grades 3 and 4 
3.  Art Institute: K and 1 
4.  Clubs: K-5 
5. Tennis: Grades 3 and 4 
6.  Swimming: Grade 2 
7.  Ballroom Dancing:  Grades 4 and 5 
8.  Multicultural Day:  K-5 
9.  Jump Rope for Heart: K-5 
10. Jamaica Reads: K and 1 
11.  Pearls of Wisdom 
12. Ties that Bind

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 
 At P.S. 36 we have 1 ENL teacher.  She receives on-going professional development, which is provided by the district.   In turn, 
the ENL  teacher turns key with staff members regarding effective frameworks for teaching.  Many of these professional 
development sessions allow for necessary training on how to scaffold instruction, various reading and writing strategies, and 
the three phases of learning. She also participates in webinars to keep abreast of all the new trends that are 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

 

commonly  seen amongst ELL students.    
 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
School personnel who work with ELL students are encouraged to exhibit patience and understanding with the many everyday 
ELL challenges.  Every effort is made to provide additional support to families in need.  Explaining and demonstrating the 
school's rules and regulations is an on-going requirement.  This needs to occur in order to full integrate these students into our 
school culture.  The ENL teacher works with the  Guidance Counselor as students are transitioning to Middle School.  They try 
to find the best placement for each child based on their individualized needs.  ELL students are given ample support where 
needed as they transition from one school level to another.  Parents are encouraged to meet with school personnel to deal 
with any problems that may arise.  Professional Development is provided for staff members at P.S. 36 during specific Teacher 
Team Meetings.  Assigned dates are given to the ENL teacher throughout the entirety of the academic school year.  She helps 
provide teachers with important teaching practices/resources to help aid regular and special education teachers in instruction 
that will reach our ELL students.  Topics that have been discussed amongst staff focus on Imagine Learning, Language Learning 
Prompts, Three Phases of Learning, Instructional Conversations, differentiation of instruction and guided reading, which 
include useful strategies specifically geared for ELLs and ELLs with special needs.  Some other topics of ELL training include: the 
process of second language acquisition, content area strategies for ELL students, cognitive mapping/visual tools that aid 
instruction pertaining to the ELL and accessing the CCLS - best practices for ELL students.    All attendance sheets, agendas and 
any material distributed pertaining to Professional Development are kept in a binder in the ENL teacher's classroom.  A copy is 
also distributed to the Principal and Assistant Principals. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
P.S. 36 provides annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language development 
progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas by arranging a 
schedule per grade for parents.  All meetings are set up K-5 individually.  Therefore, the ENL teacher is able to address all of 
the standards and requirements for that grade.  These meetings are done in conjunction with parent-teacher conferences, 
initial parent orientations, and quarterly progress meetings.  All of the necessary school staff attend the meetings.  If 
translation is needed Ms. Suzie Dorsainvil  will be present to translate in Haitian/French- Creole, and French. 
Ms.  Elayne Familia is present for Spanish speaking parents, Ms.  Shannon Adotelamptey is present for Ga and Twi speaking 
parents, and Ms. Jahanara Hasan will translate  for Urdu/Punjabi speaking parents. If parents need further translations 
services, the ENL teacher will also utilized the Language and Translation Interpretation Unit.   All of the parents are invited 
through telephone contacts, back packed letters by students and mailings.  All participants sign in and attendance is kept in the 
ENL teacher's ENL Binder.  Each child's progressions and successes are documented, any struggles and difficulties are 
discussed.  Lastly, parents are informed of any goals that their child has mastered or displayed difficulty in attaining those 
goals.  Parents are given a copy of all information that was discussed and a copy is placed in the ENL binder.  All records and 
letters mailed out or given out are kept in an ENL Binder.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
At the St. Albans School there are various activities that foster parental involvement for parents of our ELLs.  We offer monthly

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
We partner with several agencies such as Zen Masters, Department of Parks - Learn to Swim Program/Tennis Program to name a 
few.  We also provide mental health services with outside agencies.  Children are also provided with dental and vision services.  At 
P.S. 36 the needs of all parents are evaluated.  Workshops are offered for ELL parents, and during these workshops we ask for 
feedback.  We ask them to provide specific areas where help is needed, or in any area they maybe struggling with pertaining to 
their child or themselves.  Parents are invited and included in all school functions such as PTA meetings, parent teacher 
conferences, assembly programs, school social and instructional workshops.  The ENL teacher, occupational therapist, 
SETSS teacher, and Administration engage parents in all activities and provide translation services.  During workshops, a translator 
is present to help present the information about the school system and programs in place in their native language.  Feedback from 
parents is crucial because it drives us as educators to help parents aid in making their child successful.  We send information via 
telephone, backpacked by students, and mailings.  Posters and newsletters are on all main entrance walls in order to alert parents 
to the ongoing activities, workshops, and meetings in the school, in the district, and within and throughout the entire city.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Lynn Staton, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

At P.S. 36 the Home Language Survey is a useful piece of data, because it ensures that all parents are provided 
with the appropriate language in which they can speak and understand. ATS reports are used also to identify 
parents preferred language of choice. All Student Emergency Contact cards are written in the parents/guardians 
native language. The school distributes Parent Surveys to continuously update language preferences. The ENL 
teacher and LAP team ensure that all parents feel comfortable both receiving and giving information in their 
native language pertaining to both the school and their child's/children's academic development. We try 
extremely hard to create a positive parental partnership with our English Language Learner parents. One of our 
goals is to make them feel comfortable with the school and the environment that their child is going to be 
learning in. P.S.36 has on-site teachers/para-professionals and an occupational therapist as translators in Spanish, 
Ga, Twi, French, French-Creole, Haitian Creole, and Urdu languages. We ensure that all of the school 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

information/memos and monthly calendars/newsletters are translated in their native languages so that the 
information is easily accessible to them. One of our main priorities is enhancing communication with the ELL 
parents at P.S. 36. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In the event of a school emergency staff members will call limited-English proficient families and interpret information 
in their native language. The ENL teacher will also mail and backpack home translated documents. The Language 
Translation Unit will also be used to reach those families in case of an emergency. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

At P.S. 36 we have one certified ENL teacher. She receives on-going professional development, which is provided by 
the district. She also participates in webinars. Assigned dates are given to the ENL teacher throughout the entirety of 
the academic school year. All attendance sheets, agendas, and any material distributed are kept in a binder in the ENL 
teacher's classroom. A copy is also distributed to the Principal and Assistant Principals. In turn, the ENL teacher who is 
also the Language Access Coordinator turns key with staff members during Professional Development, Common 
Preps, and Teacher Team Meetings. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Parental notifications are always fulfilled for translation and interpretation services. We strive upon excellence to 
keep parents updated on their rights and services. Keeping the lines of communication open is an on-going 
commitment to servicing the community. Posters are on the main entrance walls in order to keep parents 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71 

 

enlightened. Literature and follow-up information is given via telephone, back packed by students and mailed home. 
The ENL teacher and Parent Coordinator will also host meetings with ENL parents to discuss the various services 
available in the school. Literature is also readily available in the multipurpose area of the school and on the second 
floor in the General Office.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

At P.S. 36 gathering feedback from parents on the quality and the availability of school wide and community services 
is a top priority. Parents are invited and included in all school functions such as PTA meetings, parent teacher 
conferences, assembly programs, school social and instructional workshops. The ENL teacher, occupational therapist, 
SETSS teacher, and administration engage parents in all activities and provide translation services. We also offer 
workshops for ELL parents. During these workshops we ask for feedback. We ask for them to provide areas that they 
need help on or that they may be struggling with either pertaining to their child or themselves. During workshops, a 
translator is present to help present the information to the ENL teacher. Also, we make parents aware of the NYC DOE 
website, which provides an abundance of information about the school system and programs in place in their native 
language. Feedback from parents is crucial, because it drives us as educators to help parents aid in making their child 
successful. During all functions at our school we make sure that we have a staff member on-site to help translate for 
parents who speak Spanish, Haitian, French, and Urdu. We send information via telephone, back pack by students, 
and mailings. Posters and newsletters are on all main entrance walls in order to alert parents to the ongoing activities, 
workshops, and meetings in the school, in the district, and within and throughout the entire city. We partner with 
several agencies such as Zen Masters, Department of Parks - Learn to Swim Program/Tennis Program, Resident Art 
Institute and Cook Shop just to name a few. Furthermore, we provide mental health services with outside agencies. 
Lastly, children are provided with dental and vision screening services.
