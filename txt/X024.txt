Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

P. S. 24 recognizes that children are our future and we must prepare them to assume their roles as contributing 
members of society. Each child has individual needs, abilities, and aspirations. Our vision is one of a school that 
provides all children with the opportunity to achieve their personal best in all areas of development in cooperation 
with peers, staff, parents, and the larger community.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

Our mission is to engender excellence in academic endeavors and a respect for the similarities and differences that 
define our diverse population. This will be achieved through Next Generation Standards-based instruction that 
supports all learners based on their particular needs. Scaffolds and enrichment will be provided to accomplish this 
through ongoing assessment, small group instruction, intervention services provided by specialists, specialized classes 
and programs designed for high achieving students, integrated curricular studies, and talent development. Students 
will become engaged in authentic inquiry and evaluate their own progress in the pursuit of academic excellence.  

 

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P. S. 24 has several partnerships and initiatives in place that enrich our school community. School-wide SEL initiatives 
include Responsive Classroom practices facilitated by our Guidance Counselor and Conflict Resolution Coordinator. A 
school-wide focus on word study and academic vocabulary has also led to ongoing staff inquiry and to increased rigor 
in ELA curricula (Teacher's College) across all grades. P. S. 24’s strengths include our strong community involvement 
and active parent participation in the learning process. Our Parents Association helps fund classroom libraries, 
teaching assistants, technology, and other school-wide initiatives. Active parent involvement has helped maintain 
high academic achievement at our school and has helped maintain a stable student population. Another strength that 
our school possesses is our continued high achievement in core subject areas. A well-educated faculty and ongoing 
professional development, as well as teacher inquiry projects have helped build leadership capacity among all staff. 
Other strengths are our attention to the social/emotional well-being of all children, as demonstrated by the use of 
reflective student portfolios, the emphasis on the differentiated classroom, and the ICT classroom model. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

There are currently 911 students registered in kindergarten through grade 5 . The school population comprises 7% 
Black, 42% Hispanic, 37% White, 9% Asian. The student body includes 3% English language learners and 13% special 
education students. Boys account for 52% of the students enrolled and girls account for 48%. The average attendance 
rate for the school year 2017 - 2018 was 95%. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our instructional focus for the 2018-2019 school year was "At PS 24, students learn in nurturing environments where 
expectations are high, instruction is rigorous, and learning is student-centered. Teachers across all classrooms use 
common assessments to track progress toward individual student goals. If teachers use this assessment 
information to provide actionable and meaningful feedback to students regarding their achievement then both 
students and teachers will have a clear understanding of what is needed to improve their performance, promoting 
growth and resulting in higher levels of achievement across all content areas." 

This instructional focus was created, in collaboration with teachers, because the school community felt our two 
biggest needs were around checking for understanding and providing actionable feedback to enrich learning. Effective 
feedback was a need for all community members; administration to faculty, faculty to one another, teachers to 
students and students alike. The purpose of this feedback was to promoted growth and understanding of current best 
practices and the awareness of how to improve on those practices.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

 

When walking into classrooms, there is clear evidence that we are approaching on meeting this goal by listening to 
children speak to their current understanding of content and what they suggest as their next steps based on the 
feedback they have received from their teachers or peers.  

 

During our recent PPO and Quality Review visits, it was identified that we have made great strides in checking for 
understanding. Our school's will now focus on what we do with this check for understanding in the way of using this 
check/data to drive current/future lessons.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
During the 2017-18 school year 62% of students in K-5 were reading on grade level as per the Teacher College 
Benchmark for reading levels. 

P.S. 24 has made tremendous growth over the past two years in both NYS ELA & Math scores. In particular, we have 
seen a 17% jump from 2016 to 2018 (57% proficiency in 2016-17 to 73% proficiency in 2017-18) in NYS ELA scores. 
This is partially due to 79% of all females that took the state exam scoring at least a level 3. 

Despite the great gains made in ELA, male students at PS 24 are still under performing compared to the proficiency 
rates of their female peers (65% proficiency in males compared to 79% proficiency in females during the 2017-18 
school year). The gap in how female students perform vs. males has grown in the past year (14% in 2017-18 vs. 10% in 
2016-17).  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, at least 65 %percent of all students will be reading at or above grade level as measured by F and P 
standards.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

PS 24 received a proficient rating on the 2017-18 Quality Review in components 4.1 and 4.2. It was quoted that "The 
majority of teachers are engaged in structured, inquiry-based professional collaborations. Teacher teams consistently 
analyze assessment data in various forms and student work, using rubrics during collaborative grade level team and 
inquiry team meetings." This resulted in "Achievement of academic school goals has strengthened teachers’ 
instructional capacity, as noted in Advance report comparisons. Progress toward goals for groups of students is 
identified by comparing student data." 

Despite the proficient rating, 45% of teachers say that at their school teachers make a conscious effort to coordinate 
their teaching with instruction at other grade levels (-16% from the 2016-17 school year). This lack of vertical planning 
makes it more difficult for teachers to scaffold learning for students performing below grade level and to provide 
enrichment for students performing above grade level. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, all teachers will engage in the Data Wise initiative which will allow for the school to build strong teacher 
teams that take an inquiry stance on student work / data. This will result in sharing of best practices to improve 
pedagogy as measured by an increase .10 overall rating on Danielson.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Creation of scheduled that allows for vertical and horizontal 
planning time. Teachers will have at least two preps that allow to 
plan with a colleague either a grade above or below what they 
are teaching. In the departmental grades, teachers will be 
allowed two common planning periods to work within their 
content area with teachers in a different grade. 

Uploading of all curriculum / units of study to a Google drive that 
will allow all staff to view units below and above their grade 
level. This will allow for teachers to have access to all grades and 
allow for teachers to have the resources to plan for all students 
based on their individual needs. 

Data Wise Initiative- All staff will engage with Data Wise which 
will allow for teachers to take an inquiry approach to looking at 
data and student work and revise curriculum, unit plans, and 
daily lessons to meet the needs of all students. 

Creation of Teacher Instructional Cabinet - This will allow a grade 
representative to communicate with other grade representatives 
on best practices and get insight into what each grade is doing. 
This will allow for the sharing of best practices and an additional 
way to support one another in supporting students.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

The school has received a Proficient rating in components 1.3, 3.1, & 5.1 on the 2017-18 Quality Review. These 
components were not highlighted in the 2015-16 Quality Review.  

Results from P. S. 24’s Learning Environment Survey for the past five years have shown little or no growth in areas of 
communication and trust, based on responses from the staff until new administration came in 2016-17. The new 
principal has begun to put in systems and supports to have a positive effect on the Trust and Effective Leadership in 
the building. Although, the school made great gains in these areas (Effective School Leadership went from a rating of 
1.13 in 2015-16 to 2.65 during the 2016-17 school year to 2.03 (not including the proficient rating received in the 
recent Quality Review) in 2017-18, the school is still a full point below the district and citywide averages for that 
component.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, we will score at least a 3.00 total score for the component of Effective School Leadership in the School 
Quality Guide. This increase could be improved by increasing academic rigor in all grades, by monitoring reading level 
progress for all students, and by encouraging and sharing of effective practice among all teachers through the teacher 
evaluation system.

Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

P. S. 24’s Learning Environment Survey results have greatly increased in the past year related to Strong Family-
Community Ties. For instance the score on the Learning Environment Survey showed a 1.40pt increase (1.00 in 2016-
17 to 2.40 in 2017-18) in the measure of Outreach to Parents. Additionally, parents responded at a much larger rate 
from the prior year (up to 73% from the previous 39%). This resulted in the school receiving a "Developing" on the 
2015-16 Quality Review under component 3.4 to a Proficient in 2017-18. 

However, only 87% of families say that the they feel well-informed by the communications they receive from the 
school which is still 7% below the district average.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
At minimum, once a month teachers will send home communication to provide resources and strategies that families 
can use at home.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34 

 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Spuyten Duyvil, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the 
Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

 

Spuyten Duyvil will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

●Providing a "welcoming package" to all new families to inform them of expectation and resources that can be 
used.

outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

Using STH funds to support attendance and consistency. 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

 

 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

  The Title III Supplemental Program for English Language Learners will be an extension of our 
Title III Immigrant Funds Supplemental Program.  Many of our English Language Learners 
score below grade level when administered the Teacher's College Running Record Reading 
Assessments. English Language Learners also struggle with Math Word Problem as a result of 
their limited English academic vocabulary.  We plan to utilize a portion of these funds to run an 
after school program for students who have scored below grade level in the TC Running Records 
Assessments that will be administered in October 2018.  The program will target students in 
grades 1-5.  The program will run on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:30 - 3:30, 
from                January 16th  to March 28, 2019.  
 
The student instructional program, which will be conducted in English, will provide students will 
small group instruction in Reading, Writing, and Math.  Students will be grouped 
homogeneously by performance level.  The staff will consist of our Certified ENL Teacher, a 
Special Education Teacher, and two General Education Teachers.  We will utilize book sets that 
were previously bought with Title III funds.  In addition, students will also engage in literacy and 
math games that we already have in our school building. 
 
The parent instructional program will focus on enriching parent's English Language 
communication to enable them to communicate in daily life activities and with their children's 
teacher.  The program will be taught by our licensed ENL Teacher and will take place on 
Wednesdays and Thursdays from 3:45 - 4:45 p.m.  The parent instructional program will run 
from                November 28, 2018 through March 28, 2019.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our school uses TCRWP Running Records, Writing Assessments, student/teacher created rubrics, IREADY, and MOSL to assess 
the literacy of ELLs.  The Spanish LAB is used to provide baseline Spanish language literacy skills for Spanish Speaking students, 
upon determination of entitlement for ENL services .  The school in collaboration with the data specialist analyzes and creates 
an action plan after looking at the NYSESLAT results. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Classroom teachers assess Reading Levels three times a year or as deemed necessary by student progress.  Reading Levels are 
recorded in Teachers' College Assessment Pro.  The ENL Teacher can access the reading levels of all ELLs.  Classroom teacher 
and ENL teacher will analyze formative test results and use this data to plan instruction for ELLs.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of our programs for ELLs is evaluated using state exam data, as well as, local measures that include 
TCRWP Running Records, Fundations Unit Assessments, baseline/benchmark assessments in both Writing and Math, and 
others deemed necessary by instructional cabinet.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Being that our ENL Program is integrated, classroom teachers and ENL Teacher have an opportunity to collaborate closely with 
each other.  This will take place during Common Planning times where teachers review student work, assess data, and plan 
integrated Units of Study for ELLs. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Our school uses data to address misconceptions and differentiate unit plans and lesson plans to meet the needs of all ELLs.
  Data analysis takes place weekly during grade meetings. In addition, all ELL's go through our child study team to analyze how 
we can support the teacher and the student progress in all facets of their PS 24 experience (academically, emotionally, 
socially)  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Data patterns across proficiency levels and grades for NYSITELL and NYSESLAT show that as students advance from grade to 
grade, ELLs make proficiency level gains each year. The majority of Advanced level learners are concentrated in grades 3 
through 5, whereas the majority of beginner and intermediate level learners are found in grades K-1. Data patterns also reveal 
that ELLs are able to attain Proficient standards of achievement on NYSESLAT in each grade, with no one grade 
predominating.  Girls and boys are evenly split across all proficiency levels, and home languages and economic backgrounds 
are also distributed evenly across proficiency levels. Students with disabilities are performing overall at lower levels of 
proficiency across all grades; however, SWD who are also ELLs are able to achieve advanced levels of proficiency on NYSESLAT 
and NYSITELL.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Assessment outcomes will be shared with our school teachers during September's Conference Day, in order for all classroom 
and cluster teachers who work with English Language Learners to be informed and plan instruction to meet the needs of our 
ELLs.  Likewise, we will hold an information session for parents by the end of September.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Our school offers freestanding, integrated ENL to ELLs in all grades (K-5).  
Integrated ENL - The ENL teacher will co-teach with classroom teacher during the ELA block to provide ENL 
instruction. ELL's will be grouped heterogenously by grade and the ENL Teacher and Classroom teacher will work 
together to develop instruction to build English language skills through content area.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

At P. S. 24, we use results from The NYSITELL and NYSESLAT Exams to provide our English Language Learners with the 
mandated number of instructional minutes based on their proficiency level.  These minutes are provided through content-
based instruction for all ELLs. The ENL teacher provides ENL instructional minutes in English to general education and special 
education English Language Learners. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Content area instruction is delivered in English through the mandated instructional minutes in ENL by the ENL teacher 
regardless of proficiency level, grade, or general or special education. Instructional approaches and methods used to make 
content comprehensible include content-based language teaching, use of graphic organizers to build schema, activation of 
prior knowledge through rich discussion and accountable listening. Leveled texts are provided after reading, writing, and math 
baseline assessments are performed. ENL instruction is aligned with Common Core Learning Standards in ELA and in 
Mathematics for all ELLs. Input is made comprehensible through the use of scaffolding, graphic organizers, visuals and 
manipulatives, and through connections made to content-area learning in the regular classroom. Consultation and informal 
discussion with the general education and special education classroom teachers ensures that standards for content-based ESL 
instruction are kept high.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

 Spanish speaking students who are eligible for ENL services are administered the Spanish LAB upon registration in order to 
evaluate their Spanish language literacy. Translation of CCLS performance tasks and of classroom-based assessments is 
provided through direct translation in the students' native languages where applicable. State exams are administered in the 
students' native language, or an interpreter is provided where applicable. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a.     The ENL teacher will deliver instruction for SIFE students after interviewing and consulting with family members through 
the use of a translator, if necessary,  and with the regular classroom teacher. The instructional plan for SIFE students will 
include literacy assessments such as TCRWP,  and baseline writing and math assessments. After SIFE students’ needs are 
determined, the ENL teacher will implement leveled texts and literacy activities alongside work with reading strategies and 
possible phonics-based programs such as Fundations. 
b.    ELLs who have been in the country for three years or less (newcomers) receive much more scaffolding for reading and 
writing across content areas, receive more instruction in vocabulary and grammar, and receive help with listening 
comprehension in order to develop cognitive academic language proficiency. The ENL and classroom teachers provide this 
differentiation throughout the school day. Assessments for this group of ELLs include TCRWP reading assessments.  Work with 
Fundations is also included within differentiation for this group. This subgroup of ELLs also receives additional support when 
needed in communicating homework assignments and classroom expectations. Instruction is also differentiated for this group 
through the use of ENL materials, leveled texts, and other instructional aids that may be provided to the classroom teacher by 
the ENL teacher.   
c.      ELLs receiving 4 to 6 years of ENL instruction receive differentiated instruction by the ENL teacher. This instruction

includes assessments such as TCRWP reading assessments.  Students within this subgroup use leveled non-fiction and 
fiction texts that provide rich academic vocabulary and work with reading strategies, particularly in informational texts. 
Instruction for this subgroup is further differentiated by the ENL teacher in writing, where students receive more assistance 
and graphic organizers in order to complete complex writing assignments.   
d.      Long-Term ELLs receive differentiated instruction from the ENL teacher in the use of reading strategies, building schema 
using graphic organizers for reading and writing, and using problem-solving strategies and higher-order thinking across content 
areas. TCRWP reading assessments are used to analyze students’ needs, and leveled texts, rich vocabulary, and complex 
informational texts are provided to ensure student gains in ELA and Math.  
e.      Former ELLs receive two years of support through 90 minutes of integrated instruction during ELA or a content based 
subject. In addition, former ELLS receive two years of test accommodations similar to those offered to ELLs.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ELLs identified as having special needs receive differentiated instruction as per their IEP.  During ENL, the ENL teacher provides 
graphic organizers for use in reading comprehension and in planning for writing. The ENL teacher may also include work with 
Fundations in order to boost academic reading and writing skills. Students with special needs are given differentiated 
instruction in problem solving across content areas, and use of reading strategies across content areas in order to assist these 
students in meeting grade-level expectation in ELA and Math. ELLs who are also SWDs also use reciprocal teaching techniques 
in ENL in order to accelerate English language acquisition. Materials used for ELLs-SWDs include both levelled fiction and non-
fiction texts, common-core aligned content-area texts for close reading, math manipulatives, graphic organizers for writing, 
and realia and visual images to support science and social studies content area learning. and English language development.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
ELLs who are also SWDs are placed in ICT classrooms, primarily, in order to accelerate their academic learning and their English 
language acquisition.  In some instances, flexible grouping is used in ICT classrooms and in non-ICT classrooms in which 
ELL/SWDs are placed in order to provide small-group instruction in ELA and in Math either through guided reading, literacy or 
math centers, or through direct instruction. ELL/SWDs are involved in project-based learning in their instructional program 
across multiple content areas and receive instruction that uses multisensory techniques in instruction. Criteria used to place 
ELLs-SWDs in ICT classes includes progress reports in order to determine if this subgroup has met IEP goals, ELA and Math 
portfolio analysis by the Child Study team, state and local assessment data, and qualitative report from teachers delivered to 
the Child Study Team team. These criteria are evaluated by the Child Study team under the supervision of the principal.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
For ELLs in ELA, Math, Social Studies, and Science, targeted interventions are offered for all students, but are focused mainly 
on students performing in the lowest third, which includes ELLs with disabilities and ELLs at beginning and intermediate levels 
of proficiency. These interventions include at-risk services where applicable, Fundations phonics programs, additional small-
group literacy and math instruction from the classroom teacher or the ENL teacher. Other targeted interventions include 
multi-sensory instructional techniques in literacy, math, and in other content areas. Students receiving targeted intervention 
have their progress measured at regular intervals. In addition,  their classwork and assessments are analyzed by groups of 
teachers in grade-level meetings and in collaborative planning sessions with the ENL teacher and/or with related service 
providers. The ELLs' native language is used when applicable and if necessary for interventions in ELA, Math, Science, and 
Social Studies.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Based on data and trends, next year we will be implementing a new rigorous, teacher-created math curriculum by using many 
different programs as a foundation.  In addition, we will have an arts program that will include Drama, Dance, and Chorus.  Our 
ELLs and student body will benefit from a new Social Emotional Learning Program supported by our new Conflict Resolution 
Specialist. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Our school did not have a bilingual program because we do not have 12 English Language Learners with the same home 
language in one grade or two consecutive grades. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELLs are offered the same levels of access to all school programs, which are offered by choice to all applicable grades or age 
levels.  After-school supplemental services are offered through Title III for all eligible ELLs and to former ELLs as necessary. The 
after-school ENL program is aligned to CCLS and to our ELA and Math school instruction.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Instructional materials used to support ELLs include authentic literature and informational text for ELA instruction and for 
social studies and science instruction. Leveled readers are used for small-group guided reading instruction for all ELLs in all 
classrooms and during ENL. Manipulatives and other sensory materials and realia are used to support ELA, Math, and other 
content area instruction. Leveled science and social studies readers support content area instruction for all ELLs in all 
classrooms.  I-Ready is used to support ELA and Math instruction for ELLs and are accessed in school and at home. Other media 
technology supports include Kakooma as a supplemental support in Math.  Other instructional materials include Readers' 
Theatre kits and science lab instructional materials for use during ENL and in general and special education classrooms. Science 
materials include levelled science readers, authentic science non-fiction texts for use as curricular instruction, science 
manipulatives such as rocks/minerals kits, plant kits, magnifiers and other measurement tools. Social studies materials include 
levelled readers, authentic social studies CCLS-aligned non-fiction texts, photographs and other realia, as well as library media 
resources for research.  In addition to other resources deemed academically appropriate and accessible by our ENL Provider to 
help our ELLs acquire the English Language. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language support is offered in ENL through the use of bilingual dictionaries for all applicable home languages, through 
the use of bilingual literature and bilingual content in printed material. Home language support is offered where applicable 
through oral interpretation by The Language Translation and Interpretation Unit and Language Line, staff members or the ENL 
teacher, where appropriate. Written translation is offered where necessary through the use of The Language Translation and 
Interpretation Unit, bilingual dictionaries, or through bilingual glossaries for science and math content, for all ELLs in the 
general or special education classroom as needed.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  
Required services and resources support and correspond to ELLs' grades, ages, and levels of development through their 
alignment with Common Core Learning standards, levels of proficiency, and developmental appropriateness.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our school does not share a building.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Newly enrolled English Language Learners are offered a school tour before the start of the year or prior to registration, as 
needed. Newly enrolled ELLs and their parents also meet with the ENL teacher and Parent Coordinator,  under the supervision 
of the principal in order to explain programs and services and to address questions and concerns. In addition, newly enrolled 
ELLs are also paired with a buddy from the school community who may offer assistance in getting adjusted to school routines, 
classroom expectations, and in making friends.   Newly enrolled ELLs and their families are also given community information 
on neighborhood resources such as the NY Public Library, the Riverdale Y and other community-based supports and 
organizations. Information for newly enrolled ELLs is provided in the native language when applicable and with the assistance

of written translation or oral interpretation where necessary.  In addition, our school website can be translated into 104 
languages.    
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

At this moment we do not offer language electives at our school. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The professional development plan for the 2017-2018 and 2018 -2019 school years includes breakdown of the Language 
Acquisition Process with samples of student abilities at each proficiency level, Language Translation and Interpretation Services 
including using Language Line, and Co-Teaching Models, as a way to increase effective teaching for all English Language 
Learners.   
Other professional development for teachers of ELLs will include working with the Testing coordinator to analysis data and 
determine specific academic needs for ELLs in literacy and Math in order to target and improve specific skills. 
Professional development offered to staff who work with ELLs, including the ENL teacher, as ELLs engage in CCLS includes work 
with the Danielson Framework in order to analyze the various components in order to create individual professional 
development plans that meet the needs of all students especially ELLs.  Teachers receive planning time before the start of the 
year, weekly on Mondays, and during weekly grade meetings.  During this planning time, teachers examine student work, 
student data, Danielson framework data from observations, and other forms of data and assessment in order to determine 
ways in which CCLS-aligned curriculum can best meet the needs of ELLs.  In addition to other professional development 
deemed necessary by the instructional Cabinet to create high leverage performance tasks aligned to our curriculum.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Training will include work with the Danielson Framework as a way of improving instruction and differentiating instruction for 
ELL's. Special education teachers receive these hours at the start of the school year, at professional days, at the end of the 
year, and at regular meetings throughout the school year by the ENL teacher under the supervision of the principal. Records 
are maintained by the ENL teacher under supervision of the principal by keeping copies of meeting agendas and attendance 
for each PD. Records are also maintained by the school administration's filing of agendas, attendance, and meeting minutes for 
all professional development, as well as copies of agendas and attendance kept on file with the ENL teacher. Professional 
development takes place on Monday's, Tuesday's as well as during grade level meetings and other opportunities during the 
school year that take place both inside and outside of PS 24.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The ENL teacher and classroom teacher jointly identify individual goals for English Language Learners.  Parents are always 
invited and encouraged to meet with ENL, classroom and cluster teachers during Tuesdays' Parental Engagement. In addition, 
parents are always welcomed and have access to teachers via telephone, email, or in person whenever they have questions or 
concerns regarding their child's learning or progress.  For the incoming school year, our school will use School Messenger to 
reach out to all households. This messenger system allows parents and care-givers to translate the messages to the language 
of their choice.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Parents of ELLs are involved in all aspects of school life at PS 24, and there is an active Parent Association. Parents are provided 
with informational workshops and events on all programs, including ENL programming and policies for ELLs. Parents of ELLs are 
invited to all curriculum and related workshops conducted at our school. Letters and surveys are sent home to inform parents 
of new initiatives and programs. Parents of ELLs receive additional support through workshops provided for them throughout 
the school year on working with ELLs in content areas, and in transitioning to middle school. These particular parent 
workshops are designed to foster home-school connections and guide parents in best ways of helping their children achieve 
second language proficiency in English.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Steven Schwartz, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Data and methodologies used to assess the written translation and oral interpretation needs of parents is 
determined by analysis of Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey, Student Emergency Contact Cards, 
surveys conducted by the school, and informal reports from classroom teachers, school administration, our 
Language Access Coordinator/Parent Coordinator, and the ENL Teacher. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

For the incoming school year, our school will use School Messenger to reach out to all households. This messenger 
system allows parents and care-givers to translate the messages to the language of their choice. Additionally, any 
documents that are "back-packed" home are translated either from the DOE website or we use our PA to support us 
in translating into any language of the parents choice (use of families in the neighborhood who speak/write in that 
language).

Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Our professional development plan for the 2017-2018 school year includes a review of Chancellor's Regulation  
A-663, use of the Language Translation and Interpretation Services, and a training on the use of Language Line which will be co-provided by our 
Field Language Access Coordinator. These professional development sessions will take place in early fall.  
 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

          Limited-English Proficient parents will be made aware of their right to receive information in their native 
language through the use of flyers and/or our School Messenger service which instantly translates a voice message or 
document into the language of their choice. In addition, the information will be expressed at every parent 
engagement event. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Our school will gather feedback from limited-English-proficient parents on the language services they receive through 
the use of parent surveys (provided in their native language), and communication with our Language Access 
Coordinator/Parent Coordinator, ENL Teacher and Classroom teacher (through Language Line) to assure the quality 
and availability of all services and accommodations that are available. We will use their feedback to improve our 
language services in the areas the parents indicate we are lacking.
