Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Mission - It is our mission that all 141K students will be active participants in their learning. Their road to 
independence with us will be paved through exposure to college and career readiness skills leading them to further 
independence.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
We are a school serving 364 students in grades Pre-K (Age 3) through Grade 11. The school population comprises 47% 
black, 34% Hispanic, 14% white and 4% Asian students. The student body includes 21% English language learners and 
100% special education students. Boys account for 68% of the students enrolled and girls account for 32%. The 
average attendance rate for the year 2016-2017 was 84.4%. To date our 2017-2018 attendance rate is 85.4%. 

Vision - We at 141K value the voice of our students. We are inspired by what our students share, and we want them 
to be heard at all times. Each day students will be given opportunities to make a choice and use their voice 
throughout all of their learning experiences and daily interactions. Students will share their opinions and ideas with 
others. They will share what they learned and what they know. They will show their independence and have a voice in 
their learning. This vision will be evident in a safe, trusting, risk-free environment. We as educators and facilitators will 
make instructional decisions to provide our students access to choice and voice, and we will highlight their learning 
and growth throughout our professional learning communities. 

This year we continued our partnership with our collocated schools. At our MS35 site, students participate in several 
gym classes together, working with same-age peers to foster social interaction and increase the visibility and advocacy 
of students with disabilities. At our P380 site, students push in to general education art classes. At our MS2 site, 
students have participated in counseling sessions with same-age peers to help foster the discussion about acceptance, 
diversity, and self-advocacy. Students from all schools also attended school celebrations to support one another. A 
team of teachers at IS71 has applied for a DOE grant to develop a club for students to discuss social strategies, anti-
discrimination and acceptance with their peers. During the 2018-19 school year, at our MS2 campus, we will 
participate in a District-Charter Partnership program to foster a connection between the three collocated schools at 
this campus. The grant to fund the program was awarded by the Office of Campus Governance. 

P141K has a strong partnership with Material for the Arts, and this year, worked to expand our sustainability project 
and educational program. The school now has two school gardens and is working on expanding more. We applied for 
a SunWorks project to create hydroponic garden labs for our science program. This year we also partnered to bring 
CookShop to classes at our MS35 site and will continue the program with ten classes next year. 

This year, P141K implemented a new arts and movement program designed to provide students with opportunities to 
have special classes for movement, self-advocacy and healthy living, art, dance and music. The work done in these 
classes was celebrated through Arts Explosion Celebrations. This program will continue next year and will incorporate 
a new curriculum aligned to the New York Blueprint for the Arts and Career Development and Occupational Studies 
Standards. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The school serves students in six different ratios. All students, with the exception of some students in inclusion, 
participate in alternate assessment. Students are 12:1:4, 12:1:1, 6:1:1, 8:1:1, 8:1:2 for Pre-K,and inclusion for middle 
and high school. Each student has a severe disability and may be recommended for related services which include 
speech, occupational therapy, physical therapy, Counseling, itinerant hearing, vision and mobility services.  

We have made every effort to allow for a whole team approach with our students. Related service providers are 
assigned to work and collaborate with whole classes to provide opportunities for push-in services throughout the day 
so that related service providers and classroom staff can share strategies and tools. This also allow for greater 
opportunities for generalization and demonstrates to students that strategies can be used across settings and with a 
variety of people.  

We continue to stress the importance of students to have a voice in their learning and choices throughout their lives. 
This past year, students participated in a new arts, advocacy and health program that will continue and expand next 
year. One component of this program is to increase student awareness of health issues and to teach students to

advocate for themselves. This program is celebrated during the P141K Arts Explosion assemblies, which provide 
students with an opportunity to share their growth with their families and peers.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Student achievement was an area of celebration for us this year. We continue to see consistent growth in New York 
State assessments (Formative Assessment of Standards Task and the Student Annual Needs Determination inventory. 
We also continue to implement the First Author Writing Assessment and the school-created Reading Development 
Inventory. In addition to the continuation of these assessments, the school is also working to create a set of 
assessments for math. Cluster teachers in math have been working to develop pre- and post-assessment tasks that 
will allow them to track student progress across the year using a consistent assessment tool across all sites. This will 
allow for benchmark assessments every six weeks in line with the assessments done for reading and writing. 

The area of effective school leadership and supportive environment was an area of growth for the school this past 
year. The introduction of a new administrative structure provided two instructional assistant principals and two 
administrative assistant principals. This allowed for a more cohesive message related to curriculum and classroom 
instruction. The result was improved instructional practice as measured by the ADVANCE measures of teacher 
practice. Additionally, through our internal school surveys and Root Cause Analysis with staff members, staff indicated 
that additional professional development was needed to support access and communication for students. This was 
linked to the instructional focus on developing questioning and discussion for all students. For the past five years we 
have used Caroline Musselwhite to provide professional development in the areas of speech, core language and 
communication and to continue to build capacity with new teachers and additional classroom populations. Ms. 
Musselwhite worked with new groups this year, and we will continue our partnership next year to continue 
supporting key teacher teams. We will also continue our new work with consultant Gretchen Hanser to provide 
communication access strategies for students with limited access to communication devices as requested by related 
service provider and classroom teacher teams. Funding will also be used to purchase specific programmatic devices to 
help foster additional communication and switch access for these learners. 

Collaborative teachers is an area of growth for the organization. This past year, teachers across sites worked in 
common planning groups to write unit plans for ELA units. This structure allowed for teachers to focus on breaking 
down and supporting standards. This spring, 25 teachers are participating on the curriculum team to review and 
refine the curriculum, including adding additional objectives and three levels of student access to tasks. This will also 
be a key area of focus for next year. We plan to refine the inquiry process in teacher teams, focusing on the growth 
and assessment of these objectives. Teachers will work together to create new assessments for ELA Listening and 
Learning and will utilize these assessments to inform teacher practice. Teachers will also be given the opportunity to 
participate in inter-visitation cohorts to further support this level of collaboration.  

A second area of focus is strong family-community ties. We have made progress in having families participate in IEP 
meetings and conferences, but would like to further support these connections by increasing opportunities for parent 
training and workshops. Additional, we are also looking to increase opportunities for other community connections. 
The school-based-option vote this year included a session time with family engagement and professional 
development on Friday afternoons. These sessions will provide more varied opportunities for parents to participate in 
school activities and to work with the school in establishing consistent strategies between home and school.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
This year, rigorous instruction was a focus of professional development, and the school continued to work on 
improving the consistency of instruction across all classes. Each teacher received three full days of professional 
development plus time was spent during Chancellor’s Conference Days to review curriculum.  

 

The P141K curriculum was expanded to include consistent structures in reading assessment and instruction with a 
school-based assessment linked to the EngageNY Reading Skills Strand in the standards. Structures were also 
reviewed and refined for math, ELA listening and Learning and writing.  

 

Teachers showed improvements in practice in all domains as evidenced by observations in the ADVANCE Framework. 
Following is the breakdown of scores for all four domains for 2017-18: 

 

Domain 1 Planning and Preparation 

1.72% HE, 87.10% E, 10.97% D, 0.22% IE 

 

This domain is up from only 72% effective 2017-18 

 

Domain 2 Classroom environment 

6.42% HE, 91.86% E, 1.71% D 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

This domain is up from 83% effective 2017-18 

 

Domain 3 Instruction 

0.73% HE, 79.88% E, 19.10% D, 0.29% IE 

 

This domain is up from 64% effective 2017-18 

 

Domain 4 Professional Responsibilities 

11.89% HE, 86.34% E, 1.76% D 

 

 

Students showed growth on assessments including the Formative Assessment of Standards Task. On this assessment, 
87.6% of students showed growth. 

 

The area of instruction that continues to need support is using assessments in instruction. In this area, 25.89% of 
ratings were developing in teacher observations and only 72.32% were effective. This is improved from last year, 
where 57% of ratings were effective. It is a consistent area of need as highlighted by ADVANCE ratings, as well as from 
conversations during End of Year Conferences with teachers.  

 

During the 2017-18 school year, the focus of inquiry team meetings was reviewing practices and goals in IEPs for 
students. In the 2018-19 school year, the focus will be on reviewing assessments and using them to adjust 
instructional practice. This will also be addressed in teacher professional development.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
 

By the end of the 2018-19 school year, overall teacher ratings for Advance Domain 3 will increase to a minimum of 85% 
effective and a maximum of 15% developing or ineffective as measured by formal and informal observations entered 
into the Advance Framework for teaching

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Supportive environment is an area of strength based on the New York City School survey. Providing challenging work 
that addresses student needs and making students feel safe in the classroom are priorities. Instructional practices in 
this area have continued to show growth. 86% of teachers indicated that students advocate for themselves, 75% say 
that teachers use behaviors as a social emotional teaching tool, and 100% of teachers indicated that they feel safe.  

 

Parents also indicated that students are supported. 94% of parents indicated that they regularly see student work and 
96% say teachers communicate performance. 

 

A priority area of need is continually supporting growth in a culturally responsive teaching environment. This is 
increasingly important with the growing number of students moving to less restrictive environments within our 
organization. Currently the school implements a Positive Behavior Intervention and Support program (PBIS) to provide 
a framework for positive expectations for students. However, in the school survey 55% of teachers indicated that 
students regularly follow rules and 35% indicate that students always pay attention. Improving the PBIS program and 
reviewing its implementation in each class will help address some of these inconsistencies.  

 

In addition to PBIS, parent open houses were held this year to show parents student work in the classroom that can 
extend to the home. This included behavioral expectations as well. Furthermore, parents had the opportunity to join 
ClassDojo, where teachers can share student growth with pictures and videos through an app.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By the end of the school year, the SHINE PBIS program will have consistent implementation in all classrooms and be 
shared with families as evidenced by a school-generated implementation rubric for parents and teachers that 
measures the participation of students in the SHINE program.

development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Collaborative teachers was a highlight during the 2017-18 school year. This year, 11.89% of teacher observation 
ratings in 4e (professional development and collaboration) were highly effective and 86.34% were effective. All 
teachers participated in common planning teams and submitted unit plans as a group. Additionally, all teachers 
participated in three full-day professional development sessions geared toward specific grade bands, allowing 
teachers to collaborate across all four sites.  

During the spring, two teachers stepped into the role of Instructional Support Teachers. These teachers provided 
opportunities for inter-visitations and shared best practices with teachers at all four sites.  

Another highlight was the curriculum team. 25 teachers volunteered to work on the curriculum team after school. The 
teams reviewed and refined curriculum for each grade band.  

Based on the 2017-18 Quality Review report, an area of focus was developing an inquiry process for teachers. This 
area was rated proficient. Teachers currently review assessment results based on IEPs, however, a greater focus will 
be placed on instructional assessments for day-to-day activities in the classroom.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019,school year, all teachers will increase as measured by the overall ratings for Advance observations in 
domain 3d to a minimum of 82% effective or higher ratings.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

This year, the administrative cabinet went through significant structural changes, shifting the roles of assistant 
principals and introducing instructional support teachers. This allowed for consistent feedback and professional 
development for teachers. This also allowed for opportunities of distributive leadership across sites. The results were 
positive as evidenced by the NYC school survey: 

94% of families indicated that the principal was committed to shared decision making. 96% of teachers indicated that 
the principal set high expectations, 85% said there was a clear vision and 84% indicated that there were clear 
expectations for implementing strategies giving in professional development. 

Addressing consistency across all four school sites and improving student behavioral standards is an area of need. 
According to the survey 67% of teachers indicated they had influence of instructional materials used in their 
classroom, 69% indicated that there was coordination of learning materials, and 68% of teachers indicated that they 
had influence over standards for student behavior.  

There is a shift in parental view versus teacher view of input when it comes to the school vision. The teachers voices 
need to be heard more fluently within the systems that we use. The structure of global teams and the sharing of 
supports will lend to this continuity in voice of the school. Teams will reach out to parents on a larger scale feeling 
more connected to the school vision. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By the end of the 2018-19 school year, the overall instructional consistency will improve as measured by teacher 
responses on the 2019 NYC School Survey report with at least 82% positive responses in the area of Effective School 
Leadership relating to these components.

This year, P141K continued holding open houses for parents. In addition, parents were invited to four Arts Explosion 
Assemblies designed to celebrate student work with the arts clusters at each site. Parent attendance at these events 
was inconsistent, but parents were enthusiastic about the opportunity.  

 

Title III weekend academy continued its structure of inviting parents to attend trips and events to practice 
communication strategies with their students. 15 families participated in these events.  

 

Currently, P141K has 121 parents connected on ClassDojo, a platform for sharing electronic communication, pictures 
and videos between the school and home.  

 

Parent-Classroom communication is a strength. 93% of families indicated on the NYC school survey that they receive 
regular outreach form the school, and 96% felt they were well informed by communication sent home. 94% of 
teachers indicated that they work closely with families to ensure success of the students.  

 

An area of need is increased parent participation in school workshops and opportunities to collaborate with the 
school.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 141K, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS 141K will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSA/State accountability 
system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning 
Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
For the 2018-19 school year, there are 69 ELL students who are all in alternate assessment. The 
ELL population (69 is 19.7% of the total school population of 351). Methods of determining 
English language proficiency and/or English language skills include the NYSESLAT, NYSAA, 
DLM and SANDI/FAST.  The Title III Saturday program will take place using two groups of 
students. One class will include 6 students from 6:1:1 grade K-2 classes. The second class will 
include 12 students from 12:1:1 grade 3-5 classes. The classes will be staffed with one bilingual 
paraprofessional and one content teacher. A bilingual certified speech teacher will support in 
both classes. The program will address New Language arts progressions, ELA and appropriate 
Next Generation Learning Standards via school-based themes. The bilingual paraprofessionals 
will be provided in each class to maintain student ratios (6:1:1 and 12:1:1). The content teachers 
will be assigned to reinforce the integrated model for ENL. The bilingual certified speech teacher 
will provide communication support in both classrooms and help model language acquisition 
strategies. One Assistant Principal will be provided because our supplemental instruction occurs 
on Saturday and an administrator is needed to be present to ensure that all compliance and 
instructional requirements are being met. Students and parents will be asked to pre-register so 
that we can anticipate the needs of attendees. The Title III Saturday Program at P141K will occur 
on 6 Saturdays throughout the 2018-2019 school year from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m, two each 
month (2 in March, 2 in April, 2 in May). Student instruction will be provided during this time. 
There will be six instructional sessions for students, of five hours each, while parents observe 
and learn to facilitate communication and instructional strategies. Instructional sessions will 
include community trips to model communication for students and families. Trips will include 
local markets, the library, two museums and the New York Aquarium. On these Saturdays, 
parents will accompany their child to the school site, PS380 by 10:00 a.m. and leave by 3:00 
p.m. Each parent and their child who attend will receive a $5.50 Metro Card for transportation 
and admission to the aquarium for one parent and the student. These students were invited to 
attend the Saturday Academy upon analyzing the 2018 NYSESLAT results.  This group 
performed in the entering level of  English language proficiency and require additional support in 
all four domains (Speaking, listening, reading and writing). The language of instruction will be 
English with support from the bilingual certified speech teachers and bilingual paraprofessionals. 
Interpreters for the Parent involvement will be provided on an as needed basis. The P141K Title 
III program name is "Community-Based Trips and Advocacy." Activities planned for students 
will supplement the curriculum and will be aligned with their individual needs based on the IEP 
and cognitive levels. The supplemental instructional services will focus on language 
development in English, in math and other core areas based on individual student needs using the 
integrated ENL model. Materials used will be differentiated and adapted to meet individual 
students’ goals as stated on their IEP.  For example, augmentative communication devices will 
be programmed to reflect responses pertaining to that day’s lesson, as well as the use of, Core 45 
boards, vocabulary flip books, visual schedules, and PECs books. Writing tasks will be adapted

and student’s verbal responses will be recorded by teachers or paraprofessionals to foster 
comprehension. Students will also benefit from Native language support given by bilingual 
paraprofessionals and teachers as well as the use of augmentative communication devices. In 
addition students will further develop their literacy skills by reading/listening to the books found 
within the EngageNY ELA curriculum, DiscoveryEducation.com, tarheelreader.org, and various 
library books. This will supplement and build on the skills in the classroom and provide students 
with ENL and communication strategies that can generalize to other academic tasks.  With 
assistance and guidance from the teachers and paraprofessionals students will learn about the 
NYC resource centers, libraries and cultural institutions, build vocabulary and background 
knowledge to enhance comprehension and reading, and develop communication to increase self-
advocacy skills.

The three hours of professional development for staff participating in the Title III program will 
occur during two sessions, 1.5 hours each for a total of 3 hours, offered after school 3:00 – 4:30 
PM, during the 2018-2019 school year, at PS380, 370 Marcy Ave. Brooklyn, NY 11206. The 
certified bilingual speech teacher will conduct the professional development workshops. 
Participants will include an assistant principal, bilingual certified speech teacher, 2 content 
teachers, and the 2 paraprofessionals who will be participating in the Title III supplemental 
program. The assistant principal's regular day ends at 3:30, but he/she will be paid for 1 hour for 
each professional development session as specified in the budget. He/she will still participate in 
the PD starting at 3:00, but will only be paid by Title III from 3:30-4:30 PM. Two workshops 
will be offered in March 2019. During the first professional development workshop in March we 
will discuss how students will utilize communication tools, alternate pencils for writing, and 
access to discussion strategies. During the second PD, we will discuss the use of activity-specific 
vocabulary building, words-we-know books, and memory books to support text-to-self and text-
to-world connections to foster comprehension strategies for ENL students. As a result of the 
workshops, participants will expand their knowledge on techniques that can be implemented in 
teaching ENL students with special needs

parents with their child will be included. Additionally, parents will receive reminder letters and 
phone calls as the dates for workshops approach and bilingual paraprofessionals will be available 
to assist parents with their native language needs. Parent Involvement activities will take place 
from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM. From 10:00-10:30 an administrator will provide a workshop for 
parents each week that will orient them to the instructional strategies and communication 
techniques their students will be using. A facilitated observation will then take place where 
parents have the opportunity to see communication strategies and direct instruction and work 
alongside their students. Parents will attend the community trip with their students and from 
2:30-3:00 the group will debrief with staff members and discuss ways that the techniques can be 
used at home. Parent Coordinator, Pat Lysius,  will make written materials about Title III, and 
the ENL program, available in various languages as well as to provide native language 
assistance. All participants in the program will receive photos of the students participating during 
sessions.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
All ELL students at P141K,  are in alternate assessment. At P141K, we use the NYSAA, FAST and the SANDI assessment with our 
students, including the ELLs to assess early literacy skills . The FAST and SANDI are hand scored by the teacher who works with 
the student. The FAST and SANDI assess a continuum of skills. They contain observable traits referred to as academic 
characteristics. These assessment results are very helpful to the classroom teacher from one year to the next as it can describe 
the academic functioning level of the student in a classroom setting. The results of the assessments will also inform the 
pedagogues  as to how to adjust the instructional plan to meet each students individual needs.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

Structures in place such as common planning periods allow for integrated lesson planning with classroom teachers and review 
of student data to support instructional decisions during professional option periods. Annual meetings about student progress 
address the interventions for students based on the formative assessments.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of the programs for ELLs is assessed during the NYSESLAT which is given each spring. In addition, the ENL students 
will be assessed once each quarter with a teacher made checklist that addresses the goals on the IEP for each child. Such 
checklists evaluate each students individual skills and needs and the teacher will direct instruction to meet the needs of each 
student. Through student results in SANDI, NYSESLAT and NYSAA we evaluate the success of our programs. Note that the 
NYSESLAT, which is NY State's English Language Proficiency (ELP) assessment for all ELL students, is not appropriate to 
determine progress made by students with severe disabilities because it is a standardized test, and is being administered to 
students who, by definition, do not take standardized tests, but rather alternate assessments. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Common planning periods allow for integrated lesson planning with classroom teachers based on the review of student data, 
including the results of SANDI, FAST, NYSESLAT and quarterly benchmark checklists. Annual meetings about student progress 
address the interventions for students based on the assessments.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Our school uses data from the NYSESLAT, NYSAA, FAST  and SANDI assessments to guide instruction for ELLs within the 
Response to Intervention framework. We add 3 layers of intervention and instructional support to the standard core 
curriculum based on the needs of our students. Tier 1 provides instructional strategies that benefit all students. Tier 2 and 3 
provide more direct interventions based on needs determined by the language assessments. Tier 2 supports are provided 
during push-in instruction and integrated lessons planned with classroom teachers. Tier 3 supports are provided during pull-
out sessions and target needs determined by assessments and in conjunction with teaching team observations.  Research 
based intervention strategies such as differentiation and scaffolding will be incorporated into the students program as needed. 
As students academically progress we examine data from the assessments, the supports will be minimized as needed  so that 
the students may become independent learners. For at-risk ELLs in grades 6-8, the following academic interventions are 
implemented at our school, 141K: After-school enrichment program, Title III Saturday Academy, buddy system (mono-
lingual peer is paired with incoming ENL student), alternate placement paraprofessional in students' native language. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
All ELLs participate in the NYSESLAT exam in the spring of each school year and this test  is used to evaluate the ELL programs 
and aid in planning and instruction. As we examine the patterns across the four NYSESLAT modalities, speaking is the strongest 
followed equally by listening, then  reading and finally writing.  The results of the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT indicate a 
consistency of scores, meaning that most of the students are at the Entering and Emerging level .  The reason most students 
are scoring at the entering and emerging level is that the testing tools (NYSITELL and NYSESLAT) are standardized tests, while 
most of the students are alternate assessment students, whose English language abilities cannot be properly determined using 
a standardized assessment.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

ENL teachers have access to data and can view the NYSESLAT scores by looking at the following ATS reports : 
RLAT (NYSESLAT scores modality breakdown) and REXH (Exam History report). When planning lessons, ENL teachers will 
examine the results of the NYSESLAT and plan to teach students the skills that require remediation as evidence from the data. 
ENL teachers share the results of these assessments during annual meetings with IEP teams and during common planning 
periods when integrated lessons are planned.

Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The ENL program at P141K is an integrated/stand-alone model. Our ENL program is composed of 79 ELLs, all of whom 
are assessed using the NY State Alternate Assessment (NYSAA).  Of the 79 students who are ELLs, 16 have IEP's that 
request a bilingual class. Students who have an IEP mandate of bilingual instruction, and for whom no such placement 
exists in the school, are placed in a monolingual class with an alternate placement paraprofessional who speaks their 
home language and English, and are provided with mandated ENL services. Each student is served according to their 
IEP.  When creating ENL groups, the ELLs are grouped heterogeneously, but no more than three years difference in 
chronological age.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Currently P141K only features ENL program. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Currently P141K only features ENL program. 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

 Students will be grouped according to English Language proficiency based on their score obtained on the NYSESLAT.  Group 
size will be maximized while maintaining student staff ratios specified on each students IEP. Our school makes every effort to 
deliver the most instructional minutes to each students based on their obtained NYSESLAT score. With four sites and two 
teachers, the teachers travel to each site to deliver ENL instruction to ELL students. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
For all students, content area is provided as follows: all subject areas are taught in English through ENL methodologies by 
Special Education teachers who have completed the mandated 10 hours of Jose P. ENL training. The ENL methodologies used 
include: TPR, Language Experience, the Natural Approach, and graphic organizers, multi-sensory approaches used in 
conjunction with augmentative communication devices, Mayer Johnson symbols, and Scaffolding Techniques. Content Area 
Instruction follows the CCLS. The use of technology and augmentative communication devices paired with Mayor Johnson 
symbols, computer programs, adapted switches and F.A.C.E.S. curriculum are incorporated to give students in Alternate 
Assessment additional instructional support. Multi-sensory and multicultural materials are infused throughout all aspects of 
instruction.      
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Our ELL students are currently only evaluated in English. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE

e. 

Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Instruction is differentiated for ELLs with disabilities and more adapted books need to be added to the classroom libraries. 
Literacy in the students’ native language plays a role in instruction considering students are offered the use of bilingual picture 
dictionaries, native language reading materials and alternate placement paraprofessionals for students whose IEP 
recommends bilingual instruction. Students will continue to receive support and reinforcement of their expressive and 
receptive language. PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System) and the AAC (Alternative Communication Devices) will 
continue to be used by students in accordance with their IEP. Students who no longer require bilingual or ENL services based 
upon a score of proficient on the NYSESLAT will be supported for two years with ENL/AIS services. Students will be offered 
bilingual counseling and bilingual speech therapy, as indicated on their IEP. AIS services, participation in clubs, such as student 
government will be offered as well.  
Currently we have 51 newcomers and they will receive tutoring, a buddy student, development of initial literacy in native 
language, and a nurturing environment to facilitate language production. The classroom teacher will be offered additional 
support and continuous consultations with the ENL teacher. Students will be offered bilingual counseling and bilingual speech 
therapy, as indicated on their IEP. AIS services, Title III Saturday Academy program and participation in clubs, such as student 
government will be offered to SIFE students. ELLs continue to receive support and reinforcement of their expressive language 
development through the use of Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) and their receptive language development 
through the use of Goosen’s Aided Language Stimulation, ALS, (integrates symbols into daily classroom and group activities). 
Overall, communication skills are addressed through other forms of Augmentative and Alternate Communication (AAC) 
systems.  
At this time we do not have SIFE students, but if and when we do we will offer communication in the Native Language in both 
written and verbal form, mandated ENL services, a buddy system, peer tutoring, and Title III Saturday Academy to each 
student.  
Students characterized Developing ELLs have been receiving ENL services for a time more than 3 years, but less than 6(4-6 
years). At this time we have 37  Developing ELL students and 0 Long term ELLs, serving 7 years or more.  Developing ELLs will 
be supported with services from an ENL teacher, and instruction will be provided to coincide with the students IEP goals and 
objectives.  At P141K, ELL students receive an extension of services for ENL until they score proficiently on the NYSESLAT.   
At P141K, ELL students receive an extension of services for ENL due to their individual and specific education needs. Two fully 
certified ENL teachers provide support and academic intervention to these students for at least 150 minutes per week. These 
teachers use various ENL methodologies, such as: Total Physical Response (TPR), Language Experience Approach (LEA), graphic 
organizers, and manipulatives such as Mayer Johnson picture symbols to represent words and actions.  
Students who no longer require bilingual or ENL services based upon a score of commanding on the NYSESLAT will be 
supported for two years with ENL/AIS services. Students will be offered bilingual counseling and bilingual speech therapy, as 
indicated on their IEP. AIS services, participation in clubs, such as student government will be offered as well. The use of ENL 
strategies, scaffolding, classroom libraries in English, as well as the use of NLAP (New Language Arts Progressions), are all an 
integral part of the instruction of our ELLs.  
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
To ensure that students meet the standards and pass the required state and local assessments, ENL instruction will follow the 
NLAP as well as the CCLS and incorporate ENL strategies such as: Total Physical Response (TPR), Language Experience, 
Scaffolding Techniques, and graphic organizers. The use of technology and augmentative communication devices are 
incorporated to give students additional instructional support. Multi-sensory and multicultural ENL materials are infused 
throughout all aspects of instruction. Some materials are teacher made that address the students’ cultural backgrounds. The 
classroom library includes a variety of books of all student levels that reflect the background, needs and strengths of ELLs. The 
use of technology i.e. a computer, digital camera, recording devices, etc., will be incorporated to give the students additional 
instructional support. Additionally, the teacher will use informal methods (observations) of assessment to keep record of the 
students’ progress. If eligible, students will be administered the Spanish LAB to determine the proficiency of their native 
language. If English is not the parent’s preferred language, arrangements must be made for a bilingual social history. We will 
follow the Bilingual Cascade, which details the priority for selecting personnel to conduct bilingual assessments for students

whose native language is not English or Spanish.  
  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
P141K creates an individual academic intervention plan for ELL students’ success and achievement through consultation with 
the homeroom teachers, ENL teacher, related service providers and support staff.  students additional instructional support. 
Common planning, as provided through professional option periods, allows the team to address specific needs of ENL students 
in classroom instruction and allows for sharing of strategies to best support students in academic periods throughout the day. 
Instruction for ELLs is flexible and intended to provide support based on IEP needs as determined by the team.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
In ELA, students are provided homogeneous groupings for reading groups based on school-created reading development 
inventory (RDI), SANDI and FAST. ENL teachers support in these reading groups and provide additional materials to teachers. 
ENL students receive support during math, science and social studies as the ENL teacher integrates instruction during core 
content areas. Standalone sessions target vocabulary and strategies designed to support core content. 
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Based on previous NYSESLAT data, skill assessments such as the Reading Development Inventory (RDI) and both ENL teacher(s) 
and classroom teacher observations of student trends in context of their skill development, our school has implemented and 
will continue to improve on using specific sheltered learning techniques used specifically for English language learners with 
learning disabilities. Such techniques include the use of visual aids, encouraging students to expand and elaborate their 
responses to help develop oral language expression abilities and structuring oral input based on the students' level of 
understanding and current language skills. These sheltered learning techniques are streamlined and implemented into our 
latest, "First Author" Writing program that has been recently included within our English Language Arts curriculum to address 
low reading and writing skill trends determined from the aforementioned data. The "First Author" writing program, developed 
by Don Johnston, uses a series of scaffolds that provide language tools ( topic choice boards, sentence starters, etc) for 
students to freely express their thougts about student-selected topics and student generated writings. The program aids 
P141K's ability to support our focus on including more peer-assisted learning and interactions, which is beneficial for our 
English language Learners in providing opportunities to build language and social skills in both English and native language, 
when applicable with their peers. This program is continuously evaluated each year by reviewing students' writings and in-class 
oral discussions to determine what adjustments and/or improvements need to be made. This year, students are using the 
"First Author's" chair as a means for students to share their writings orally, but also give more opportunities for their peers to 
utilize listening skills to develop more questions around what is being shared orally. Such programs are aimed at addressing 
the four modalities of Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing for our ELLs and overall student body. Another new program 
implemented this year is our student-led school newspaper that provides opportunities for both our ELLs and Speech students 
to lead and organize topics and content to share with our student-body and parents. The aim is to expose our ELLs to multi-
literacies such as newspaper structures, researching and gathering information through oral interviews/social interaction, 
internet and books. Students are able to incorporate their funds of knowledge and cultural experiences as well as share their 
school experience through the newspaper in a fun way that theorectically lessens the affective filter when acquiring a new 
language. The newspaper is aimed at increasing parental involvement and aiding communication between the school, students 
and parents. Multiple departments such as Speech, Counseling, ENL and classroom teachers collaborate to support the 
students in completing sections of the newspaper, which is set to be sent home twice a year. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Our school has never had a bilingual program due to there not being enough bilingual students with the same language sharing 
a common grade/age band to create a class. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

ELLs are afforded equal access to information about all programs through the use of interpretative services and written 
communication offered in the ELLs' native language. Through the Federal Title III program grant, we are offering a Saturday 
program to ELLs and a workshop to parents of ELLs . Such workshops will be informative and interactive. Parents will 
participate in workshops to better assist their children at home with home work and topics learned at school, and students will 
have instructional classroom support by a certified ENL teacher. This program will invite all ELLs to participate in additional 
instruction for four hours per each Saturday. The sessions will have carefully designed lessons that address language 
acquisition and academic enrichment. ELLs will be invited to the program with a letter explaining the details, written in their 
native language as well as with a phone call in the native language to the home. The school at P141K invites all students to 
events and keeps them informed by communicating with the home in their native language via phone calls or written 
materials. In addition, AIS (Academic Intervention Services) will be offered before school to ELLs in need of more academic 
support. AIS for ELLs specifically, is implemented with the classroom teacher and ENL teacher's input on how to best address 
the students' needs. Strategies used during ENL instruction is also implemented during AIS. 
  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Instructional materials are created and chosen to address the language and core content skills needing development for each 
ELL and their subgroup. Technology, such as phoenic awareness videos that uses music, repetition and visuals for letter sound 
recognition are utilized on the IPAD and augmentative communication devices are incorporated to give students additional 
instructional support. Some specific support programs/apps used are abcya.com, Starfall, TarHeel reader and Have Fun 
Teaching videos and Foundations for ELLs for Entering and Emerging ELLs. Transitionong and Advancing ELLs may use a 
combination of Foundations for ELL materials, Brainpop ESL/Brainpop and Longman Cornerstone supports for ELLs. Multi 
sensory and multicultural ENL materials are infused throughout all aspects of instruction on all levels. Some materials are 
teacher made that address the students’ cultural backgrounds. The classroom library includes a variety of books of all student 
levels that reflect the background, needs and strengths of ELLs. During stand alone sessions, ELLs are instructed based on the 
key skills being taught in their core subject (primarily ELA) and their language goals. For example, if the classroom teacher's 
targeted content skill is comparing and contrasting two characters, the ENL stand alone sessions may utilize the students' 
personal likes such as Teenage Mutant Turtles and Batman and Robin (comic book/tv characters) to aid conceptual 
understanding of skill. Students may visually compare and contrast these familiar, student-generated characters displayed on a 
smartboard or photograph. ELLs practice comparing and contrasting using physical attributes and gain practice with 
distinguishing between the meaning of comparing and contrasting. Graphic organizers, such as Venn diagrams are utilized. 
Based on the ELLs level of conceptual understanding, the students may utilize a teacher-generated text on the two characters 
to compare and contrast their actions, traits and/or feelings and continue to build upon their skill level as the unit proceeds. 
Such an example would incorporate both curriculum texts and supplemental texts chosen by the ENL teacher to help support 
the ELLs in their learning. In this example, Language goals may include using comparitive language such as bigger, smaller, etc, 
which may require an anchor chart of comparitive language words/pictures to be visible throughout the unit as a teacher-
created visual aid. Essentially, instructional material is chosen based around individual students' langauge goals and targeted 
common core skill standards within the school curriculum. The ENL teachers create an individual academic intervention plan 
for ELL students’ success and achievement through consultation with the homeroom teachers, related service providers and 
support staff. The intervention plan is developed from the student's IEP and collaborative observations from school staff. It is 
implemented within class instruction as a means to meet student's academic and language goals listed in the IEP. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

P141K currently serves ELLs within an ENL program model.With the belief and theoretical backing that home language skills 
are transferrable to second language acquisition. Home language support is determined to be effective or non-effective based 
on the progress of a students' English Language proficiency level. Home language support is assessed within three major focus 
areas. The first is through specific ENL goals generated for each ELL annually, which becomes a part of the IEP document under 
measurable goals for mandated ENL services for each ELL. These goals are incorporated during group instruction in both stand 
alone and integrated ENL instruction. Instruction is designed to incorporate home language through culturally responsive texts 
and classroom resources that reflect the ELL and diverse  
student population. This includes bilingual short stories (primarily English and Spanish combinations) , supplemental videos 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

and texts that incorporate multi-cultural holidays, lifestyles and peer-interaction that provide opportunities for students to 
utilize home language and use transferable home language skills to acquire English language skills. The mastery of goals are 
assessed through daily tasks, class work, observations and are documented and kept in a binder of ELL portfolios that are 
maintained by the ENL teachers to track student progress in the four modalities of Reading, Speaking, Reading and Writing. 
Home language is also assessed through collaborative meetings and observable notes taken from service providers and 
classroom teachers related to students' language progress. These notes include social interactions within an academic setting 
and more social settings (recess), in-class work performance and any other concerns that are generated through the 
collaborative meetings. Meetings are typically held continuously at agreeable times for service providers and teachers, during 
teacher-planning periods. NYSESLAT levels is the last focus utilized to assess home language support and is used in 
collaboration with the aforementioned focus areas to determine what is needed to meet the ELL's individual needs, grouping 
during instruction and instruction delivery. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The required services and resources correspond to ELLs' age and grade levels by following the students' IEP recommendations 
and by following the Common Core Standards that are based on what skills students should be learning at their grade level and 
age. The delivery of the content is modified to meet the needs of the ELLs and considers their intellectual disability to target 
Common Core Standards in a way that is attainable for each student. ELL students are grouped heterogeneously for ENL 
classes based on their age and IEP classification and language needs. Students will only be placed in groups with peers whom 
are no more than 3 consecutive years in age difference, which is consistent with the IEP guidelines. In addition at P141K, most 
12:1:4 classes consist of students who are no more than one year apart, although for special education, this is not a 
requirement. Therefore it is insured that when the ENL teacher conducts a integrated session, all students are already grouped 
by grade level and are receiving grade-level instruction. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
P141K has four sites where all are in collocation with other schools. P141K generally maintains specific floors or designated 
areas where class instruction is held for each site. Instructional materials are not shared amongst schools in collocation and 
storage rooms for instructional materials and resources are maintained by individual schools. Each school in collocation 
maintains their school culture through the use of banners and other visual aids specific to the school vision and values to aid 
socio-emotional learning through maintaining a sense of community and school identity within a building of multiple schools. 
ELL students, primarily on the Entering level engage in a walk-through of the school to identify areas such as gym, water 
fountains, etc. Students identify areas that are not utilized by P141K and are instructed on social skills such as being 
considerate of noise level in the halls and speaking to both P141K students and staff and neighboring schools in passing, but 
not entering non-P141K classrooms or undesignated spaces. Schools have specific times that their students use shared spaces, 
such as gyms and cafeterias. Visual aids are used to label these common areas, such as at IS35, where words such as "gym" and 
a visual aid is posted near the area to aid all students linguistically. ENL teachers maintain professional relationships with other 
ENL teachers in collocation, when applicable, to ensure multiple means of accessing resources and support materials for all 
English language Learners. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Newly enrolled ELL students are able to participate in the Chapter 683 program and may receive tutoring, a buddy student, 
development of initial literacy in native language, and a nurturing environment to facilitate language acquisition with an ENL 
teacher. Parents of ELLs also receive consultation with our parent coordinator and are directed on resources to assist the 
family in preparing for the upcoming school year. The parent coordinator works with the ENL teachers to ensure language 
concerns are explored and communicated to help ensure neccessary, obtainable supports are in place before the school year 
begins. Classroom teachers are offered year-round support and continuous consultations with the ENL teachers through 
Chapter 683. When applicable, students are offered bilingual counseling and bilingual speech therapy, as indicated on their 
IEP. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
During the 2017-2018 school year, P141K’s in-house professional development plan for all staff including assistant  
principals, counselors, speech therapists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, teachers, paraprofessionals, secretaries, 
psychologists, family workers and school aides, who provide services to ELLs will be included in the following in-house PDs 
and will be used to maintain the 15% ELL-specific PD requirement for all teachers: Training on Culturally Responsive 
Instruction that includes best practices for co-teaching ELLs and Strategies for Teaching ELLs that include language acquisition, 
which are presented in collaboration with the ENL teachers, administration and Speech department. An attendance sheet will 
be maintained and stored in the school administrator's office. ENL teachers/Bilingual Teachers will utilize information from 
the following OELL District Professional Development courses they will attend, along with their professional insights to 
share amongst colleagues:  
 
Jose P Training offered by the district 75 OELL, will teach strategies and methods such as the delivery of TPR (Total 
Physical Response), scaffolding, the Language Experience Approach, and the development of graphic organizers. Staff 
participation will be recorded on form # 8 of the P141K ELL Compliance Document. Professional development instruction on 
The Language Experience Approach, Total Physical Response, Strategies and Materials for Alternate Placement Instruction, NYS 
ENL Standards, and The Adaptation of ENL Materials for the Education of ELLs with Severe Disabilities.  
 
The District 75 OELL PDs will be utilized as a means for attending staff to share methodologies, strategies and develop plans to  
address the needs of our ELL population with non-attending staff through inhouse PDs to ensure the PD hours outlined in CR  
Part 154 are obtained. Staff who provide services to ELLs will receive support as the students transition from one school level  
to another and they will also discuss student progress, familiy involvement and methodologies that work best for each student  
Records of attendance will be maintained through a staff sign in sheet which will be stored in the administrators office.  
ENL and bilingual teachers (if apllicable), will participate in professional workshops regarding the engagement of the CCLS by  
attending courses offered by the Dept of Education and its affiliates.  
 
ENL and bilingual teachers will participate in professional workshops regarding the engagement of the CCLS by attending 
courses offered by the Dept of Education and its affiliates along with helping facilitate in-house PDs. 
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
P141K utilizes both in-house PDs and District 75 OELL PDs to gather professional resources to share and instruct staff on best 
practices for instructing ELLS and current methodologies and strategies for language acquisition. Combinations of PDs

facilitated by the District 75 OELL and In-house PDs will allow P141K to meet the required professional development 
requirements outlined in CR Part 154.2. Records of attendance will be maintained through a staff sign in sheet which will be 
stored in the administrators office. At P141K we will provide professional development to all teachers and administrators that 
specifically addresses the needs of English language learners. A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional 
development hours for all teachers prescribed by CR Part 154 will be dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on 
best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English language learners. The 
bilingual and ENL teachers will attend professional development offered by the D75 Office of ELLs to achieve the 50% of total 
hour requirement. Records of attendance and agendas will be maintained through a staff sign in sheet which will be stored in 
the administrator's office. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Our school provides annual IEP meetings with parents to discuss the goals of the ENL program at which time 
language development progress, language proficiency results and language development needs in content areas are discussed. 
The ENL teacher is a member of the student's IEP team and participates to share information about each ELL student. 
Provisions for interpretation and translated are provided as needed to the parents. ENL teachers also utilizes and sends home 
continuation of service letters (in home language, when needed), Entitlement letters for newly identified ELLs and progress 
reports that identify if the student met their ENL goals. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

P141K facilitates Family engagement nights that include both social activities (such as movie night) and  
parent workshops on ways to support ELLs with disabilities along with other themes that our families may benefit 
from throughout the year. Such family engagement/parental involvement activities are facilitated in collaboration with the 
school's parent coordinator, administration, counselors, teachers, ENL and speech departments. P141K is currently seeking to 
design questionnaires that are either electronic or in paper-form to generate parent feedback as to the type of workshops that 
are most culturally-relevant and pertinent to the education of their child and their role as educational partners. Due to 
fluctuating parental involvement, P141K is requesting feedback from families in designing activities for the upcoming school 
year. Additional supports for families are provided during both Chapter 683, with ENL teachers working with newly enrolled 
ELLs and their families to help prepare for the upcoming school year by providing language resources and off-campus learning 
and language experiences. The student-led newspaper published twice a year also fosters parental involvement by 
communicating students' learning experiences, strategies for parents and upcoming events that the parents are welcomed to 
participate.  
Currently, P141K is in the process of including more targeted workshops for families of ELLs that address strategies for 
a multilingual household and/or families where the child is the primary English speaker. Additionally, the Parental component 
of the Title III program is designed to address the needs of parents of ELLs that are able to be a part of the program. For 
five Saturdays throughout the school year, parents are invited to a series of workshops conducted by Sinergia, Inc. and QSAC 
and the content is about developing strategies to foster the education of special needs ELL students. Materials are available 
in parent's Native language as well as interpreting services as needed.

1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided

choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
