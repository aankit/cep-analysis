Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Here at PS 156, our mission is to provide high quality instruction, an inclusive and challenging environment for all 
students that will give them the competitive edge to make a significant impact on the world.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

PS 156K is located in Brownsville, Brooklyn. Currently our school services 650 students. Most recently, we were 
recognized for our efforts around building a community of readers and putting systems in place to promote 
comprehension, fluency, vocabulary, phonics and phonemic awareness. We are pleased to announce that for the 
2018-2019 School Year we are a Showcase School.  

We are in year four as a UFT Community Learning School and an NYC Community School. OUr school is the recipient 
of the Attendance Intervention and Dropout Prevention (AIDP) grant. Through these initiatives we are able to offer 
services such as an in-house mental health provider from Interboro, UFT social worker, chess program, debate, 
culture club where students learn Spanish and about Latin culture, vision screening, free glasses, coats for students, 
school supplies. We also provided workshops at the nearby shelter and an annual community feast for Thanksgiving 
Day. Traditionally, we host our Fall Carnival to celebrate students and families and to provide opportunities for 
networking and support. Visit our school's webpage at www.ps156k.org to learn more about our school community. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our students in temporary housing is a population that needs school supplies, toiletries and school uniforms/clothing. 
We have approximately 150 students in temporary housing.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

During the past school year, according to our school quality snapshot, we have remained the same or decreased in 
some areas. One area of focus for this school year has been collaborative teachers. Every week, teachers of the same 
grade band meets for teacher team meetings. The weekly meetings are facilitated by one of our coaches or by one of 
the teachers. On Mondays, all teachers engage in professional development which is facilitated by a staff member or 
someone externally. Our teacher team meetings and Monday professional development are geared around best 
practices, looking at student work, planning, and mental health. During the 2018-2019 school year, during our teacher 
team meetings we will have a keen focus on analyzing student data, brainstorming next steps and reflecting on the 
implementation of those next steps.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
PS 156 remains a school that is in Good Standing. According to the most recent Quality Review (2017-2018), the 
school sets and communicates high expectations of all stakeholders and provides supports to achieve those 
expectations. 

During the 2018-2019 school year, the entire PS 156 school community will continue to be priorite the need for 
students to engage in Guided Reading so that more students can end the year reading on or above grade level. As per 
the 2018 NYS ELA exam twenty four percent of students read on grade level.  

We will also continue to prioritize problem solving through use of the S.O.L.V.E. strategy. This will support the school 
community with continuing to increase proficiency in Mathematics. As of August 2018, 21% of students are proficient 
in Mathematics. This number represents a 1% increase from the 2017 NYS Math Exams. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
As of June 2019, all teachers will implement daily Guided Reading lessons with fidelity, thus leading to the strengthening 
of The Big 5-( fluency, phonics, phonemic awareness, vocabulary and comprehension) which will result in an increase in 
reading levels as measured by F& P assessments and proficiency levels on the NYS ELA Exam. A focus will be placed on 
kindergarten through second grade special education teachers by providing them with targeted professional 
development on guided reading, differentiated instruction, small group instruction and Specifically Designed Instruction 
in an effort to increase SWDs reading levels by 2 levels so therefore the students will be reading on the appropriate 
grade level.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
To promote academic gain in reading, we will facilitate 3 cycles of F & P assessments. At least 85% of students will 
move at least 1 level by January, 2019 and at least 2 levels by June 2019. A major goal of the assessment system is to 
estimate students’ reading levels in order to provide appropriate instruction.. 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January 
Regents, etc.) 
We will utilize the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System because it provides valuable information on 
reading accuracy, fluency, and comprehension as well as data to support a broad range of reading, writing, phonics, 
and vocabulary instruction. We will also use the assessment calendar to compare scores and use the data to inform 
instruction. 

 
Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
The principal has established a culture of mutual acceptance and positive attitudes through an abundant of 
opportunities focused on the academic and socio-emotional needs of students. Systems and structures are in place to 
promote safety and inclusiveness for all students which resulted in a nearly 50% reduction in PS 156's School Violence 
Index during the 2017-2018 School Year.  

Nearly half of the staff have been TCIS trained. An area that needs to be strengthened is continuing to provide 
teachers with professional learning and support to effectively de-escalate students that are in crisis and identify 
resources to support them when in crisis. Teachers have engaged in 'Leader in Me Training' to support with the 
implementation of the Seven Habits of Highly Effective People and teacher's are still attending TCIS training on a 
rotational basis. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, all teachers will be 'Leader in Me' trained and will implement the seven habits of highly effective people 
in their daily practice resulting in a 5% decrease in Level 4 and Level 5 infractions and overall school violence index as 
evidenced by the Online Occurrence Reporting System.

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
 According to the 2017-2018 School Survey: 

  98% of teachers say that they use their student's prior knowledge to make their lessons relevant to their 

everyday life. 

  96% of teachers say that they modify instructional activities and materials to meet the development needs. 
  93% of teachers say that they adapt instruction to ensure it includes all backgrounds and cultures positively. 

Based on feedback given during the 2017-2018 Quality Review, there is an identified priority need for teachers to 
work within grade level teams to engage in the collaborative planning process as well as use a structured protocol to 
analyze student work.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, all teachers will have engaged in analyzing assessment data and student work products during Teacher 
Team Meetings using a structured protocol, resulting in a 5 point increase of growth percentiles in both ELA and Math as 
evidenced by NYS English Language Arts, NYS Mathematics Assessments and formative (school-wide) assessments.

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Teachers work in their inquiry teams where they analyze student work and students’ assessments to determine their 
needs. They also work collaboratively in their groups to decide what assessments to give students, then collaborate 
with their colleagues and share their best practices in order to meet their students’ needs. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement.

Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 156, Waverly School of the Arts, in compliance with the Section 1118 of 
Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

[PS 156K Waverly School of the Arts] will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
building literacy in the home workshop, come read with me, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;

The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;

Addendum: Community School Partnerships 

Directions: The Community School (CS) strategy is directly aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. Community 
Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and 
family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in 
Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & 
Wellness. 
 
Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s) 

How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student 
academic outcomes?  
The Community School Partnership has afforded our students to engage in various activities before, during and after 
school (including but not limited to chess, martial arts, steel pan, musical theater, debate, HERstory, culture club, etc.) 
which has led to a reduction in chronic absenteeism and have led to consistent increases in our school's proficiency 
levels and the growth percentiles as evidenced by NYS Assessments. 

 
Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to 
be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   

1.  By June 2019, there will be a 3-5% reduction in chronic absenteeism as evidenced by our ATS reports. 
2.  By June 2019, at least 33% of families will participate in the Community School Forum engaging in activities, 

networking and offering feedback to the school as evidenced by attendance sheets and notes collected. 

3.  By June 2019, there will be 3-5 mental health workshops for parents resulting in an increased awareness of 

services as measured by attendance pages and parent feedback forms. 

 

 

 

Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s): 
How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family 
Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students? 
Achieving our goals in these areas will lead to improve attendance, a reduction in incidents and stronger 
communication between school and family resulting in an increase in positive school environment leading to 
improved student outcomes. 

 

 
Part 2 – Community School Partnerships Core Services Action Plan 

Part 2a. Identify the Community-based Organization (CBO) partnerships that you will develop in ELT, Attendance 
Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & Wellness, their target student population(s), and scope of the services 
provided. As well as supporting schools’ supportive environment and attendance work, CBOs should be helping to 
support your school’s instructional focus.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Early literacy skills are assessed in several ways. We use Fountas & Pinnell Benchmarking, and DIBELS. We also use teacher-
created letter recognition and sight word assessments to track progress. The Spanish LAB and informal assessments are often 
used to determine an ELL’s literacy skills in their native language. Fountas & Pinnell running records provide insights about the 
comprehension and fluency skills our ELLs need to work on. Phonics and reading instruction is guided by the needs discovered 
through these assessments. Running records allow the classroom and ESL Teachers to form guided reading groups by reading 
level, and helps to involve the students in their learning progress. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

 

Team Leaders conduct workshops on how to assess students using the various assessments utilized. Guided reading is 
embedded in the daily schedule. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of the ELL program is evaluated based on data and its analysis.  For example: Has a student demonstrated growth 
in a particular modality or by moving from one level to the next or staying on same proficiency level although in a higher 
grade? This growth will assists us in meeting the AYP for ELLs.  Additionally, the Fall ELL Periodic Assessment is used to identify 
baseline and the Spring ELL Periodic Assessment is used to identify progress. Moreover, the success of the ELL program is 
measured holistically as well:has a student become more independent and willing to speak the English language and 
participate in class; has his class work and assessment performance improved throughout the academic year; is he using CALPS 
as well as BICS when communicating with his peers and teachers;also is there less language interference?   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Some structures we have in place to address interventions once the summative data is gathered and analyzed are integration 
of blended instruction, small settings, push-in and pull-out services, differentiation in lessons, flexibility in grouping, additional 
support services as needed,as well as after school programs and activities. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
To begin with, our school has a clear understanding of their ELLs’ native language and English proficiency, which is evaluated in 
accordance with NYC DOE guidance. Core Tier 1 instruction and Tier 2 and 3 interventions for ELLs are culturally relevant and 
linguistically appropriate, in addition to being research- and evidence-based. Other background variables such as immigration 
patterns and/or disruption in formal education are also considered when evaluating the impact on ELL achievement in an 
English-speaking classroom. Using RTI enables students to receive assistance at their level of need, promptly. 
Data from screening and progress monitoring assists in driving decisions about instruction and intervention, as well as provide 
teachers and parents with valuable and current information regarding a student’s performance.  
A multi-tiered system of support provides flexibility to access interventions as needed. For example, a student can move from 
Tier 1 to Tier 2 and back to Tier 1 within a relatively short period of time as seen with the integration of fluid small grouping.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The broad patterns that are revealed by looking at NYSITELL 2015-2016 data are that our students continue to be more 
proficient in Listening and Speaking than in Reading and Writing, and NYSESLAT 2016-2017 reveals that most of our eligible 
and entitled ELLs are at the Transitioning and Expanding levels of proficiency. This contrasts with the Entering and  Emerging 
scores that our recent entering students tend to receive. This indicates when our students first arrive at PS 156, their 
proficiency in English is rather limited. After 1-2 years of ESL services, their scores tend to rise 1-2 levels. This indicates that our 
ESL program, and the instruction students are receiving in the general education classroom are moving students toward 
English language proficiency.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

ENL Teacher creates own schedule based on the findings of the data as well as groups students according to mandates and 
language proficiency while further grouping them based on their needs and strengths.

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The ESL program is organized as a Pull-Out model. The program model is generally heterogeneous (of mixed 
proficiency levels and contiguous grades allowed by the mandates).  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Paste response to questions here:    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

  Paste response to questions here:    

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           For the most part, the principal tries to organize each grade so that there are three to four ELLs in the same class and 
that a paraprofessional or teacher in that class is able to communicate with the student in the student's native language. This 
enables ESL groups to be arranged more efficiently and provides additional peer support and teacher support within the 
general classroom context.  As per CR Part 154, at times, there are multi-graded groups of two contiguous grades. This ensures 
that Entering and Emerging students are receiving 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week  Transitioning and Expanding 
students receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction per week.  Also, Commanding students will be receiving 90 minutes of ESL 
instruction per week.  These minutes are broken down into mandated stand alone and integrated ENL instruction. 
Furthermore, the classroom teacher provides ELA instruction via the mandated literacy block in addition to the ENL 
mandates.     
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
    The ESL program at P.S. 156 is based on the New York State Core Curriculum for English as a Second Language and the 
Common Core State Standards for reading, writing, and language . Its primary objective is to enable students to achieve 
English language proficiency as quickly as possible. The curriculum is designed to address the academic and linguistic needs of 
all levels of English language learners. All ELLs are afforded educational and instructional opportunities to foster their success. 
The ESL program is designed to intensify instruction in a variety of modalities that include: Total Physical Response, the natural 
language approach, the content based approach, as well as the language experience approach. Literacy and oral language 
instruction are integrated from the earliest language learning experiences. Children are provided simultaneous access to 
English oral language development, comprehensive literacy instruction, and standards-based content area instruction while 
utilizing the SIOP model. 
     Instruction is based on New York State “English as a Second Language” standards. Lessons are always crafted to enable 
students to use English to communicate in social settings, to use English to achieve academically in all content areas in the 
classroom, and to use English in socially and culturally appropriate ways. 
       The ESL teacher supplements both math and reading skills through fiction and nonfiction stories that provide content 
through which mathematical concepts, patterns, problem solving, and real-world contexts may be explored in read alouds, 
think alouds, discussion, and teacher produced projects. This is done in a small-group instruction setting through thematic 
units. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

   Plan instruction based on what is known about the student’s current level of performance and his or her literacy experiences 
in L1 and L2. Evaluate the potential effect of the process of L1 and L2 acquisition on current performance. Assess students’ 
language skills in L1 and L2 to provide an appropriate context regarding evaluation of current levels of performance.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 a. There are currently no SIFE students included in the ESL program. In the case of SIFE students, assessments from Dibels, as 
well as Go Math, and teacher observations, teacher made assessments, and writing samples would provide the ESL and 
classroom teacher with information about the needs of the students. Then a specific instructional plan would be created to 
meet their needs. Also, student needs would be reassessed on a regular basis to see if student goals are being met.  
b. ELLs in the school for less than three years are provided with practice in speaking with a specific focus on basic interpersonal 
communication skills necessary for navigating through the school day with teachers and classmates in a risk-free setting.. 
 Songs, rhymes, and poems are used to aide Entering students. Visual aides are used to give language and vocabulary context. 
Word walls with illustrations and physical manipulatives are also used to reinforce vocabulary development, understanding, 
and usage. Letter and number strips are used to reinforce for newcomers the letter and number formation as well as the 
sounds associated with the letters. In addition, read alouds, think alouds, and discussions with fiction and non fiction big 
books. Also, individual copies of texts are used to reinforce higher order thinking skills and content comprehension. 
Furthermore, the ESL teacher integrates intensive oral/aural language activities to secure listening/speaking skills.  
c. For ELLs receiving between four to six years of service, most typically reading comprehension and writing organization 
difficulties impede progress. Therefore, a variety of additional support is provided. The writing process involving 
brainstorming, drafting, revising, editing, and publishing enables more advanced students to hone their writing skills. Specific 
attention is paid to the student's ability to compose a main idea and support it with key details and a conclusion. At the same 
time, they practice correct grammar, syntax, and standard usage. Visuals and illustrated word walls continue to be utilized to 
support vocabulary development and content understanding. Furthermore, there is an alignment of goals and tasks to 
common core requirements and ESL standards. Graphic organizers are utilized to help students organize and synthesise ideas 
in reading and writing. Pre, post and interim assessments are used to determine needs and judge progress. 
Deeper higher order thinking questions aligned with Bloom's taxonomy are incorporated into discussions and writing and 
reading tasks. 
d. Long term ELLs would receive similar instruction to ELLs receiving between four to six years of service.  ELLs identified as 
students with disabilities are fully integrated with general education students in ESL groups. They receive the 360 or 180 
minutes of services weekly that their proficiency level indicates. 
e.Former ELLs in years 1 and 2, after testing Proficient in NYSESLAT, receive continuing testing accomodations and academic 
support for 2 years. This transitional support includes 90 minutes integrated ENL instruction, as well as Close Workshop, 
Writing Workshop, guided reading, and Saturday Academy for ELA and Math.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
        ELL students with special needs receive instruction based on their IEPs. Special consideration is given to their specific 
needs. 
        The ESL teacher uses different strategies and approaches to assist students in acquiring academic language; using context 
to figure out unfamiliar words and expressions as well as images and realia; one on one instructions, buddy-peer mentoring, 
manipulatives or a behavior plan when necessary. The ESL teacher also uses challenging but understandable materials. The 
teacher encourages students to participate in group discussions, and students gain advantage by receiving feedback from the 
teacher and their peers through modeling.           
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

        Currently, there are five ESL-SWD students being pulled out for ELL services. To help these students achieve their IEP goals 
and attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment, the ESL teacher conducts meetings with their respective 
classroom teachers and support service providers. These students are included in the groups with general education students 
for the duration of the ESL instructional periods.  Furthermore, the ESL teacher uses different strategies that help students to 
acquire academic language, and uses context to figure out unfamiliar words and expressions, as well as  one on one 
instructions, buddy-peer mentoring, manipulatives, or a behavior plan when necessary. The ESL teacher uses challenging but 
understandable materials. The teacher encourages students to participate in group discussions, and students gain advantage 
by receiving feedback from the teacher and their peers through explicit instruction and modeling.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Targeted intervention programs includes Early Elementary Phonics program which services early elementary grade students. 
Also, BCS program is another program where students are tutored or provided homework help as well as enrichment during 
after school. Additionally, during school hours and at home students use the RAZ PLUS KIDS program, which has instructional 
resources for students and allows them to read various genres at their independent reading level while having the option of 
having the book read to them prior to them reading it independently as well as comprehension quizzes and ability to record 
their reading and sending it to their teacher for evaluation and feedback . We will also provide guidance on how to use the 
“RAZ PLUS” program that we have adopted, and introduce parents to other online resources.  ELLs will receive additional 
support through their participation in Saturday Academy, which will be offered from November to May. This will provide 
support in ELA, math, and other content areas for all ELL subgroups. 
Several measures have been taken to ensure the continued success of students who achieve a score of Commanding on the 
NYSESLAT. 
First, the parent is informed that their child is no longer mandated to receive ESL services, but instead will receive two years of 
support ESL services for these critical transitional years.  The student will be seen 90 minutes per week in a group consisting 
only of students who have scored at the Expanding and Commanding levels. Academic Intervention Services (AIS) are also 
offered to transitional ELLs who appear to need additional support to succeed in the monolingual classroom.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

P.S. 156 programs are continually being evaluated as to whether they are meeting the needs of our students. This is measured 
through data obtained from assessments, classwork, teacher observations, portfolios and projects. Should any program be 
deemed as not meeting the needs of the students, or as an improvement for the upcoming year,  a team of teachers evaluate 
various programs and decide what changes should be made.              
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

There will be no discontinued programs for ELLs.    
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Equal access to all school programs is ensured by information being distributed in the home language. After school  and 
Saturday programs for all students including  ELLs are offered  in Dance, Music, Computer, Science, ELA and Math as well as in 
extra-curricular activities such as Karate, Soccer, Photography and Robotics. These programs allow ELLs to expand on their 
BICS while acquiring more CALPS by immersing them in the learning. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
 Since, technology is an important instructional tool in the ESL classroom, the SMARTBoard is utilized in order to provide extra 
visual aides and context for lessons using the internet. A computer center is also incorporated into ESL instructional time, 
where students are given opportunities to listen to books and complete activities related to thematic units. Reading A to Z is 
utilized to expose students to a wide variety of authentic texts at their level. The ESL classroom has a vast library with many 
digital resources, which ensures students are exposed to a wide variety of genres, reading strategies, and vocabulary. Bilingual

dictionaries and glossaries are always available to students, and native language supports are provided by the instructor for 
ELLs in all levels of language proficiency. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language is supported through the use of cognates, a bilingual alphabet chart, and culturally relevant texts in different 
languages. When learning new vocabulary, students are encouraged to also write the word in their notebooks, translated into 
the native language. Students are exposed to texts that incorporate foreign language words into English writing so students 
can connect to English books. Explicit use of the native language during instructional time occurs only when absolutely 
necessary within the framework of the ESL class, and usually with new arrivals to ease them into their new school 
experience.      
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

 Our ELL students receive native language support through teachers and paraprofessionals whose first language is either 
Haitian- Creole or Spanish. These two groups represent the great majority of our ELL population. Our program also provides 
the students with learning opportunities that make clear links between students’ past learning and new concepts. It is done 
through a systematic vocabulary study that capitalizes on cognates and language/academic skill transfer. Another strategy 
used in the ESL classrooms to promote native language support is "peer conference." During this time, the students are 
allowed to check notes and confer with one another in their native languages for understanding of content while learning 
English. Native language materials are also provided in a variety of proficiency levels. Additionally, the ESL teacher is 
encouraged to follow the ELA curriculum and implement the CCSS through ESL strategies when planning their lessons. This 
approach makes it possible for the students to either be introduced or to further their linguistic and academic knowledge in 
English. Through a free-standing program, the students are exposed to data driven and differentiated instruction lessons which 
allow them to advance according to their proficiency level. The classroom is equipped with desktops, a smartboard, laptops 
and a listening center; thus, making it possible for all students to receive instructions according to their needs, language 
proficiency and learning style. The above described services and resources are grade and age appropriate respectively.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
 Since, we are a Community Learning School all of our resources are shared by both schools. Additionally, we collaborate 
with  teachers, administrators and staff to ensure that all of the ELLs needs are met. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
The school leadership, our Parent Coordinator, SLT, PTA members, and ESL teacher invite parents/guardians of ELLs to attend 
workshops that address the educational needs of ELLs, make translators available, disseminate materials and notifications in 
the home languages of the parents/guardians, and provide information about needed support services.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

PS 156 does not offer any language electives at this time.    
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Professional development for teachers at PS 156 occurs through several channels. Regular professional development sessions 
facilitated by coaches include strategies for involving ELLs in the mainstream class, as well as methods of scaffolding to make 
material more accessible. Information distributed at the network level is turnkeyed by our ESL teacher. Our ESL teacher has 
also had the opportunity to attend workshops held throughout the city. This training has also been shared with our staff during 
grade meetings and professional development sessions. This training will satisfy the 7.5 hour requirement under Jose P.

development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
During our Parent Engagement time on Tuesdays, ELL parents will be invited to come in for a one on one meeting to discuss 
their child's goals, developmental progress and language proficiency amongst other topics.  Provisions for interpretation and 
translation will be provided by the Translation Department services over the phone, as well as by staff.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Naiyma Moore Allen, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

In order to assess our school’s written translation and oral interpretation needs, we utilize the Home Language 
Survey to identify language spoken at home. We also keep a record of families that need translation services. 
Additionally, we send out letters translated in Spanish and English. We also provide interpreters at any school 
function for parents who request translation.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Parent surveys will assist us in gathering feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services.
