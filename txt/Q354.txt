Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          6 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

At PS 354 our mission is to provide each student a purposeful education in a safe, supportive environment that 
encourages critical thinking, self-discipline, motivation and excellence in learning. We believe that children learn best 
in an environment that is fully supportive of their social, emotional and academic needs. A great emphasis is placed 
on students making their thinking visible to encourage meaningful discussion and writing across the content areas. 
Our students learn in different ways on different days, so we give our children the opportunity to make meaning of 
their own learning by engaging in hands-on exploration, inquiry through the lens of the Engineering Design Process. 
The PS 354 team is committed to partnering with parents and the community to assist our students in developing the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 

skills that build the foundation for independence, problem solving, self-sufficiency and the drive to be viable 
contributors in our global community.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P.S. 354 The Jermaine L. Green STEM Institute of Queens is located in the heart of South Jamaica. We are a STEM 
based school, serving students from Pre-K through fifth grade and offers a curriculum that brings together Science, 
Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) in ways that make learning fun and engaging for all students. We 
know that every student at P.S. 354 will not choose a career in a STEM related field, but we also understand that in 
order to be successful in these fields or any other profession, there are specific habits of mind with a strong emphasis 
on critical thinking and problem solving that need to be emphasized. 

Our classrooms, labs, and offices are focused on collaborative learning that encourage students to ask questions, 
investigate different approaches to solving problems and explore content so they have a better understanding of 
what they are learning each day. Teachers are required to think beyond the textbooks in order to make the learning 
relevant and meaningful to the students they serve. 

STEM based thinking is a mindset that promotes student efficacy through conceptual thinking, guided exploration and 
discovery over procedural and compliant learning. We have adopted the Engineering Design Process (EDP) as a 
framework for students and staff to reinforce the importance of process based thinking to promote problem solving 
and revisions. As a third year New York City Showcase School, we continue to push ourselves and our curriculum by 
thinking about Internal Coherence to ensure cohesion and alignment between the instructional core and varied 
aspects of our school program. This action based research has also grounded our focus in ensuring equitable 
opportunities and outcomes for all students in our school community.  

This foundation of STEM has allowed us to layer in curricular features that further promote student engagement and 
opportunities to expose our students to college and career options based on this framework of thought. We utilize 
partnerships with organizations to enhance not only the quality of learning and engagement in the classroom but to 
also extend the learning beyond the traditional classroom walls. Some of our partnerships include but are not limited 
to, Marquis Studios, NY Sun Works, Girls Who Code, Algebra for All, Computer Science for All, Engineering is 
Elementary, Playworks, Project Recess, City Parks Foundation's Learning Gardens and the Efficacy Institute out of 
Cambridge to support growth mindset and Yale University to support dialogue around social emotional learning.  

As we continue to develop and progress as a school, the emphasis on critical thinking and maintaining a STEM-centric 
culture will remain at the forefront of our work. We understand that STEM is a mindset that transcends programs and 
gadgets; and our students will continue to demonstrate the power of learning through exploration, inquiry and 
application to get smart. As we transition away from the additional funding that our magnet grant funding afforded 
us, we have focused our attention on further development of our Project Based Learning (PBL) units to ensure that 
there is consistent evidence of writing across the content areas by focusing our inquiry on student work products and 
assessment outcomes. Teachers and administrators collaborate to monitor data on student achievement, impact of 
initiatives, and make timely adjustments to curriculum, instruction and student tasks to ensure continued student 
progress and growth toward mastery of the common core learning standards.  

Though our federal magnet funds expired in the 2017-2018 school year, we have developed collaborative working 
relationships various partners to build teacher capacity and sustain the foundation that we have established over the 
last four years. We have been able to allocate money to support teacher planning and content development that will 
allow us to continue our programming and curriculum use moving forward. Our school business manager in 
conjunction with teachers and administrators, aggressively work to secure other grants that allows us to maintain 
programs. Our partnerships with colleges and universities such as NYIT also ensure that we are able to provide on-
going support and innovation for the staff at no additional cost to us. Technology changes constantly and we will

upgrade and replace our technology as needed based on the needs of the students and the demands of the 
curriculum. The core of our sustainability lies in the shared vision for STEM integration by all stakeholders in our 
school. We have cultivated an environment that conveys STEM is who we are, it’s not just something we do. 

Our instructional focus for 2018-2019 is to delve deeper into supporting students in making their thinking visible 
through the lens of student work. Our vision to increase student agency, critical thinking, and problem solving by 
integrating the Engineering Design Process will be driven by our studies in Internal Coherence though inquiry in 
analyzing stated vs. enacted tasks to understand the consequences and impact of students engaging in varied learning 
experiences.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Principal Performance Observation feedback suggests that a greater emphasis needs to be placed on our growing 
population of ELL students and continuously address the need to build on academic vocabulary. This will be an area of 
focus for SWD's and students in our lowest third of performance as well.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our most recent Quality Review feedback shows that as a school we are well developed in the instructional core. 
Based on our School Quality Guide our data shows that we have made increases across all six elements of the 
Framework for Great Schools by way of staff and parent responses with the most noteworthy increase shown in 
strong family and community ties. Our key area of focus for this year will be supportive environment, which although 
reflects growth, is still lower than the city average.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
According to the most recent school quality guide we used the following data to support our next steps to drive 
continued rigorous instruction in our school: 

  92% of teacher say that students feel challenged.  
  89% of teachers say that students have to work hard to do well. 
  53% of teachers say that students respond to challenging test questions.  
  47% of teachers say that students respond to challenging questions in class.  

We also reviewed the June Instructional report data from 2017 and 2018 to conduct an item analysis of student 
differences in multiple choice questions vs. extended response questions on the same standard on state exams which 
revealed that on the same standard, students under performed themselves on open-ended and constructed response 
questions.  
 
As part of our vision to increase student agency and support students in making their thinking visible, we will be 
focusing on integrating the use of thinking maps and process based learning to drive student response to tasks that 
have big questions, open-ended questions that requires inquiry or problem solving to work through it. Content will be 
relevant to the real worlk, have multi-step solutions and multiple entry points to access the task. Learning will be 
hands on and visual and will require discussion or incorporation of multiple perspectives to see a solution. This will be 
infused through multiple subjects and content areas.  

  

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019 85% of all students in grades K-5 will demonstrate grade level proficiency in responding to open ended and 
constructed response questions in ELA and mathematics as measured by fall and spring performance task assessments 
graded against NYS common core aligned rubrics.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
Family engagement will include family workshops, family fun nights, publishing parties in writing, our Parent 
Exploratorium, which allows parents to visit classrooms of their choosing and see students in action. Teachers create 
monthly grade specific newsletters to parents that detail priority and focus standards with resources, websites and 
strategies to support learning at home. The PS 354 website, ps354.org also has links to online resources. Beginning in 
September 2018 the school will conduct a 12 week roll-out of thinking maps to expose parents and the school 
community to one map and/or the essential features of a thinking map to support the use and language of thinking 
maps beyond the classroom. Project Based Learning (PBL) units culminate in a presentation for students in all grades 
PK - 5 in which parents are invited to see how all subjects contribute to the completion of a task and application of 
standards and skills across the grade. Each unit runs approximately 6-8 weeks depending on the grade and particular 
unit of study. Grade teams, parent coordinator are mainly responsible for implementation. Oversight is supported 
through administration and the budget manager who will ensure proper materials and supplies are available. When

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
The progress monitoring of our curriculum will begin early in the school year and be a major aspect of our normal 
routines. However, we will conduct school wide data days to evaluate our progress and the overall impact of our 
curriculum on student achievement and make effective adjustments to meet all students’ learning needs and 
students are aware of their next learning steps. These data days will be conducted in October, December, February, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 

 

April and June. In February we will have a mid-year school wide performance task assessment to measure our 
progress toward meeting this goal. We will analyze the growth of student proficiency on open ended performance 
tasks in both ELA and Math to monitor impact.  
 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January 
Regents, etc.) 
Unit assessments and quarterly performance tasks will be administered to assess progress.  

 
Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
School culture has always been an area of celebration among school reviews. However, as a school that is now fully 
realized as a PK – grade 5 school, we are pushing ourselves to foster an environment that provides increased 
opportunity for student voice and youth development for all students within their varied stages of development.  

 

Through the lens of the School Quality Guide teacher views on student behavior has been noted as an area of 
improvement.  

  53% of teachers say that students listen carefully when the teacher gives directions 
  58% of teachers say that students follow the rules in class.  

Peer collaboration and the quality of professional development was rated on par with the city average with over 85% 
of teachers demonstrating satisfaction.  

  60% of teachers say that they had opportunities to work productively with teachers from other schools on 

professional development.  

 

Our preliminary quality review feedback reveals that although it is clear that all students are known to at least 3 
adults in the building by name, there isn't a tangible structure in place to ensure this happens with fidelity. For the 
2017-2018 school year going into the current 2018-2019 school year, we have the highest number of students moving 
into least restrictive environments, culminating in a 50% reduction of self-contained classes in the school. To support 
these transitions and the continued need for a common language around social-emotional discourse, our staff will 
implement the ruler study for emotional learning through Yale University.  

 

To ground the shift in behavior supports into student work outcomes, students will have increased time for debates, 
collaborations, planning through the Engineering Design Process through STEM challenges to support self-assessing, 
revising and improvement of products to show their thinking through questions posed by themselves and their peers. 
Students will demonstrate for their parents and teachers their persistence and areas of growth and continued focus 
by student driven conferences that are grounded in actionable feedback provided by their teachers.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16 

 

To increase the number of teachers who believe they've had opportunities to work with teachers from other school's 
on professional development, intra-district school visitations will be organized to support teachers learning in student 
lead conferences with schools that currently have experience in that practice.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019 all students in grades K-5 will participate in at least 2 student lead conferences that reflect student areas 
of strength and areas of continued focus by way of at least 3 student work products that have evidence of teacher 
feedback that is aligned to a standards based rubric with feedback that includes glows, grows and actionable next 
steps with opportunities for improvement to be shared with parents.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
We will use the data over the last 3 years to ensure a continued downward trend in number of student suspensions 
as noted in OORS. Student work portfolios will also highlight evidence of student publications and work samples from 
PBL units over the span of the year. Student lead conferences will take place during January and mid spring parent 
teacher conferences.  
 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Preliminary Quality Review feedback noted that teachers teams were a special area of focus as the school fell short of 
a well developed because their was no evidence of sub-groups of students being tracked for mastery of grade level 
standards.  

We have a strong foundation to build on based on the NYC school Quality Guide data for 2018: 

  100% of teachers say that they talk with each other about instruction 

  82% of teachers say that at their school, the principal, teachers and staff collaborate to make the school run 

effectively.  

  91% of teachers say that at their school teachers make a conscious effort to coordinate their teaching with 

instruction at other grade levels 

  97% of teachers say that they design instructional programs (lessons, units) together.  

We will leverage the findings of the 2018 June Instructional report to identify our priority standards in ELA and 
mathematics to encourage vertical alignment across grades on the focus areas and use student proficiency data 
identify sub-groups of students that will be reflective of the entire spectrum of learners in our school community to 
monitor and track to mastery of grade level standards.  
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019 all teachers in grades K-5 will implement common assessments and complete at least 3 cycles of inquiry 
with a specific focus on student work products in identified sub-groups of students to support timely refinements in 
curriculum and instruction resulting in a 25% increase of students demonstrating mastery in the identified priority 
standards.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 
development, and/or systems and structures needed 
to impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-
credited, SIFE, STH). 

 

Curriculum planning and on-going professional development to 
support teacher understanding of the Common Core Learning 
Standards. Teachers in grades K-5 in consultation with a coach 
from Metamorphosis worked to revise grade level curriculum 
maps and highlight priority standards based on June 2018 
instructional reports. These maps reflect the instructional 
shifts, mathematical practices, foundational lessons to support 
the habits of mind and perseverance in problem solving in math 
(also aligned to the EDP) and rigorous tasks with success 
criteria that builds in complexity across grade levels. Revision of 
these maps will be on-going based on the outcomes of teacher 
inquiry cycles.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The NYC School Quality Guide reflects a continued increase on perceptions about trust and effectiveness of school 
leadership. With an average 93% positive rating for inclusive leadership, the principal and assistant principals will 
leverage that highlight to continue to support the 73% of teachers who suggest that there is still work to be done 
around supports for teachers in regards to social-emotional learning opportunities and behavioral escalations in the 
classroom.  

As a New York City Showcase School for the third year in a row, it is evident that the focus on the instructional core to 
leverage STEM as a proponent to elevate student engagement has had a positive impact by way of student 
achievement and a reduction of over 25% in behavioral occurences in our Online Occurence Reporting System 
(OORS). However, our continued action research and analysis of student outcomes reveal the opportunity to go 
deeper in culturally responsive teaching to support social emotional growth and solving disproportionality and 
achieving equity among all students.  

The work of leadership will focus on our continued goal of reducing the number of students being referred for special 
education services and suspension/behvior referalls through exploration of bias based beliefs and building an equity 
belief school culture. In addition to the Danielson Framework for teaching, feedback for observations,class 
intervisitations and walkthroughs will also highlight the Teaching for Robust Understanding (TRU) Observation Guide. 
It focuses on the Five Dimensions of powerful classrooms:

Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019 100% of teachers complete at least one professional learning cycle on biased based thinking to highlight 
areas of growth in teaching to support equity and access for all students. This will be measured in lesson feedback that 
is given to teachers that will focus on at least 3 of the five dimensions of powerful classrooms with actionable next steps 
to ensure alignment between enacted tasks and the school vision.

As a new and consistently growing school we are constantly striving to increase our opportunities to create and 
strengthen collaborative relationships with our families. We continue to focus on establishing a culture for learning 
that communicates high expectations to staff, students, and families, and provide supports to achieve those 
expectations As we grow, we are also looking to build new relationships with our community. We have been striving 
to create opportunities that allow and support the voices of our parents who are unable to come to the building. Our 
school currently utilizes Pupil Path (a school wide system that provides parents with immediate feedback about their 
child’s academic, social and behavioral progress), our school website, teacher emails, Twitter and Instagram to create 
an open line of communications between the school and home. Our guidance counselor and parent coordinator co-
facilitate workshops and CookShop sessions for parents. Our parent coordinator and magnet specialists also co-
facilitate monthly Parent Exploratorium’s that give parents an opportunity to tour the school, visit classrooms, and 
volunteer. We also created partnerships this year with Learning Leaders, our CBO- Sheltering Arms and institutions 
such as NYIT, New York Cares, Marquis Studios, and City Parks Learning Gardens. These partnerships have helped us 
to increase our parent involvement in schools and our impact on the community.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Skedula is an online program that allows teachers to input 
student grades and anecdotal records. Parents are able to get 
immediate access to student grades, class events, and school 
activities. Teachers and parents are also able to communicate 
through a message system. Parents can easily access this 
program through their smart phone, laptop or tablet. They can 
receive alerts through their email and text when the classroom 
teacher has updated information about their child. 

Monthly workshops are provided for parents about instruction 
and strategies for helping their child. Special workshops for 
subgroups (SWD and ELLs) conducted to educate parents on the 
special needs of their learners. CookShop workshops are 
provided for parents once a month to support healthy and less 
costly eating habits. Parents are invited into the building to cook 
new recipes and eat the results. Children are exposed to the 
program through science class resulting in communication 
between parents and their children about what they learned. 

Our Parent Exploratorium invites parents to come to the building 
once a month, tour classrooms on specific grades and ask 
questions and learn about our building and the learning. Parents 
are invited to volunteer in classrooms and participate in STEM 
events throughout the year. 

There will be an ongoing menu of parent workshop options to 
support parents in understanding the fundamentals of the 
variety of programs and academic initiatives we have fostered or 
will implement in the 2017-2018 school year. These foundational 
workshops will include but are not limited to:  

-Making Thinking Visible Through Thinking Maps 

-Efficacy: Work Hard, Get Smart 

-STEM - Understanding the Engineering Design Process 

-Today a Reader, Tomorrow a Leader: The 100 Book Challenge 

-Algebra 4 All - College and Career readiness in Math

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

above mentioned 
goals. 
 

 
1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement.

Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 354, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary 
and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS 354 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 
● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 
decision making in support of the education of their children; 
● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 
● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on 
the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase 
and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 
● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the 
school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies 
as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical 
support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  
● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of 
the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming 
and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for 
parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support 
services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  
● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 
● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents 
of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be 
involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other 
applicable sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act; 
● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the 
Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  
● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Each ELL, along with the rest of the student body, is assessed at the beginning of each year using the Teachers College Running 
Record Assessment.  These running records are conducted periodically, beginning in September, in order to determine each 
student’s literacy strengths and weaknesses.  The information gained during the running records assessment is used to make 
any adjustments to the ENL program schedule in order to best meet the needs of the students.  It is also then used to 
differentiate instruction further.  Reading groups and tasks are created based on this data.  According to the results of the 
running records assessment, all first grade ELLs are reading one level below grade level. Fifty percent of second grade ELLs are 
reading on grade level.  In third grade, 37.5% of ELLs are reading on or above grade level.  All fourth grade ELLs are reading 
below grade level, and 50% of fifth grade ELLs are reading above grade level.  The data also shows that entering and emerging 
students struggle with vocabulary and articulating their responses while expanding students struggle with making inferences. 
With this information, the Superkids Reading program was chosen by the administration to assist students with the early 
literacy skills of phonics, phonemic awareness, vocabulary, fluency, and comprehension.   The Reading Street literacy program

was chosen to support instruction for students in grades two through five in order for students to strengthen their inferential 
skills.  Both programs are used as resources to support the achievement of the Common Core Learning Standards.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Success of ELLs is evaluated through a variety of ways such as examining the progress made in the running records 
assessments, NYSESLAT scores, and improvement through informal and formal assessments conducted by the ENL and 
classroom teacher.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
ELLs are given additional instruction in their areas of need within the Response to Intervention framework by providing them 
with small group instruction, both in and out of the classroom.  During the school year, additional classes are provided through 
the After School Academic Intervention Program and the Saturday School Program.  Different instructional programs are used 
during these times in order to cater to the different ways students learn.  The support services are aligned to the intervention 
plans the school is already providing to the students.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
After examining the NYSESLAT scores, the results show that across all proficiency levels, students struggle most with reading 
and writing.  Students who range from the entering to transitioning proficiency levels struggled with listening as well.  Across 
grades, it is clear that the students who have been enrolled in the school, and in turn the ENL program, reached a higher 
proficiency level than those in younger grades or those who are newer to the school.  The RLAT  is used to analyze the results 
of the NYSESLAT.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The freestanding English as a new language program consists of both a push-in program and a pull-out 
program.  Most groups that are pulled out are grouped by grade and consist of mixed proficiency levels.  These groups 
are provided with both stand-alone ENL instruction and integrated ENL instruction through content area 
instruction.  One pulled group consists of similar proficiency levels, regardless of grade.  This group is provided 
additional stand-alone ENL instruction.  The push-in program is designed by grade, regardless of proficiency

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

                              The administration and ENL teacher work to design a schedule to ensure that all students are being serviced 
for their mandated number of instructional minutes.  Students at the transitioning and expanding proficiency levels are pulled 
for 180 minutes throughout the week for integrated ENL instruction.  Commanding students are pulled for 90 minutes of 
integrated ENL instruction.  Students at the entering and emerging proficiency levels are pulled for 270 minutes of both stand-
alone ENL and integrated ENL instruction.  These students also receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL instruction via a push-in 
model.     
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
                The ENL program is scheduled to align with English language arts instruction, as well as science and social studies 
instruction.  The following strategies are used for helping ELLs with content area learning.  All activities are done entirely in 
English since a freestanding ENL program is the only program currently used at PS 354. 
-               Fronting vocabulary accompanied by pictures before a unit or book  
-               Writing key words or phrases on the board 
-                Pre-listening activity that explains the purpose for the listening activity 
-               Drawing on students’ background knowledge of the topic 
-               Going on a picture walk through a book 
-               Pointing to various objects and characters throughout picture books 
-               The use of repetitions and chants 
-               Acting out scenes from a book connecting to the content area 
-               Using native language supports 
-               Enhancing a lesson with realia and technology 
        All of these instructional strategies are done using a grade appropriate text.  Materials used are the same materials used 
by the rest of the students, regardless of whether or not they are ELLs.  No materials are simplified.  Guided reading, however, 
is done on the students’ instructional reading level. Discussion prompts are used to encourage students to question, answer, 
and build discussion in English.  All lessons are designed to help students meet the Common Core Learning Standards and the 
NYS ESL Standards.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

                All assessments are done in English.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Differentiated instruction is done for each ELL subgroup.   
•                SIFE students that enter the school will be assessed with the NYSITELL, so long as the student is a new registrant to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

New York state schools, and will continue through the SIFE identification process.  These students will be placed in a group of 
their specific proficiency level.  The academic instruction plan for SIFE students includes teaching English language skills 
utilizing easy to read literature, which contains an array of illustrations, which are appropriate for their particular age 
group.  Picture dictionaries, along with books written in their native language, will provide additional support as well.  In 
addition, SIFE students will be placed in an environment which utilizes alternative assessments, such as using illustrations to 
depict picture to word associations. 
•               For newcomers and for developing students, instruction will be differentiated based on the needs of the 
students.  Data from assessments will be used to determine how the program should be organized, how flexible grouping will 
be determined for small groups, and what kind of instruction is necessary.  All students will receive instruction in the four 
modalities of English and strategies in instruction and discussion will allow them to be college and career ready. 
•               PS 354 is a kindergarten through fifth grade elementary school and therefore has no long term ELLs that have 
completed seven years in an ENL program. 
-       Former ELLs will be provided with 90 minutes per week of integrated ENL instruction for two years.  They will also be 
provided with additional supports to allow them to succeed without the assistance of a full ENL program.  Former ELLs will be 
provided with supportive materials such as vocabulary cards and checklists and placed in small group instruction.  Assessments 
will be used to continue to monitor their progress in reading, writing, speaking, and listening.  These students also receive 
testing modifications, including extended time.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ELLs who have been identified as having special needs will follow in the same way, taking into consideration whether they are 
a newcomer or have been in the program. The ENL teacher and Special Education teacher will collaborate to determine which 
strategies would be most beneficial in order to target the student’s needs based on his/her IEP.  Supportive materials such as 
magnetic boards and white boards, personalized word walls, checklists, and discussion prompts will be provided based on the 
students’ needs.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Scheduling is done to allow ELL-SWDs to work in the least restrictive environment.  Small group instruction allows the ENL 
teacher to focus on the needs of each student in order for IEP goals to be met.  The curriculum used by the ENL teacher is the 
same used by the classroom teacher but with modifications in place.  ELL-SWDs also work in a whole class setting with the 
teacher incorporating special strategies so that lessons are designed to target all students.  The ENL teacher also pushes in to 
assist ELL-SWDs that are in a self-contained setting.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
All classes offered are conducted in English.  Cooperative learning within the reading and writing programs are designed to 
help children in all grades transition from their native language to English.  The ENL teacher also facilitates learning by 
providing specific, amplified instructional strategies to aid in the students’ language growth.  There are scaffolding techniques 
that are used for academic instruction, including templates.  Within each content area, ENL strategies are 
implemented.  Vocabulary fronting, Walqui’s Six Scaffolds, instructional conversations, and word walls help support subjects 
such as social studies and science.  A close examination of fictional and non-fictional texts, as well as poetry, is done in social 
studies and science in order to teach content through literature.  Vocabulary and sentence structure is taught through the 
content as well in order to accommodate both ELLs and native speakers of English. Materials in the native language provide 
additional support in regards to content vocabulary as well as the subject matter itself.  Math lessons include hands-on 
activities with manipulatives, as well as math related texts to connect the content with literacy.  Early phonics readers, big 
book readers, sight word readers, vocabulary cards, graphic organizers, and computer language learning activities are used to 
support ELLs.  Photo tiles are also a teaching tool that can enhance beginning language learning activities.  Intervention 
strategies are used for newcomers, developing students, and former ELLs.  Strategies apply to the needs of the students.    
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

To enhance instruction, Promethean Boards and Smart Boards have been installed in every classroom.  The use of technology 
will improve instruction for all students, including ELLs.  Each classroom will also be equipped with iPads, and students will 
have access to online programs such as myOn and i-Ready.  Students will also be engaged in a project based learning 
approach.  Students will work through lessons by using the engineering design process.  New programs, such as Reading Street, 
will be available with new resources to support lessons.    
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

No programs for ELLs will be discontinued.  However, programs used for ELA have changed.  Programs such as the Wonders 
Reading program will be used solely as a resource in order to support lessons.    
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Additional services are provided during and after school.  Once in session, the after school program is available to all 
students.  The purpose of this supplemental program is to advance the proficiency of all ELLs through content based literacy 
instruction. The program will be an extension of what the ENL and classroom teacher work on during the day.  Students will 
receive additional support in reading and writing.  All support services and resources correspond to ELLs ages and grade levels. 
ELLs are also included in Response to Intervention (RTI) groups throughout the school day.  ELLs are invited to participate in all 
school activities such as the arts, sports, and community based activities.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
An array of instructional materials are used to support the language development of ELLs.  To enhance language instruction, 
students have access to personal word walls, checklists, discussion prompts, magnetic workbooks, decodable readers, 
differentiated readers, letter cards, games, and picture dictionaries.  To enhance instruction in literacy as well as the content 
areas, students also have access to classroom computers, manipulatives, picture cards, and graphic organizers.  Each classroom 
is also equipped with a Promethean Board or Smart Board, iPads, and document camera.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

While the freestanding ENL program is conducted entirely in English, students are giving native language supports such as 
picture dictionaries, native language books, and unit vocabulary in both English and their native language. Translators within 
the building are also able to provide students with directions for classwork and homework in their native language.  Students 
are also given the opportunity to use their native language with others when giving instructions and discussing vocabulary.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

ELLs are provided instruction which aligns with their appropriate grade’s curriculum.  All instructional materials and resources 
support their learning in order for them to meet the same standards as all other students of the same age.  Instruction is 
differentiated within each group in order to meet the needs and proficiency levels of the students.  Lesson are also designed to 
target the learning standards that each student is working towards.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
An array of instructional materials are used to support the language development of ELLs.  To enhance language instruction, 
students have access to personal word walls, checklists, discussion prompts, magnetic workbooks, decodable readers, 
differentiated readers, letter cards, games, and picture dictionaries.  To enhance instruction in literacy as well as the content 
areas, students also have access to classroom computers, manipulatives, picture cards, and graphic organizers.  Each classroom 
is also equipped with a Promethean Board or Smart Board, iPads, and document camera.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

 

Before the school year begins, parents/guardians of newly enrolled ELL students receive an informational packet in their 
preferred language which provides them with information about the school, as well as the various programs they are entitled 
to.  Once the school year begins, parents/guardians of ELLs are invited to an orientation with the ENL teacher.  As students 
enroll throughout the school year, they receive the same informational packet.  Workshops are provided within the school 
monthly as well to all parents, including parents of ELLs, to help them better understand curriculum and the work being done 
in and out of the classroom.    
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

PS 354 is an elementary school where students receive instruction in specialty areas such as art, STEM, and physical 
education.  Language electives are not offered.     
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A   
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
There are periodic professional development sessions, hosted by the Department of Education, at which the ENL teacher 
attends, along with the data specialist and any other necessary staff members such as the special education teacher or subject 
area teachers for literacy and math.  These professional development workshops discuss several instructional strategies to be 
used within the ENL classroom and provide the guidelines so that the school remains in compliance with ENL regulations.  After 
attending these workshops, the attendees then turnkey the information at professional development sessions within the 
school.  During scheduled professional development sessions within the school, common branch teachers, specialty area 
teachers, paraprofessionals, guidance counselors, and speech therapists meet to learn and discuss the information presented 
at the DOE workshops.  At these times, staff members are also trained to read reports regarding a child’s NYSESLAT in order to 
differentiate instruction, gearing it towards their needs.  There are also ongoing weekly meetings with the ENL teacher and 
classroom teachers to ensure curriculum alignment.     
Professional development is also offered to the ENL teacher in supporting ELLs as they engage in the Common Core Learning 
Standards.  These professional development workshops are offered through the DOE, as well as within the building during 
weekly professional learning time.     
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
PS 354 is a kindergarten through fifth grade school.  The classroom teacher, ENL teacher, Special Education teacher, and 
guidance counselor all work together to ensure that all students, including ELLs, are transitioning comfortably into the school 
routine and between grades.  Once students reach fifth grade, professional development is provided to the staff to ensure a 
smooth transition for all students into middle school.  The teachers work with the parent coordinator, the guidance counselor, 
and the families in order to assist ELLs as they transition from one level to another.  The expectation of all students in regard to 
higher education is always stressed.   
All teachers receive ELL-specific professional development during the scheduled professional learning time.  Teachers also

receive professional development by meeting with the ENL teacher.  The ENL teacher receives ELL-specific professional 
development from webinars and workshops held by the DOE.  All professional development is tracked through attendance 
records and agendas.   
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The parent coordinator and ENL teacher are involved with the parents of ELLs by providing support in order for parents to help 
their child with the school’s curriculum.  In addition, the parent coordinator and ENL teacher are readily available to meet with 
parents on an individual basis.  Parental involvement and input is an integral facet of maintaining a positive home-school 
relationship.  Parent choices are reviewed on a periodic, ongoing basis, in order to provide them with options regarding their 
child’s education and to ensure that their choices are respected.  Throughout the year, the ENL teacher maintains a teacher-
parent relationship, keeping the parent/guardian abreast of what is occurring in school via phone call, email, or letter in the 
parent’s preferred language.  PS 354 allows for the involvement of all parents, including those of ELLs.  This is done through 
parent workshops and monthly parent newsletters.  These allow parents to learn strategies pertaining to the curriculum and 
allow them to voice their ideas, concerns, and questions.    

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parents/guardians of ELLs are encouraged to participate in school leadership teams, school activities, join the PTA, serve as 
learning leaders in the school, and attend parent/teacher conferences.  Monthly parent workshops are offered to guide 
parents through the curriculum, and monthly newsletters are sent home to inform parents of upcoming events, school-wide 
programs, and the happenings of what is going on in the building on a daily basis.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Raevan Askew, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
