Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
During 2017-2018 we served 110 students in grades PK and Kindergarten. P.S.376Q will be in our second school year 
during 2018-2019. P.S.376Q will continue to provide a supportive environment with its foundation and school culture 
based on the principles found in the Leader in Me paradigm by Stephen Covey's Seven Habits of Highly Effective 
People. "Leader in Me" aims to shift mindsets with five core paradigms: everyone can be a leader, everyone has 
genius, change starts with me, educators empower students to lead their own thinking, and develop the whole 
person" as CASEL puts it in their own terms. This whole school transformation program provides teachers with a 
variety of practices that support in leadership, culture, and academics. Our school focuses on promoting students to 
embrace full responsibility and actions toward their academic and social emotional learning through the Leader in Me 
7 Habits. This paradigm is supported by the Leader in Me training and interdisciplinary curriculum.  

During our current second year, we will be implementing our second phase of the Leader in Me curriculum by 
“Aligning Academics,” which teaches goal setting and tracking through The 4 Disciplines of Execution, as well as 
introducing Leadership portfolios and Student-led Conferences. Our CARE Team will continue to plan, facilitate, and 
support our Leader in Me paradigm in order to have contiguous coherence across all grades. In addition to Leader in 
Me, which has been recognized by CASEL as a CASEL Select program in March 2018. In efforts to support all 
stakeholders with self-awareness and self-management skills, we are introducing Yale's RULER strategies. This 
additional social-emotional work allows our students to learn how to regulate their feelings and to resort to 
strategies, which will work for them.  

As a growing school, expanding one grade at a time, we hire new teachers every school year with our hiring 
committee. This consists of teachers and the principal. In order for these new teachers to acclimate to our positive 
school culture, we provide opportunities for our newly hired teachers to attend New Teacher Induction professional 
development during the summer. Our staff was involved starting in June to prepare for this teacher training. The two-
day professional learning was facilitated by our teachers who planned with the administration during the summer. 
This learning opportunity for our newly hired teachers in combination with the Leader in Me training that they 
attended allows them to truly understand our school's mission and vision. 

We have strategic collaborations and partnerships with other schools in the district, such P.S./I.S. 178Q and P.S.159Q 
which allow our teachers to visit other classrooms to share best practices and planning resources. These collaborative 
rounds allows our teachers/staff to align our best practices to the new Next Generation Learning Standards, in 
particularly focusing on the early childhood grades, which our school is mainly serving. Another collaboration we have 
within our school district is our district leadership feeder pattern in which we engage in a year-long instructional focus 
and conduct collaborative rounds three times at different schools. We also have forged a partnership with Teacher's 
College Reading and Writing Workshop (TCWRP) for the first time and are looking forward to increase our expertise in 
literacy instruction, which promotes our students to take ownership of their learning. We also have additional literacy

support by having an on-site NYCDOE's Universal Literacy coach who is collaboratively working with our staff and our 
on-site TC staff developer throughout the year to provide differentiated professional learning support based on a 
needs assessment filled out by the teachers in the beginning of the school year.  

We have also been chosen to be part of the Queens North Computer Science Cohort II. A team of teachers is 
spearheading this initiative in collaboration with the Queens North Computer Science Cohort, which includes nine 
other schools. Additional professional learning opportunities are also available for our CS4ALL to meet with the city-
wide computer science cohort. This initiative promotes students to learn to collaborate with others, develop problem-
solving skills, and persist through difficult tasks for the 21st century. Our neighboring Pre-K to 5 PS 31Q school, a 
2018-2019 SEP (computer science) showcase school, partnered up with us last year to promote computer science by 
sending over their Code ambassadors and teaching all of our Pre-K and kindergarten students how to program the 
mouse robots. We are planning to have PS 31 work with us again to teach our Pre-K to Grade 1 students computer 
science. Parent engagement events is also embedded throughout the year starting with the CS4ALL week this 
December. 

These collaborations and initiatives are all aligned to our school’s belief system. Our core beliefs and actions are based 
on the C.A.R.E values which stands for compassion, aspire to lead, relationships matter, and Excellence in Academics. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our population consists of 3.6% Special Ed. students and 11.71% ENL students. Our diverse student population 
includes 20.47% Hispanic, 59.06% Asian, 4.86% Black, 12.87% White, 0.58% American Indian or Alaskan Native and 
2.34% Multi-racial.  

Currently, we have three Pre-K classes that are part of our school-wide initiatives, such as the Leader in Me paradigm, 
RULER strategies, and Breakfast in the Classroom program by providing a supportive and caring environment as the 
basis for learning and growing. We have three Kindergarten classes, one of which is an ICT Classroom. On the first 
grade level, we have two classes, one of which is an ICT class. All of our ELLs are integrated in heterogeneous gen-ed 
classes. This collaborative teaching environment fosters the supportive environment both academically and socio-
emotionally, which are essential factors for meeting academic excellence on the Kindergarten and 1st grade levels.  

Our ENL student population's needs include English language acquisition and comprehension. Being that our school is 
currently serving ENL students who are in the early childhood grades,which include Kindergarten and 1st grade, we 
will be focusing on all four modalities such as listening, speaking, reading and writing skills to build the foundation for 
success in literacy development for students on the Kindergarten grade level. These skills will include recognizing 
letters, sounds, sight words, creating sentences independently and writing through phonemic awareness. In the first 
grade, we will particularly focus on increasing proficiency skills in expression through the modalities of speaking and 
writing, based on the 2017-2018 NYSESLAT data. Based on our early childhood population, our students with 
disabilities' needs include development in all four modalities and social-emotional needs. We will continue to provide 
differentiated lessons based on the Teachers' College Reading and Writing Program and promote skills in these areas 
of need. 

We are providing a supportive environment for the ENL students to meet the rigorous expectations of the Next 
Generation Learning Standards. The ENL students are being supported by a full-time ENL teacher who provides 
services to all ENL students through mostly push in services via collaboration and planning with the classroom 
teachers by implementing small group instruction, scaffolding tasks, frequent clarifications on tasks, and extended 
time as needed on tasks. 

The goal we have set for our special education students created by our School Implementation Team (SIT) is: By the 
end of June of 2019, students will engage in 3 conversational turns related to the topic or question during group and 
pair discussions independently in 4 out of 5 trials quarterly. This is aligned to our school's instructional focus, which is 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

for our students to have as many opportunities throughout the day to participate in group discussions, which in turn 
helps them become independent thinkers.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

We are a newly established school since September 2017. Our school has made a substantial amount of progress in 
the areas of Supportive Environment (4.80 out of 5) and Collaborative Teachers (4.87 out of 5) as evidenced by our 
NYC survey results. This definitely attributes to the trust they built with each other as well as the with the 
administration and the parents (4.94 out of 5). The data indicates that teachers are collaborative and provide a 
supportive learning environment. Our supportive environment is based on our belief system and its values, C.A.R.E., 
which stand for compassion, aspire to lead, relationships matter, and Excellence in Academics. Based on these values, 
the school will focus on promoting students to embrace full responsibility and ownership toward their academic and 
social emotional improvement using the Leader in Me leadership principles and its resources. This program facilitated 
by the Sean Covey Institute promotes students to be compassionate and responsible citizens at school and beyond by 
leading their lives and learning. The Ruler program will also be implemented to provide socio-emotional support for 
students to self-assess and take ownership of their social emotional development. We are also fostering teacher 
leadership by implementing distributive leadership which is promoted by the administration and the Leader in Me 
paradigm. There are multiple committees that teachers lead and facilitate. There are also grade leaders on each grade 
level who facilitate regularly scheduled meetings to collaborate and plan for rigorous instruction aligned to the 
Common Core State Standards.  

For this school year, It is also our goal to provide rigorous instruction as we are implementing diverse curricula 
streamlining it into a multi-disciplinary unit. Our instructional focus for this school "Our students synergize to be 
critical thinkers," emphasizes the importance of discussion in collaboration with peers based around high leveled 
questions. We also focus on how our students can create their own questions related to the subject matter in order 
for to promote further critical thinking skills.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Our school's strength in this area is that our teachers are empowered to create rigorous instruction by collaborating 
with their colleagues and continuously refining their craft to ensure that our students are exposed to achieving 
academic excellence. According to the 2017-2018 school year Advance data, Questioning and Discussion (3b) was our 
lowest rated aspect of teacher practice (2.95). Our teacher survey also revealed that that the discussion of students 
can improve to create more sophisticated discourse as evidenced by the NYC survey where the quality of student 
Discussion was a score of 3.11. The math and science teacher observations, particularly, referred to increased 
opportunities for students to be immersed in inquiry work or centers for collaboration and discussions to thrive. In 
order to meet this goal, we, the staff, explored how we can create a more student-centered classroom to increase the 
collaboration and discussion amongst peers. We concluded that creating a multidisciplinary unit incorporating 
project-based learning would help us meet this goal. This also includes implementing the new Math TERC's 
Investigations curriculum and the new Science Amplify curriculum, both curricula that allow for students to research 
and question more frequently with their peers.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, students will engage in student-centered multidisciplinary instruction as evidenced by three completed 
STEAM project-based learning units.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Our 2017-2018 CEP goal in this framework pillar stated:  

By June 2018, we will create a safe and supportive environment by implementing Stephen Covey’s Leader in Me 
leadership paradigm with all stakeholders and incorporating them into our school’s curricula as measured by a 90% 
satisfaction rating in the 2018 parent survey based on the following two questions: 

1.  At their school, their child feels safe. 
2.  Teachers and parents/guardians think of each other as partner in educating children.  

Based on the 2018 Parent Survey results, we met this goal by showing 99% of families answered "that at 
their school their child is safe" and 98% of families answered "that teachers and families think of each other 
as partners in educating children." 

We would like to continue with implementing phase 2 of the Leader in Me paradigm. This includes an additional 
instructional framework, which requires us to implement the "WIG" (wildly important goal) goal setting for our 
students. In addition, we will provide our students with a supportive and caring environment by rolling out the 
RULER strategies, so that students can take further ownership of their social-emotional well being at school and 
beyond. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, we will create a safe and supportive environment by implementing year 2 of Stephen Covey’s Leader in 
Me leadership paradigm and Yale’s RULER strategies as evidenced by an increase of 2% in the NYC Teacher's survey's 
question that states "teachers say that teacher help maintain discipline in the entire school, not just their classroom."

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Based on the NYC School survey, all questions under the Effective School Leadership category met with 100% 
agreement by teachers. This includes that teachers concur that the principal encourages teacher feedback through 
regular meetings. Through these regular feedback sessions, teachers indicated while the implementation of the 
Teacher's College Reading and Writing workshop was overall successful, they would like to delve deeper into honing 
their craft within specific components of the workshops, such as guided reading. This led to our partnership with TC to 
receive support in improving student academic achievement. This will also support us with our teacher's pedagogy as 
much of TC's workshop model thrives on student partnerships and discussion, so that our 2017-2018 Advance data in 
3b (Questioning and Discussion) can be improved from a combined score of 2.95.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, our school will successfully implement the Teacher’s College Reading and Writing Project curriculum as 
evidenced by a 5% improvement in Danielson's Questioning and Discussion competency.

strategies  to  promote  parent  leadership  and  engagement  in  order  to  support  their  children  at  home?  Include  the 
timeline and identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
Parents will be invited to workshops led by their children's teachers focusing on the Common Core curriculum and 
Rigorous Instruction and will include tips on how to support and enrich their children academically at home. 
Workshops will be held at various times to ensure that they are convenient to all. Parents receive a monthly 
curriculum newsletter to keep them updated on what their children are learning in school, and to provide suggestions 
for resources and activities to do at home. Parent Workshop topics will include developing literacy skills (includes 
Fundations and TC workshops). This will also be combined with the opportunity for them to visit classroom during 
some of these instructional periods, such as reading workshop and writing publishing celebrations.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The following was our last year's CEP goal: June 2018, we will create a strong family-community engagement plan 
with all stakeholders based on Karen Mapp’s and Joyce Epstein’s framework as measured by 90% satisfactory rating in 
the NYC Parent School Survey Report based on the following two questions: 

1. 

Since the beginning of the school year, they have communicated with their child’s teacher about their 
child’s performance sometimes or often. Survey shows 99% of families say that at their school their child is 
safe. Survey shows 98% of families say that teachers and families think of each other as partners in 
educating children 

The lowest scoring question on the parent was "Since the beginning of the school year, they have been asked or 
had the opportunity to volunteer time to support their school" which had an 89% satisfaction rate. The SLT 
determined this to be an area of growth and prioritized additional parent engagement and volunteer opportunities 
for this school year.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, we will establish the HEART (Health and Wellness, Equity, Acceptance, Respect team) committee, 
which promotes the healthy whole-child development and habits in order to increase student attendance and 
punctuality as measured by a 2% increase in the overall student attendance.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 376Q, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

P.S. 376 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

  providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, 

e.g., literacy, math and use of technology; 

  providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

 

decision making in support of the education of their children; 
fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 

  providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
 

sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and 
in languages that parents can understand; 

  providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and 
other members of the school community;

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school. 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

 

actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of 
the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

  Title I Priority and Focus Schools and the parents of students served in the Title I program must jointly agree 
upon the use of these additional funds to support increased parent engagement/education to enable parents 
to effectively support their child’s learning. 

  engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 

directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

  ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 

 

strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing 
technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills; 

  maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home; 

 

  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

  host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise 

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right 
to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 
and other applicable sections under the ESSA; 
schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the 
Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed; 
conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
We utilize the Teacher's College Reading and Writing assessments, which includes the running records for reading and on-
demand writing pieces. We also look at the Fundations, TERCS Investigations math checklists, teacher-created assessments, 
student work, and individual and small group conference notes to guide instructional planning for our ELLs.  Based on our data, 
most of our ELLs need extra support in reading and writing.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The TESOL teacher provides small group instruction with scaffolding and support for ENL students by providing push-in 
services as well as pull out services as needed.  The classroom teachers and the TESOL teacher work and plan collaboratively to 
provide differentiated instruction and modeling for the ENL students.  Weekly grade meetings are held for teachers to 
collaborate and plan for coherency.  The ENL Teacher also participates in these grade team meetings to discuss goals, plan for 
instruction and collaborate to meet the various needs of the ENL students.  Based on these collaborations and planning,  the

TESOL teacher provides instruction and support implementing the strategies from the Teachers College Reading and Writing 
Program, for all of the ENL students in the classrooms. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We utilize the EDAT based on the  NYSESLAT scores to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of our ENL students The final 
reading and writing running records data are the summative assessments that we utilize as baseline for the beginning of the 
school.  An additional data piece, which assists us with identifying the areas of need is the NYSESLAT exam.  The NYSITELL and 
the levels attained by the students are used as baseline for the beginning of the school.  Areas of need are continually assessed 
through the running records  and on-demand writing pieces from the Teachers College Reading and Writing Program. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

We currently implement the Response to Intervention model with teachers working collaboratively with the TESOL teacher to 
address tier I strategies that can be implemented into the classroom.  The NYSESLAT score reports are used to analyze all data 
for each student to recognize strengths and weaknesses across all four modalities of the English language, which include skills 
in listening, speaking, reading, and writing. These results are shared with administration, teachers, and parents.  Based on the 
summative data gathered from writing pieces, running records, and NYSESLAT scores, we provide AIS to students who will 
most benefit from these services. We then communicate this recommendation to the parents and guardians and receive 
consent to provide these AIS services and implement this program during the day. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
All of our Kindergarten and grade 1 teachers provide differentiated instruction for our ELLs with the collaboration of our ENL 
teacher as Tier 1 instruction. Tier 2 instruction is provided by our ENL teacher for an additional three periods in Grade 1 for our 
students who are in need of additional instructional support. We also provide additional at-risk related services, such as 
speech and Occupational Therapy.  We are also implementing an AIS program for at-risk students during the school day to 
provide extra support in literacy skills. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Combined assessment analysis utilizing a plethora of data such as the NYSITELL, NYSESLAT with the use of the EDAT tool, 
Fountas and Pinnell running records, Fundations assessments, reading and writing conferences, are part of evaluation and 
planning sessions.  Based on the analysis of these data, we plan accordingly to provide targeted instruction for students who 
need support in the specific modalities of reading, listening, speaking and writing.  We also use NYSESLAT summative data in 
order to group our ELLs by proficiency levels to maximize effective instruction in the classroom.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

There are multiple ways of communicating and disseminating the data analysis of our ELLs. There are the Instructional cabinet, 
staff PDs, grade meetings, SLTs, Coffee with the Principal, and PTA meetings, which allow for us to communicate what our next 
steps are with our current ELLs. During these grade level meetings, there is time for collaboration and communication among 
the classroom teachers and the TESOL teacher about the progress of our ENL students and the next steps required to support 
these students based on the data provided.

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Instruction is delivered as a push-in and pull out model for our entering and emerging students in 
Kindergarten.  Entering and emerging level ELLs are receiving 360 minutes of ENL instruction weekly (180 mins. Stand-
Alone ENL, 180 mins. Integrated ENL.) Transitioning level ELLs are receiving 180 minutes of ENL (90 minutes of 
Integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes of either Integrated ENL or Stand-Alone ENL. Expanding level ELLs receive 180 
minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA or other content area. Commanding level (proficient ELLs) are receiving 90 minutes of 
Integrated ENL/ELA or other content area per week by the classroom teachers. Former ELLs are also provided 
continuous instruction in small group settings by the classroom teachers. Progress monitoring is also established for 
these students to assess improvement and/or areas of need. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

NA  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Stand-Alone ENL services are delivered by the K-12 certified TESOL teacher.  Integrated ENL instruction is provided by the 
TESOL teacher and the classroom teachers.  The ESL push-in services are provided during the literacy block so that instruction 
and comprehension is maximized. English Language Learners are receiving the New York State mandated ENL/ELA allotted 
instruction time based on student proficiency levels achieved on individual NYSITELL and NYSESLAT data. Entering and 
emerging level ELLs are receiving 360 minutes of ENL instruction weekly (180 mins Stand-Alone ENL, 180 mins Integrated ENL.) 
Transitioning level ELLs are receiving 180 minutes of ENL (90 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes of either 
Integrated ENL or Stand-Alone ENL.  Expanding level ELLs receive 180 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA or other content 
area.  For the Kindergarten and 1st grade levels, the TESOL teacher provides small group instruction to the ENL students by 
providing support, scaffolding and reinforcing literacy skills when pushing into the classrooms during the literacy 
blocks.  Targeted instruction and one-on-one conferencing is provided by the TESOL teacher during these times as well.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
The Free-Standing ENL Program is taught in English.  The TESOL teacher provides scaffolding, one-on-one conferencing, 
classroom buddy who can provide Native language support, and Fundations instruction for phonemic awareness and phonics. 
Workshop  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

ELLs who are administered the NYSITELL and whose home language is Spanish, is administered the Spanish Lab if they are 
eligible for ENL services. Bilingual staff members are also involved in assisting the ENL students when needed. The native 
language is also integrated in the English language instructional program to support, build prior knowledge and clarify through 
peers, technology and bilingual staff members.  The TESOL teacher collaborates with the classroom teachers to provide 
cohesive instruction.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

a. 

SIFE   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. We have no SIFE students at this time, since the only grade we have is K for this school year.  
b. In order to provide support and differentiated instruction for our Newcomer ELLs, we provide small group work instruction 
by the TESOL teacher as well as the classroom teacher.  We implement progress monitoring to ensure that there is growth in 
the areas of reading, writing, listening and speaking skills.   If necessary, we provide Academic Intervention Services to our ENL 
students who would benefit from increased targeted instruction.  We allow the newcomers to feel safe and comfortable in 
their learning environment.  We have several staff members who can speak different languages to provide communication.  In 
our classroom libraries, we have early childhood grade picture books in the languages of Korean and Chinese, which are the 
prevalent languages being spoken in our school community.  In this way, we are able to provide a sense of familiarity to the 
Newcomer ELLs when they first enter.  They are also encouraged to speak or write in their native languages until they are able 
to fully communicate in both oral and written methods in order to express their thoughts to their teachers or peers.   
c. For our ELLs who are developing, we continue to provide support through small group instruction based on the Teachers 
College Reading and Writing Program.  We also continue to progress monitor and give support as needed as well as challenge 
when necessary.   Students are given many opportunities to communicate through their listening and speaking skills and 
to  participate in discussions with peers based on their reading and writing activities.   Students are encouraged to self- assess 
their understanding in order to take ownership of their learning and strive for excellence. 
d. We have no long term ELLs at this time, since ELL identification starts with the K grade. We have no FELLs at this time, since 
ELL identification starts with the K grade  
e.  We have one former ELL, currently in the 1st grade, who recently passed the NYSESLAT by receiving a Commanding level at 
the end of Kindergarten.  This student will continue to receive support from her classroom teachers for two continuous 
years.  The teachers will provide small group instruction during reading and writing workshop. The classroom teachers will also 
continue to progress monitor her growth and implement instruction based on formative assessments conducted in the 
classroom. If necessary, modifications will be made to the methods of instruction based on the student's growth and progress.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Strategies that we plan to use for ELL-SWDs to access academic content area and accelerate English language development 
are: collaborative learning, small group work, differentiation and scaffolding.  We will modify lessons and focus on the 
student's IEP goals and continue to communicate with their families about these modifications and goals.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Flexibility in scheduling, collaborative learning, small group instruction and focusing on IEP goals will allow students who are 
ELL-SWDs to attain success within the least restrictive environment.  We also have one ICT class on each grade level, both in 
Kindergarten and 1st grade for students who have disabilities to be in a least restrictive environment being instructed through 
a collaborative teaching approach.  Additional supports are provided when necessary, such as services from the Speech 
Therapist and Occupational Therapist.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math and other content areas include differentiation, scaffolding and targeted 
small group instruction within the classroom in collaboration with the TESOL teacher.  In addition to this, based on progress 
monitoring from reading running records from the Teachers College Reading and Writing Workshop, students will be 
recommended to receive AIS during the school day.  The extra instructional support will provide access to targeted instruction 
in literacy skills, which is currently most valuable for our ENL students in the early childhood grades.  As intervention services 
are provided, data from assessments will be gathered and monitored continually to drive instructional planning for the 
students who may need additional intervention services.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Based on our reading and writing assessment data from last year, we will continue to implement AIS programs during the 
school day to provide an extra form of support for the students who may need one-on-one, small group, differentiated and 
targeted instruction in phonemic awareness, reading, listening, writing and speaking skills.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELL students are afforded equal access to all school programs and supplemental services.  Communication in the form of 
letters and phone calls, are translated by parent volunteers as well as our staff members.  ELLs are given the same 
opportunities as the rest our student population.  Our ELLs participate in the after school program that is currently in our 
school. ELL students and their families are invited and have participated Computer Science workshops, Literacy and Math 
workshops.  We are also a school that implements the Leader In Me program, focusing on principles of being an effective 
leader that takes ownership in their learning and growing.  This program encourages all students to be leaders which includes 
the ENL population.  ENL students are also encouraged to part of the Student Government at our school.  All students as well 
as the ENL students are given access to services and programs at our school.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All of our classrooms are equipped with Promethean boards and docment readers, visual charts, allowing for teachers to 
provide for visuals and engaging lessons for our ENL students.  Students are also given access to borrow books from their 
classroom libraries based on their reading level, books that they want to explore, and books in their native language for 
Newcomer ELLs and online access to Raz-kids, which gives them a source to a variety of literacy materials at school and at 
home.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language support is assessed and delivered in the ENL program at our school. If needed, newcomer ENL students are 
encouraged to speak in their native language to the staff members and their peers, which will provide scaffolding for these 
students.   Students are also given access to books in their native languages, visuals and classroom buddy to help them get 
accustomed to the new environment.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Based upon most recent NYSESLAT/NYSITELL score data, we plan each ELLs' appropriate minutes of service according to the 
CR-Part 154.  The maximum allowable grade span for grouping instruction in grades K-12 is two contiguous grades, except for 
ELLs in a special class. We place our ELLs in the Kindergarten and 1st grade classrooms heterogeneously and plan strategically 
to meet the mandated minutes from CR-Part 154. We ensure that all required services are given by appropriate teachers and 
we enter this information into STARS.  All classroom teachers collaborate and plan with the TESOL teacher to provide effective 
and differentiated instruction.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
N/A 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Newly enrolled ELLs are assigned a classroom buddy who speaks the same language and to provide a sense of familiarity and 
support.  Students are also given visuals to assist them in communicating with students and their classroom 
teachers.  Kindergarten parents and families whose children are eligible for ENL services,  are given an orientation by the ENL 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

 

Coordinator.  This provides time for families to ask clarifying question about the ENL program and choose options for their 
children who are eligible for these services.  The ENL Coordinator also meets with the parents/guardians and conducts oral 
interviews during registration and informally interviews the student to see whether the child is eligible for the NYSITELL. The 
TESOL teacher communicates any necessary information with the parent during the registration.   In addition, Coffeee with 
Principal and a tour of the new building is provided by the principal during the beginning of the year for all newly enrolled 
students.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

N/A 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Throughout the school year, the ENL Coordinator attends ELL Professional Development provided by District 26 and Queens 
North, as well as other ELL Compliance Meetings.  All teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic staff also attend professional 
development meetings throughout the year and implement these strategies in the classrooms to support ELLs as they engage 
in Common Core Learning Standards.  Teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic staff have the opportunity to attend professional 
development provided by the Teachers College Reading Writing Workshop Program, Crisis Intervention, CS4ALL, Leader in Me, 
and Math workshops.  Teachers use information from these professional development meetings, to support students both 
academically and socio-emotionally.  Teachers are also given the opportunity to  turnkey this information and strategies 
to other classroom teachers during grade level and faculty meetings.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Each school must provide professional development to all teachers and administrators that specifically addresses the needs of 
English language learners. A minimum of fifteen percent of the required professional development hours for all teachers must 
be dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language 
and content instruction for English language learners.  This is provided by our Universal Literacy coach who visits biweekly, as 
well as our Teachers College Reading and Writing professional development coach and TCWRP Professional Development 
meetings.  For all bilingual and English as a new language teachers, a minimum of fifty percent of the required professional 
development hours must be dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction, including a 
focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English language 
learners.  The TESOL teacher attends the ENL professional development provided by the district.  Teachers are also encouraged 
to attend professional development opportunities during the summer.  All records for professional development activities, 
such as agendas and attendance, are kept in the main office, in the staff members' files.  Additionally, all teachers are 
encouraged to keep copies of all such records.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The annual individual meetings with parents will take place over the phone with interpretation if necessary.  The ENL teacher 
will take charge of these meetings after conferring with the student's classroom teacher on any issues, etc. Meetings will cover 
goals, areas of improvement, successes, parents questions/concerns, etc. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parents of ELL students are invited to all of our school activities which include Coffee with the Principal, PTA meetings, 
workshops, Library time, International food festival, Lunar New Year festival, Yoga workshops and other family 
workshops.  Notices in the various home languages are sent home with the students. .  The ENL teacher will call the parents 
regularly during Tuesday Parent Engagement time to encourage them to attend school activities and meetings, and to provide 
them with suggestions on how to support their children academically at home.  In addition, a monthly form of communication 
whether in person or via phone call, will be provided, to families

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Clara Kang, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Based on the data from ATS, Student Emergency Contact cards, and school and teacher surveys, we assess the 
need for home languages and to identify the greatest needs for interpretation and translation. The RCLP report is 
very helpful in determining what language for translation are preferred. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In the event of a school emergency, we have staff members who can speak Mandarin, Chinese, Korean and Spanish 
and can assist with contacting families. We also have a parent volunteer who comes to school and translates 
important notices in Chinese. The majority of the teachers use Google translate and other methods to communicate 
with families for various reasons. In addition, a parent-established WeChat allows for Chinese-speaking parents to 
have a forum to post questions and receive answers by one of our PTA executive board members.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Staff members will be aware of the goal of the Chancellor's Regulation A-663 through professional development days 
provided by the administration. The staff members are also encouraged to use the Class Dojo and Remind apps and 
use the Google Translate that is linked to the apps to communicate with the families. In addition, we have staff 
members who speak Mandarin, Cantonese, Spanish and Korean to assist with communication.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

We will have translated signage for all important documents including the Chancellor's backpack home letters, which 
may not have the translated versions available. Flyers will be distributed to the Chinese-speaking parents via WeChat, 
which was parent-created and allows parents to post questions about anything school-related.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

PTA meetings, Coffee with the Principal, SLT meetings, teacher meetings are all ways that we are gathering feedback 
from parents. Last year, we received feedback that it would be great to have someone interpret Mandarin once a 
week in the main office, since our school nor our secretary speaks that. We were able to find a parent volunteer who 
came in on a weekly basis on Monday mornings to assist with interpretation. This included phone calls and face-to-
face meetings.
