Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

 

 

The Oliver Wendell Holmes School strives to provide a safe environment with social emotional supports that will have 
a positive effect on students’ learning. We encourage our students to become self-reliant and capable of developing 
and applying their skills and abilities to succeed in all areas of life. We have high expectations and believe all our 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

students will rise to the challenging rigors of the Common Core. Our school recognizes the unique characteristics of 
each individual and the importance of providing the guidance and support to grow socially, emotionally and 
academically. Our overall mission is to prepare every student for excellence through rigorous academics by creating a 
student centered school environment in which students embody our school's core values (Honesty, Leadership, 
Perseverance, & Growth Mindset) promoting student achievement and college/career readiness. 

The administration, staff, and parents collaborate to devise school-wide goals and implement plans that encompass 
all the ingredients necessary to successfully educate, and encourage our students to become productive citizens and 
lifelong learners. 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The Oliver Wendell Holmes School is a middle school located in Long Island City, Queens. The school’s student 
population is 59% Hispanic, 17% Black, 15% Asian; 6% white, and the remaining 3% of students are comprised of other 
ethnicity's. 28% of the students at OWH have an IEP and another 17% are ENL students. All students are eligible for 
free lunch. The school’s attendance rate is approximately 93.7%. 

Teachers at OWH receive professional development that is tailored to their needs and teacher leaders collaborate 
with other schools to improve pedagogy and instruction, as well as share best practices. OWH is committed to helping 
students be college and career ready by expanding their knowledge through STEM and project-based learning. Our 
school's Dual Language program is entering it's third year (for SY 18-19) and for SY 18-19 our school will have a NEST 
program. An area of strength is our school's many partnerships with CBOs; specifically Greater Ridgewood Youth 
Council, CUNY Creative Arts Team, City Year, Intrepid and the Museum of Moving Image. OWH has built a strong 
community in which parents, teachers and the community all work together to support the social and emotional 
needs of our students. 

Additional collaborations link the school to the families and community members of the Long Island City/Astoria 
community. The Greater Ridgewood Youth Council Beacon Program, Youth Police Academy and City Year provide the 
OWH community with programs and activities that lead to families and the community supporting the school.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

28% Special Education and 17% ENL (student needs necessitate providing additional AIS and intervention programs to 
support these students academically as well as a variety of elective classes to access students' diverse talents and 
incorporate their learning styles as well as support them with literacy skills for multiple learners and problem solving 
skills. ) 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

OWH has made strong community ties and worked with families to ensure our students will be college and career 
ready. As a school community, we will continue working on rigorous instruction and our school's instructional core. 
The school’s instructional focus for the 2018-2019 school year is to use assessment data to make instructional 
adjustments (to curricula/unit plans) and inform instruction by including the four Advanced Literacy Hallmarks, 
appropriate scaffolds and extensions in all content areas which will cognitively engage and prepare students for the 
21st century. With the rigorous academic demands of today and in an effort to ensure that all students are college 
and career ready, it is imperative that student assessment data is used to appropriately and strategically support all 
students in order to maximize student learning outcomes and prepare instruction that is challenging for all students.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
The schools strengths are summarized below: 

-All grades ELA Findings: There was an 8% increase in proficiency for all student groups performing at levels 3 and 4 on 
the 2018 NYS ELA exam from 29% 2017 to 37%.  

-All grades Math Findings: There was an 10% increase in proficiency for all student groups performing at levels 3 and 4 
on the 2018 NYS Math exam from 22% 2017 to 32%. 

The school's priority needs are as followed: 

-State test data indicates that AYP was not met with specific subgroups (Special Education, ENL, Black, & Latino). Our 
school's proficiency in Math is 32% and 37% in ELA (from SY 17-18). Reviewing math item skills analysis; many 
students did not make progress in multiple math standards. Sixth graders fared worse than grades seven or eight. Our 
students need to make marked gains on multiple choice sections of summative assessments.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, resulting from staff involvement in the school's advanced literacy initiative to infuse academic vocabulary 
across all content areas, students will show a 5% increase in school created end of year assessments in ELA and Math as 
compared to the fall baseline.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Teachers of all content areas will continue to review, revise and 
make curricular adjustments to infuse literacy in all content 
areas. A variety of assessment data will inform lesson planning 
(Danielson 1e) to provide appropriate scaffolds and extensions to 
allow all students to master the more rigorous curricula. We will 
continue to put strategies in place to address the needs of SWD's 
and ELL's and other high need student subgroups will include 
station teaching, parallel teaching, individualized 
scaffolds/modifications, adaptive technology (myON, Readworks, 
iPads, Laptops, Interactive Boards), and infusing language 
objectives into daily practice.  

Teachers will meet regularly (teacher teams/grade 
teams/department teams/inquiry teams/instructional cabinet) 
with to incur resources through which the curriculum can be 
supplemented and enhanced to meet the needs of all learners. 

Effectiveness of the enhanced curricula will be assessed by all 
teacher teams and administrators by analyzing student work and 
assessments . 

Additional revisions and modifications to curricula, assessments 
and to individual teacher lesson plans will be made on an 
ongoing basis throughout the year as needed based on trends 
identified in unit assessment and student work.  

Through monthly department newsletters and participation in 
student led conferences parents will learn more about the 
curricula and their child's progress.  

All parents

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In our school's most recent Quality Review, we received a Well Developed in teacher support. Our current 
observation trends indicate that our teachers need support in Danielson’s Domains 1a, 1e, 3b, 3c, and 3d. During SY 
17-18, 36% of teachers were rated developing and 5% of teachers were rated ineffective in Domain 3. Furthermore, 
based on school survey results, 39% of students felt personal attention and support indicating a need for teachers to 
improve in 2a. Therefore, our focus and priority needs is to deepen academic rigor in planning and instruction to 
ensure every student makes progress and teachers need to build deeper connections with their students. We will 
deepen academic rigor through observation feedback, professional development, instructional cabinet, and adjusting 
the curriculum and advisory activities to meet the needs of our students.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 60% of teachers will show growth in Danielson's Domain 3 as measured by Advance data from June 2018.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met.

2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. IS 204Q, Oliver Wendell Holmes School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of 
Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community.  

IS 204's Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 
The Oliver Wendell Holmes School will support parents and families of Title I students by:

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

OWH will be offering after-school and Saturday Academy classes during SY 2018-19 for all 
current 6th, 7th and 8th grade ENL students to target their learning needs. The program will run 
begin  in the Fall and run through the Spring. This program will also be offered to all SIFE as 
well as long term English Language Learners. The program will run from 8:00 AM until 12:00 
PM  for 20 sessions.  A program notification in the parent's preferred  language will be sent 
home with the student in order to sign up for the program. Once the program begins daily 
attendance will be taken.  This will support the school in making AYP in ELA with our ELL 
students, since we did not meet our AYP this year.   
Four dually certified teachers ENL/Special Education will be teaching the program. The 
instructional focus will be on developing and improving reading, writing, listening and speaking 
skills using ENL strategies and methodologies to help ENL students acquire the academic 
English language and skills necessary for higher achievement. Students will be engaged in 
activities using News ELA, Test Prep books, hands on projects,   Consistent use of 
differentiation, small group instruction, scaffolding techniques, questioning, visuals, and frequent 
opportunities for interaction and discussion will be used in the classroom. Teachers will  provide 
direct instruction as well as team teaching, station teaching, and flexible groupings during the 
course of the program.  
Teachers will maintain the program notifications and student attendance and track student 
progress on an Excel or Access database.   Students will be grouped by NYSESLAT levels and 
the ratio will be 12 students per teacher in each class. 
The ENL program will focus on language acquisition helping ENL students  make academic 
progress. Teachers' lessons will be based on the common core learning 
standards, NYSESLAT reading, writing, speaking, and listening scores, and scores 
from ELA, MOSL data and Math Baseline Assessments. The three classes will be grouped 
according to grade level. The classes will focus on all four modalities of the NYSESLAT test 
which will include writing, reading, listening and speaking activities necessary for making better 
gains on learning the English language and on the NYSESLAT, ELA and other testing. 
Native language support such as bilingual glossaries tutorials in using Google translate, native 
language classroom libraries, Ipad use in vocabulary development, comprehension and 
translation, as well as the buddy system will be used to aid in students language development.
  Students will be able to use glossaries and Google translate at home.  Online curricular 
resources also employ google translate so that parents can help support students at home with 
homework.   
Students will be engaged in various activities that will include reading comprehension, citing 
evidence, vocabulary development, listening and speaking, grammar, the writing process, 
working in groups and pairs etc.  Materials are supplemental and distinct from those used for 
daily instruction(translated documents/myON/Readworks/online intervention programs/test prep 
books).   
A rich program of after-school activities take place three days a week (Tuesday - Thursday from 
2:30 PM until 5:30 PM from September until June). These services are provided by the CBO 
City Year  Program and through GRYC Beacon. These programs range from academically

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
IS204Q has a plan for ongoing professional development during the new scheduled PD block. 
Some topics that will be presented during these professional development periods are: 
ENL strategies/Instructional Supports 
ENL mandates and standards 
ENL testing (NYSITELL & NYSESLAT) 
Language objectives to address ENL/CR-Part 154 
ENL teachers will also attend professional development in and out of our school and turn-key to 
all staff members. The need for the additional PD is that our many of our students do not 
improve on the NYSESLAT, not have we met AYP with our ELLs, and the teachers need 
additional strategies and ideas in ways to support ELLs. 
To assist the title III teacher's with monitoring the progress of the students in the title III 
program, the Title III teachers meet with the AP to look at student data and plan for the 
instruction of their ELL's, which includes differentiation, grouping, writing interventions for 
ELL’s and NYSESLAT Test Preparation. Additionally, teachers use common planning (once a 
week) built into their programs to share best practices and to plan collaboratively. 
A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of required professional development hours for all teachers 
prescribed by CR Part 80 will be dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best 
practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for 
ELLs.  Professional development as required by NYS CR Part 154 is provided at I.S. 204 on 
designated (Mondays and Professional Learning Days). ENL teachers will attend outside 
workshops as needed. 
Teachers participate weekly in lesson studies to improve their pedagogy and to differentiate their 
instruction to meet the various needs of all English Language Learners. These professional 
development workshops take place every Monday afternoon for 50 minutes and have been 
ongoing since the first week of the school year. These professional development sessions will 
continue until the end of the school.  
Every Title III service provider attends weekly common grade meetings (40 minutes in length) 
where the teachers have the opportunity to discuss student progress, strengths and areas for 
improvement. The Title III teachers are then able to use this information to target and adjust their 
instruction during the morning program. 
Additional professional development workshops are conducted Monday afternoons by the lead 
teachers (content certified: ELA, Math, Social Studies and Science) through the school 
year.  Topics include but are not limited to the ENL Classroom,  Building Academic Vocabulary 
for English Language Learners, Cooperative Learning Classrooms, Setting Student Goals and 
Differentiating Instruction to reach all ELL's . All teachers including the Title III service 
providers attend these professional development workshops. Each session is 50 minutes in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44

length. For each professional development session an agenda is maintained  and participants 
attending are required to sign in on an attendance sheet. 
On going professional development will positively impact the quality of classroom instruction, 
improve the implementation of new initiatives and aid in raising student achievement by 
providing teachers with strategies for ELLs and additional ways of modifying instruction and 
scaffolding for ELLs.   

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact 
higher achievement for ELLs.  NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as 
parent orientation during ELL identification process.

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
I.S. 204Q provides numerous opportunities for ENL parents to attend informative workshops. 
1.The ENL Coordinator offers orientation workshops to the parents of new incoming ENLs. 
NYSESLAT workshops will also be offered to provide parents with a better understanding and 
changes on the state test. 
2. The parent coordinator conducts meetings for parents to formulate suggestions, and to 
participate, as appropriate, in decisions about the education of their children. 
3. The ENL coordinator conducts parent workshops for ENL parents regarding standards based 
instructional activities.  Parents of Title III students as well as parents of ELLs will participate in 
these activities by  engaging in practices that will support their child’s growth, learning, and 
development at home.   
3. Translators are provided at meetings to help parents in their native language. The translation 
needs of parents will be met (notification of events in the home language as per LTI plan.)   
4. Parents are notified through backpacked fliers, monthly calendars and the school phone 
message system. 
5. ENL classes are offered to parents during the day (through a parent outreach CBO).

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Data gathered through teacher created assessments, standardized exams, interim assessments, teacher created Dual 
Language Assessments (baseline),  conferencing and other informal assessments demonstrates a need for ELL’s on the area of 
reading and vocabulary comprehension. ELL students struggle expressing their ideas both orally and in writing. Students tend 
to answer literal questions and struggle to expand on questions that require critical thinking skills. Students struggle with 
comprehension of academic text. Using this data the ENL department has worked with teachers across subject areas to infuse 
ENL methodologies in their pedagogy to address these needs. Approximately eighteen percent of our ENL population are long 
term ELL’s. To accommodate their needs with language acquisition they are invited to before and after school 
programs.  Portfolios are created for all ELL’s to ensure that students are making progress.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

 

Grade teams, teacher teams, department teams, tailored professional development, & assessments reviewed by the 
aforementioned teams. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We look at individual student progress and how many students improve on the NYSESLAT and in each modality as well as ELA 
state exams and school unit assessments.   We also use edperformance.com data to measure progress.  Students need to grow 
in language development and vocabulary.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Co-teachers use data to plan lessons through station teaching, parallel teaching, and student centers.  Teacher teams will 
identify students to attend upcoming Title III intervention programs as well. ENL classes are also provided with push-in 
AIS teachers to provided smaller group support.    Teachers will receive continuous training and support  to address ELL's. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Data specialists desegregate a variety of student data and provide teachers with information on student progress.  In addition, 
they will examine achievement at the classroom level. Students are targeted and screened during teacher teams and ENL 
strategies and methodologies are used to scaffold tasks for students.  Students are also invited and encouraged to attend after 
school and early morning literacy programs.     Students will receive AIS via small group instruction (Tier 1 and Tier 
2).   Throughout the year, teacher teams will progress monitor and make appropriate curricula adjustments. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Students are more successful on the listening and speaking modalities and struggle with reading and writing modalities.      
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Teacher teams analyze the data through inquiry work and teacher teams.  With the data, teachers use target intervention to 
address the needs of our  ENL students (station teaching, AIS, myOn, appropriate scaffolds, etc.) 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Students are placed in classes on their NYSESLAT scores and mandates of CR-Part 154.  There is also one class per 
grade that has ESL classes taught by certified ESL pedagogues, programmed into their school day.  An integrated 
model for ENL is implemented into content area classes (including special education classes) to fulfill time 
requirements and support students Integrated and stand-alone models are implemented based off of ENL mandates.   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A   

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

To ensure that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to the students proficiency levels, all 
students were placed in classes based on the required number of minutes as per CR-Part 154 requirements for each level so 
that ENL teachers can push-into classes and also provide ENL classes.    ENL teachers will ensure students receive systematic 
instruction that is carefully structured and sequenced.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Core content is delivered through small group and whole group instruction (e.g. Team Teaching Model--Station and parallel 
teaching).  ENL teachers and content teachers have an opportunity to collaborate during teacher team time. Core content is 
delivered through station and team teaching. Effective ENL methodology and strategies are infused in content area instruction 
to enable ELL students to access prior knowledge, learn content material and communicate ideas. Visual aides and graphic 
organizers are used to infuse ENL strategies into content areas. Rather than pulling students out of their grade level classroom, 
this program model brings the ENL specialist into classrooms.Technology aides, such as the Interactive Activ board were added 
to classrooms to aid in instruction as well as glossaries and ipads.  Student to student discussion is also encouraged during all 
classes to promote speaking and listening skills.     
 
In our Spanish Dual Language program, content is delivered in 50% English and 50% Spanish and students are serviced by 
licensed bilingual teachers.  Dual language teachers collaborate to adjust the curriculum to meet the needs of their students 
and to share resources translated from English to Spanish.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

We have seasoned pedagogues with experience dealing with high ENL populations interview parents/students and review the 
home language survey.  They also administer the the NYSISTEL.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

SIFE students are offered and have priority in participating in extended day  activities which include academic classes to 
increase literacy and mathematics.  Scaffolds are used throughout the school day. 
All ENL students' NYSESLAT, MoSL, edperformance, and various assessments are disaggregated and used to determine 
scaffolds for tasks and based on level and progress of their language acquisition.  Students (newcomer and developing) that 
receive stand alone ENL classes receive explicit instruction to develop their speaking, listening,  reading and writing proficiency 
(team teaching). Teachers meet during common planning to discuss specific instructional needs and accommodations 
(extended time, use of glossaries, etc).  Literacy is developed in individual, guided and group  instruction. Former ELLs are 
given their accommodations and their scaffolding is designed as needed based on language needs and or skill deficits (team 
teaching and station teaching via small group instruction).    
 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
All students including ELL/SWDs are required to meet the mandates of of standards aligned curricula.  Teachers certified in ENL 
and content teachers modify and adapt curricula and instruction based on student's needs and as per their IEP goals and 
recommendations.  Tasks are tiered and differentiated to provide multiple entry points for all students to access the curricula. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

When required, an alternate placement para has been utilized to meet the mandates of students requiring bilingual instruction 
as per their IEP.    Team teaching, station teaching, and parallel teaching are pedagogical methodologies to support ELL-SWD's 
with academic content and language acquisition.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Students were grouped in classes based on their IEP needs and NYSESLAT scores.  Teacher programs were designed to 
accommodate students needs in the least restrictive environment and ensure that all mandates were met.  As an example, ICT 
classes have students that are designated ICT as per their IEPs, but also require ENL services.    Co-teachers also use station 
teaching to provide students with small group instruciton.  OWH made program adjustments by departmentalizing teacher 
schedules to ensure they are experts in their content area.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Teachers are collaborating to share resources translated from English to Spanish across all content areas.  The OWH Saturday 
College Access for All Academy is offered to targeted ELL students.    All non-ELA/ENL teachers and ELA/ENL teachers are 
collaborating in teacher teams  to ensure that ENL methodologies as well as the Advanced Literacy Hallmarks are infused 
across all content areas. Students receive tier II instruction as per ensuring  ENL mandated students receive extra support in 
ELA and Math.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

3rd year Spanish Dual Language, a Debate class to encourage discussion, Real World Writing, Real World Math, vertical 
programming, incorporating language objectives in the the learning target or focus question, station teaching, myON, Reading 
Works, & Post Secondary Readiness. The classes and programs ensure students learn how effectively problem solve by infusing 
language development skills.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ENL Students are afforded equal access to all school programs throughout OWH. All ENL students receive the same cluster 
classes as all other students in the school; art, music, health, foreign language.  ENL students are also invited to participate in 
various enrichment programs. These programs provide ENL’s with the opportunity to develop language speaking skills in a 
social setting and to explore other talents and interests. These include basketball, soccer, Literacy club, Teen Thursday, City 
Year, Title III Saturday program, national junior honors society and Intrepid. During parent engagement activities, the programs 
are presented to the parents and applications are distributed.  Approximately 70% of our ENLs participate in the 
aforementioned programs.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
A variety of instructional resources are utilized during the school day to support our ENL students.  SS Passport Curriculum, 
Teacher Created Resources from Spanish to English, Ipads,  dictionaries and glossaries are used to support language 
instruction. Multicultural literature representative of the various cultures are used inside the classroom. Manipulative and 
visual aids are used to scaffold instruction for ELL’s. Every classroom is equipped with an interactive white board to aid in 
instruction.      
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language support is delivered in our ENL program through independent reading. Our students have the opportunity in 
social settings such as lunch and extended day programs to speak in their native language. Additional support is given through 
the use of buddy learning partners as well as our staff members who speak many of the same native languages as or ELL 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

students.    Home language support is delivered throughout the course of the school day and students have access to multiple 
resources in each program model.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  
All school resources and materials are developmentally and age appropriate for middle school students and aligned to 
CCLS and we are currently realigning the curricula to the Next Gen Standards.  Services, curricula and daily instruction are 
tailored to meet the cognitive demands of our ENL students as per their ENL mandates. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
A variety of instructional resources are utilized during the school day. Ipads,  dictionaries and glossaries are used to support 
language instruction. Multicultural literature representative of the various cultures are used inside the classroom. 
Manipulatives and visual aids are used to scaffold instruction for ELL’s. Every classroom is equiped with an interactive white 
board to aid in instruction.      
Please note, schools are two different grade levels with different student populations and do not share resources for ENL 
students.   
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
To assist newly enrolled ENL students before the beginning of the school year, we hold an orientation day. During this day, 
parents and students are invited to the school to meet the teachers and administration. Students take a tour of the building 
and learn about the programs we offer.  During the summer months we will offer a two week bridge program to all of our 
incoming sixth graders. Students who participate in the bridge program are assessed to further inform curricular adjustments 
and scaffolds that will be included into curricula.  The students also have the opportunity to meet other incoming sixth graders 
as well as develop their language skills in a social and more relaxed academic setting.  Students who enroll into 
OWH throughout the year will have orientation with the school counselor and teachers.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Italian, Arabic, Greek, & Spanish 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

a.)    The dual language model being used is self-contained with the teacher providing instruction in both 
English and Spanish using the 50/50 alternating day model.  Language is organized and clearly designated 
by color codes.   
b.)  Science-Spanish & English  / Social Studies-Spanish & English / NLA- Spanish only 
 
c.)  Color coated on alternating days.  i.e. by designated days of week. 
 
d.) Both languages are taught at the same time.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Contractual staff development hours and days (Mondays 2:20 - 4:00) are utilized to provide all staff with the necessary ELL 
professional development as well as election day and the Chancellors day.   The entire staff was trained by Goldmansour and 
Rutherford on best practices with co-teach and serving struggling students (IEP, ENL, at risk, etc.)  The entire staff was also 
trained in social/emotional learning by Power Brain and the CUNY Creative Arts Team in which promotes language acquisition 
development.   
 
 When available, teachers are sent to various professional development workshops offered by the Office of English Language 
Learners, which includes PD to support ENL students in accessing Common Core standards, and teaching ELL students with 
disabilities. These staff members then turn key to the rest of the staff.  Other support staff such as our secretaries, school 
aides, and parent coordinator are aware of our ENL students and are provided with the guidelines of CRP-154.       
 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 Our school assists incoming ENL students in the transition from elementary to middle school by opening our doors for an open 
house/orientation. Our school also invites elementary students to participate in a grade bridge summer program.  Additionally, 
we will be meeting with main feeder elementary schools to gather valuable data on incoming ENL students and their needs in 
order to ensure they are supported as soon as they enter and are correctly placed.   In order to support the ENL student’s 
transition from middle school to high school, the guidance department offers High School open houses, inter school visitations, 
information meetings, and small group counseling. Our guidance counselors receive outside training throughout the school 
year in order to assist ENL's as they transition. 
Since the school has a significant ENL population and many teachers teach ENL students, all teacher teams and Monday 
professional learning opportunities infuse ENL strategies and methodologies for supporting these students.  This is beneficial in 
that while strategies may be learned that have been identified as helping ELL students, these strategies can benefit  a variety 
of learners.  All records for PD activities are maintained by lead teachers and the AP.             
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
All meetings have translation/interpretation services as needed.   During SLT and PTA meetings data  and supports for ENL's is 
discussed with parents.  We have ESL classes for parents and teachers always include information regarding ENL and how 
parents can support their children with the rigors of the curricula.  The teachers share strategies that they use with the 
students and how instruction is scaffolded.  Additionally, during Student Led Conferences, students assess their own goals and 
show their language development progress and share assessment results in all content areas.  Since many staff members 
speak many  of the languages represented in our school they are available to assist parents and clarify questions they may 
have.       

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

The parent coordinator of IS 204 schedules parent workshops that target the needs of all students. These workshops include 
but are not limited to, the high school application process, PupilPath,  CCLS,  Special Education services, ENL services. 
Translation is available at every meeting. We conduct monthly Parent Teacher Association meetings. Notices and letters are 
translated to keep parents informed of school events and educational programs .   We also distribute monthly curriculum 
parent newsletters to inform parents about what their child is learning.  Additionally, Pupil path translates all teacher/parent 
correspondence into the parents' home language and back to English for the teachers.  Phone messenger/Blackboard connect 
communicates with parents in their home language as noted in ATS.  
 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
Implementing station teaching/co-teaching model  in at least 65% of our classrooms has been a success.  Based off of Advance 
data, teacher planning is evident and student engagement has increased.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Faye Erstejn-Kotzer, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,  
interpretation, compliance and budget.  
 

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The school uses the HLIS and parent interview to determine the perferred oral and written languages for parents 
of new admits. We also use ATS Home Language reports (for students that are list-noticed to the school or 
transfer as well as feedback from parents and school anecdotal data. Our parent coordinator makes arrangements 
for translations during parent workshops, parent information nights, meetings and award ceremonies. The LAP 
team review the data periodically to ensure that surveys and parental contacts are translated in all languages 
represented by our families.
