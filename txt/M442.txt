Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

At Ballet Tech we believe children learn best by constructing knowledge in a teacher facilitated environment. For 
students to grow, teachers must know their students academically, socially, emotionally, and support their growth 
from that position. We believe students learn best in a safe, supportive, collaborative environment with a coherent 
curriculum based on the Common Core standards.  

Key features of our beliefs include:  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

● Students engaged in both short and long term learning targets.  

● Student centered lessons.  

● Students learning through academic discussions / questioning.  

● Frequent formative assessments driving instruction.  

● Students revising work based upon self-assessment along with peer and /or teacher feedback.  

Our mission is to ensure that every student graduates from our school prepared to continue on their path toward 
attending college as a critically thinking adult.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Our collaboration with Ballet Tech Foundation is designed to ensure that our students not only have exceptional 
academic opportunities, but also have access to a program that trains them in classical dance and sets them on a 
path toward a professional career as a dancer.  

Our partnership with the non-profit Ballet Tech Foundation enables Ballet Tech / NYC Public School for Dance to 
integrate an academic education with pre-professional ballet training. With both academic classrooms and dance 
studios on-site, students are able to take a rigorous schedule of dance classes as part of the regular school day. In 
addition to providing the rigorous training necessary to be on a path to a professional career, Ballet Tech 
Foundation provides opportunities for students to perform in professional settings. Ballet Tech’s student 
performance troupe, Kids Dance prepares students for professional work experiences. In June 2017-18 Kids Dance 
presented six performances at the Joyce Theater. Kids Dance will return to the Joyce once again, June 2019. 

Whether or not they become professional dancers, Ballet Tech’s students are poised for success. The rigorous 
academic and dance training fosters all the academic behaviors we strive to develop in our young learners: 
perseverance, self-reflection/regulation, strong work habits, and collaboration.  

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Ballet Tech has a very small special education population. We have five students receiving SETSS and two students 
receiving mandated counseling, services are provided on site. This year we have 4 ELL students in need of additional 
supports: Three 4th graders at the "expanding" level and one 6th grade at the "transitional" level. All their needs are 
met on site with ELL teacher. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

This year we made the most progress in the area of building strong family and community ties. We organized several 
school-wide activities to engage our parents: Multicultural Dinner, NY Mets outing, Family trip to Bronx Zoo. In 
addition Our Open Class Week , Art Show to our Poetry Cafe, were very well received by our families. We continued 
our partnership with the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Through one fo their consultants, we were 
able to access resources and refer families to City resources for counseling when needed. As mentioned in the goal 
section below, our key area of focus will be ensuring that our Science course of study meets the the new NY State 
Science Standards. We will focus on implementing our new Core Science curricula, Amplify, to ensure our students are 
engaging in the three dimensions of NYSSS: Students will engage in science and engineering practices, students will

develop understanding of core ideas, students will engage with crosscutting concepts. We will also focus on making 
sure that our teachers have opportunities to collaborate and learn from teachers in other schools.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
 

This year we continued to focus on student writing with additional writing opportunities provided in content areas. 
We built upon our progress from last year and ensured that all students were producing and publishing multiple 
pieces of writing. In addition to our ELA course, students engaged in argument writing in the S.S. and Science course. 
Teachers continued to use Lucy Calkins’, Units of Study in Writing, to both teach and evaluate student writing. In our 
most recent Quality Review (2016) we were “well developed” in both 2.2 and 1.2 (Evaluating student work and 
effective teaching methods respectively).  

Student writers developed critical thinking skills as they were challenged to analyze mentor text and their own writing 
in order to make improvements. In analyzing our June instructional reports 2018, our students are once again about 
20% above the NYC average in the “writing to sources” sections. School-wide, our students are earning 83% of the 
possible points available on the "all writing to sources" questions: essay and short response. 

While our 89% of our fourth grade students score a level 3 or 4 on the NYS Science test, we have identified a need to 
revise our current curriculum to address the newly adopted NYS Science Standards. After a review of our science units 
of study, sample lessons, and assessments, it is clear we need do not yet address all the core ideas, engineering 
practices, and crosscutting concepts listed in the standards.  

For the 2018-19 school year, our priority need is to strengthen our elementary Science course of study to ensure that 
our students are engaged with the newly adopted NYSSS. This year we will fully implement our newly adopted core 
science curriculum, Amplify science, with the goal of engaging students in using scientific and engineering practices 
and applying crosscutting concepts a tools to develop understanding, and the ability to solve challenging problems 
related to core ideas.  

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
 

By June 2019, 95% of our fourth grade students will score a level 3 or 4 on the NYS Science Test.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
In our most recent NYC School Survey (2018), we averaged 92% positive comments on all the components that make 
up the “Supportive Environment” section of the survey. Our 2016 QR rated us as Well Developed in 3/5 of the quality 
indicators. Last year we worked towards improving how we set goals for our most struggling learners with a focus on 
strengthening their reading skills. Through an after school intervention program and dedicated small group guided 
reading instruction, we showed improved results in our Fauntas & Pinnell reading levels for our most struggling 
readers. (Averaging 3-5 reading level gains). These students received Personal Intervention Plans (PIPS) that included 
SMART goals for improvement.  

While our School Survey scores exceed district and city averages in the area of supportive environment there is one 
section that needs improvement. Fifty - one percent of the MS students surveyed responded positively to the 
questions about being supported by teachers when they are upset. While this is higher than both city and district 
averages, we want to see that number increase dramatically.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
 

The 2018-19 NYC School Survey results will show at least a 10% increase in positive student responses to questions 
around receiving support with emotional distress.

development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

This past year our teachers collaborated well in their team meetings. The most recent NYC School Survey 2018 
revealed that 100% of teachers responded positively to “peer collaboration” questions. They collaborated to plan 
units of study, revise curricula, align curricula across grade levels, and set standards for writing across the school. In 
addition, our most recent QR (2016) rated 4.2 teacher teams as proficient citing evidence of collaborative planning.  

 

While the NYC School Survey revealed teachers willingness to collaborate in planning and making the school run 
smoothly, the survey also revealed that teachers would like more time to collaborate with other educators around 
professional development. Only 33% of teachers said they have opportunities to work effectively with teachers from 
other schools. Our next step in strengthening teacher collaboration is to ensure that all teachers have more 
opportunities to collaborate with each other and teachers from other schools in order to grow professionally. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, all teachers will have at least two opportunities to participate in a cycle of professional learning that 
includes teachers from other schools. These cycles will include time for inter-visitations, planning, implementing, and 
reflecting on their learning.

Administration and 
Teacher leaders 

Teachers and administrators will collaborate to create the 
yearlong PD calendar based on teacher observation reports and 
teachers’ self-evaluations. During September Monday PD 
sessions teacher teams will establish their learning teams around 
a shared interest: strengthening discussions, creating more 
student centered learning, effective strategies to monitor 
behavior…etc. 

 

Teacher teams will develop cycles of learning in collaboration 
with administration using available resources: Centrally provided 
PD, MFSC provided PD, engageNY, Danielsons’ “Implementing 
the Framework”. At least two of the learning cycles will include 
learning with teachers from other schools. 

 

 

Since we have not set protocols for inter-visitations, we will 
spend two sessions of PD developing protocols for visits using 
the NYCDOE Handbook for Professional Development. This cycle 
will include: 

All Teachers  November / 

December 

2018 

Adminstration and 
teacher leaders. 

  Connecting inter-visitations to Danielson’s Framework 
  Create objectives for visits and connect to larger 

instructional focus. 
Set expectations for before, during, and after the visits. 

 
  Tie in student work. 
  Reflect and Revise 

To build school-wide instructional coherence, team meetings will 
have multiple opportunities for teachers to share best practices 
and turnkey learning from outside PD.

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Collaborative Teachers and strategies 
to promote teacher-parent/family collaborations in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and 
identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
Teacher-parent collaborations will continue to be developed through our Scool Leadership Team and PTA. In 
September 2018 our SLT we will share our approved goals with our PTA. We will promote teacher/parent 
collaborations to support this goal:   

  PTA funding substitutes to cover classes when teachers visit other schools or attend outside PD 
 

Some teacher PD will be appropriate for parent workshops. ( PD around social emotional learning...) Teachers 
will create relevant workshops for parents to share their PD learning. (Nov. 2018, March 2019)

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

Our most recent school survey (2018) shows that we average 92% positive comments on the “effective school 
leadership” sections: inclusive leadership, teacher influence, program coherence, instructional leadership. Ballet 
Tech’s 2016 Quality Review shows a rating of highly effective in the categories of communicating high expectations 
and establishing an instructional coherence leading to students thinking critically in all classrooms. 

 

Our 2016 Quality Reviewer also recommended a more targeted approach to professional development for our 
teachers. Cycles of professional learning can be designed to meet specific needs of teachers. Outcomes of the 
professional learning can be more effectively measured by student outcomes. Our priority need in this area for 2018-
19 is to ensure that teachers take leadership roles in delivering cycles of PD and all teachers have an opportunity to 
learn from their colleagues. We also need to ensure that our teachers have opportunities to collaborate with teachers 
from other schools to strengthen teaching and student learning.

Our most recent NYC School Survey illustrates the strong ties between Ballet Tech and our families. Both the outreach 
and involvement sections of the survey show 96% of the comments are positive. In addition, we have very good 
turnouts for our school-wide events: Parent Teacher Conferences, Open Class Weeks, Joyce Theater Performances, 
Art Show, Poetry Café, Parent Workshops. This year we also developed partnerships with NYC Department of Health 
and Hygiene. Some of our families required counseling support for their family / child and we were able to provide 
referrals to our community partners.  

 

This year, our priority is to connect families with cultural institutions in the city that will support their child’s learning. 
Our teachers have many connections with organizations and frequently take students on field trips; however, we 
don’t yet help families make connections with these institutions.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Ballet Tech, NYC Public School for Dance, in compliance with the Section 1118 
of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Ballet Tech, NYC Public School for Dance will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Ballet Tech uses the Fountas and Pinnell system to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs. Running records are conducted 
once in the fall and once in the spring to find out students' reading levels. Thus far, the data has shown that the reading levels 
of our ELLs range from P to V. This information informs the instructional plan of the ELA and ESL teachers as they teach to the 
student's zone of proximal developent (Vygotsky, 1978), as well as build libraries that are appropriate to students' levels.    
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

In order to teach to the student's zone of proximal development, the ENL teacher uses visual scaffolds including glossaries, 
graphic organizers, and images, as well as home language translations when appropriate, to support students during small 
group instruction.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of our ELLs is quantitatively measured by various progress monitoring data, including the Fountas and Pinnell 
System which includes running records that are conducted in the fall and spring to monitor students’ reading levels, the 
Periodic Assessment Exam for ELLs, (also given in the fall and spring) and students’ NYSESLAT scores at the end of the school 
year. The overall goal is to have ELLs attain a proficient score of Commanding on the NYSESLAT and exit ENL the following 
year.  Growth is also measured when ELLs move up a proficiency level, from Entering to Emerging, Emerging to Transitioning, 
and Transitioning to Expanding and Expanding to Commanding.  In addition, success of our ELLs is assessed on a continual 
basis through individual writing portfolios that are kept and reviewed by the ENL teacher throughout the year.    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The ENL teacher and classroom teacher employ a variety of interventions to address specific needs, including individualized 
lessons, as well as differentiated materials and assessments.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Based on NYSESLAT and ELA data the foundation of RtI for ELLs is Tier 1, expanding students’ existing competencies to support 
literacy learning and content knowledge.  Core instruction focuses on language and literacy development especially to support 
reading and writing competencies.  The ENL teacher employs strategies such as building on background knowledge and 
frontloading vocabulary which promotes written language development during the instructional core.  Intensive, targeted 
intervention, Tiers 2 and 3, are informed by progress monitoring data, including the Fountas and Pinnell System to assess early 
literacy skills, the Periodic Assessment Exam for ELLs given in the fall and spring, the NYC Performance Assessment in ELA and 
other assessments designed and administered by the ENL teacher.     
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
NOT APPLICABLE .  Those students receiving ENL services have all reached a Commanding level of proficiency on the 
NYSESLAT.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

 The ENL program at Ballet Tech is a program that includes integrated and stand alone components.  As mandated in 
the New York State CR Part 154.2, Entering ELLs are provided with 360 minutes of instruction every week consisting of 
180 minutes of integrated ENL and 180 minutes of stand-alone ENL.  Emerging ELLs are also provided with 360 
minutes of instruction every week, but with 225 minutes of integrated ENL and 135 minutes of stand-alone 
ENL.  Transitioning ELLs are provided with 180 minutes of instruction divided equally into 90 minutes of integrated 
ENL and 90 minutes of stand-alone ENL.  Expanding ELLs are  provided with 180 minutes per week of integrated ENL 
instruction.  Finally, Commanding ELLs are provided with 90 minutes per week of integrated ENL instruction.  Scholars 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

 

are placed in a group based on their most recent NYSITELL or NYSESLAT scores.  The integrated component allows the 
ENL teacher to push in to one of the content areas and address scholars’ different learning styles by differentiating 
instruction.  Within the Integrated component of ENL,  students are grouped heterogeneously in content-area classes 
and co-taught by an ENL teacher and a content-area teacher.  During these periods English skills are built through 
content-area instruction focusing on the implementation of ENL strategies that enable ELLs to access the core 
curriculum more successfully.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

                   As mandated in the New York State CR Part 154.2, Entering ELLs are provided with 360 minutes of instruction every 
week consisting of 180 minutes of integrated ENL and 180 minutes of stand-alone ENL.  Emerging ELLs are also provided with 
360 minutes of instruction every week, but with 225 minutes of integrated ENL and 135 minutes of stand-alone 
ENL.  Transitioning ELLs are provided with 180 minutes of instruction divided equally into 90 minutes of integrated ENL and 90 
minutes of stand-alone ENL.  Expanding ELLs are  provided with 180 minutes per week of integrated ENL instruction.  Finally, 
Commanding ELLs are provided with 90 minutes per week of integrated ENL instruction.    
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
            In their content areas, ELLs receive instruction in English that is aligned to the New York State and Common Core 
learning standards.  The majority of the content teachers are versed in the effective ESL methodologies and work together 
with the ENL. teacher to make content comprehensible and enrich language development.  Especially within the integrated 
component of ENL, they present a plethora of lessons and activities that encourage communication in the classroom, as well 
as the use of academic vernacular.  Additionally, lessons are modeled, contextualized, and scaffolded to maximize 
learning.  The common instructional practices that content area teachers use with ELLs include but are not limited to: 
  
•     Whole language approach: Language is used in natural ways for a specific purpose in an activity that fosters social 
interactions.  Instruction closely integrates speaking, listening, reading and writing. 
•     Cooperative learning activities:  Scholars work together in small groups on a time limited task.  Scholars negotiate and 
exchange knowledge and experiences while making connections with content and language. 
•     Cognitive Academic Language Learning Approach (CALLA) 
•     Total Physical Response (TPR) 
•     Scaffolding 
•     Visuals 
•     Graphic organizers 
•     Collaborative learning 
•     Modeling 
•     Read alouds 
•     Pair share  
•     Independent reading/writing in journals 
•     Skills and guided practice 
  
             In order to challenge students to use higher order thinking skills, there are many open-ended questioning techniques, 
accountable-talk, and non-fiction reading and writing.  Implementing such practices allows for the development of both basic 
and inter-personal communication skills (BICS) and cognitive academic language proficiency (CALP) in our ELLs. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

  
    
    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

      The Spanish LAB gives initial information about a student’s literacy level in their home language of Spanish.    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a.     Scholars with interrupted formal education (SIFE) and ELLs identified as having special needs receive additional 
instructional time before school, as well as targeted instruction in the afterschool program as identified in their Personal 
Intervention Plans  (PIP).   
b.     Newcomers (ELLs who have been in US schools less than 3 years) receive intensive targeted instruction in the 4 
modalities, reading, writing, speaking and listening, in small group settings.  This targeted instruction insures that ELLs quickly 
achieve the state-designated grade-level of English language proficiency.  
c       ELLs receiving service for 4 to 6 years who are in danger of becoming long term ELLs receive appropriate RtI Tier 1 
intervention and if necessary,  (for those ELLs who are not showing sufficient progress on the skills and/or competencies 
measured), RtI Tier 2, intensive, targeted intervention. 
d.     The goal for Long Term ELLs who have completed 6 or more years of ENL instruction is to attain English language 
proficiency by the end of the school year.  These ELLs have agility with social interactional English while lacking the advanced 
linguistic knowledge and skills required by complex secondary coursework.  Instruction overall is driven by the students’ 
NYSESLAT scores which indicate individual strengths and weaknesses according to the 4 aforementioned modalities.  To 
accomplish this, the ENL teacher uses NYSESLAT test prep curriculum throughout the year to prepare these students for the 
NYSESLAT exam in the spring of 2016. 
e.     When ELLs reach Commanding levels of proficiency on the NYSESLAT, they continue to receive 90 minutes of integrateed 
ENL instruction for up to two years after exiting ELL status. They also receive ENL mandated NYS testing modifications for 
these two additional years. These testing accommodations include time extension, a separate location,  bilingual dictionaries 
and glossaries, simultaneous use of English and alternative language state test editions, oral translation for lower-incidence 
languages, and written responses in the native language. Individual support plans are also created in conjunction with content 
area teachers as needed to assist in ELA, Math and other content areas.    
  
    
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers of ELL-SWDs use a variety of instructional strategies to facilitate access to academic content area and accelerate 
English language development.  Among these strategies are  
       •     Small group instruction 
       •     Modify and adapt grade level text 
       •     RTI tier 1 high quality instruction 
       •     SMART board use of Technology 
       •     Graphic organizers 
       •     Audio visual aids 
       •     Visual aids 
Some of the materials that teachers of ELL-SWDs use includes but is not limited to Mind Institute's "Spatial-Temporal (ST) 
Math" program software, Region13 ELL Instructional Strategies Social Science Sheets and National Geographic Kids magazine. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Ballet Tech does not presently have any ELL-SWDs.  In the case that new ELLs are enrolled who are SWDs, the following 
flexibility is used to ensure that IEP goals and English proficiency are attained:  
       •     Grade level meetings that involve both General Education and Special Education  
       •     Regular collaboration between the ENL teacher and the IEP Team  
       •     Additional instructional time after school in the Roads to Success Program 
       •     Targeted instruction in decoding and reading comprehension skills using the Wilson “Just Words” program 
  
    
    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
  Targeted intervention programs are set up for students, including ELLs, who have received a 1 or a 2 on the NYS ELA and/or 
Math exam.   In order to improve the literacy and academic skills of these students and give them the skills to perform at city 
and state grade level standards, content area teachers incorporate many recognized and researched based ESL instructional 
strategies: 
  
•    Scaffolding is an essential part of the instructional delivery, such as modeling, bridging, schema building, contextualization, 
and metacognition. 
•    Assisting students during work periods, conferring with students in and out of class, informal assessments, and running 
records. 
•    Additional small group instruction occurs in our after school tutorial, incorporating guided reading lessons and word study 
running records 
  
In addition, our teachers consider the language needs of our ELLs by incorporating the following strategies: 
  
•    Content area teachers monitor the understanding of linguistically challenging material and use a variety of phrasings and 
synonyms to clarify meaning. 
•    Content area teachers use a variety of instructional materials to deliver instruction in a workshop model. The balanced 
literacy model provides opportunities to meet the needs of our ELLs within the ELA workshop: Guided, Shared, and 
Independent reading and writing opportunities are offered daily and provide students with the chance to work closely with 
their teacher to achieve high academic standards. 
•    Math teachers devote extra time in class to untangle difficult word problems, and require students to make verbal 
explanations of the problems they work on. 
•    Social Studies teachers scaffold their instruction with visual aids such as maps, atlases, and illustrations to increase 
comprehension.  
   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

At this time Ballet Tech has no new programs or improvements being considered.     
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

At this time, Ballet Tech is not planning to discontinue any programs or services for ELLs. We feel that our current programs 
benefit our students, and will continue to re-evaluate their effectiveness on a year to year basis at the end of each school-year. 
  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building.

Some of the curricular activities that students,  including ELLs, participate in include weekly book clubs, small-group 
intervention reading groups, and advisory. ELLs are also invited to participate in the Roads to Success afterschool program 
which offers enrichment activities such as homework help and arts education.    
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Some of the instructional materials used to support ELLs include, but are not limited to Mind Institute's "Spatial-Temporal (ST) 
Math" program software, Region13 ELL Instructional Strategies Social Science Sheets, National Geographic Kids magazine and

and speaking that is required for ELA, Social Studies and Science.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language support is provided in the ENL program. The ENL teacher sometimes uses Spanish, a dominant language 
among ELLs, to clarify points and students are encouraged to use their home language for specific purposes, such as 
clarification or questioning. ELLs are also provided with materials in their native language when necessary and available and 
have access to bilingual dictionaries and glossaries in stand-alone ENL and integrated ENL as well.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Ballet Tech uses grade-leveled materials that are appropriate to students' grades and ages. In addition, graphic organizers and 
other visual aids that scaffold the writing process are used to support ELLs who need additional support with the writing 
process.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Some of the instructional materials used to support ELLs include, but are not limited to Mind Institute's "Spatial-Temporal (ST) 
Math" program software, Region13 ELL Instructional Strategies Social Science Sheets, National Geographic Kids magazine and  
the English 3D Language Development Program, used with long-term ELLs, to develop academic vocabulary in reading, writing 
and speaking that is required for ELA, Social Studies and Science.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
•     The parent coordinator oversees the incoming 4th graders, including ELLs and their families, who are invited to a new 
school orientation,  Morning Café, in the third week of July.  Materials are presented to each family including a letter from the 
Principal, the Ballet Tech Handbook and a Parent Survey to help learn more about new students and their families. 
•     The ENL teacher conducts a Family Orientation:  English Language Options in the DOE (ongoing from September through 
June) for all guardians/parents of new ELLs  
   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

At Ballet Tech, Spanish is offered as a language elective for all students, including ELLs.    
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Professional development at Ballet Tech is provided by school staff.  Within the school's professional development program, 
the focus includes: 
•     Literacy needs of our ELL population addressed by including differentiated instruction in our planning sessions. 
•     Scaffolding in the content areas. 
•     Creating opportunities for ELLs to use a variety of modalities to learn (listening centers, visual representations, math 
manipulatives, etc). 
In addition, the ENL teacher will attend various professional development workshops offered by the Department of English 
Language Learners and Student Support throughout the year that relate to supporting ELLs as they engage in the Common 
Core Learning Standards.  The ENL teacher will also provide support to all staff in the form of weekly meetings in order to 
present relevant material and strategies for use with ELLs and receive and give feedback regarding individual students and 
their progress throughout the year.  As prescribed by CR Part 80,  attendence sign in sheets, agendas and certificates of 
attendance will be kept on file to monitor the 15% of total hours that all teachers must receive regarding  ELL-specific 
professional development, and the 50% of total hours that the ENL teacher must receive.       
  
Teachers of ELLs will also attend periodic professional development workshops offered by the Department of English Language 
Learners and Student Support that focus on specific strategies and methodologies that facilitate engaging ELLs in the Common 
Core Learning Standards.  They will also attend several professional development sessions facilitated by the ENL teacher, 
among them    
ENL Strategies and Common Core Learning Standards, How to Teach Academic Language to ELLs and ELL-SWDs  and the 
Writing Process. 
  
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The guidance counselor and the ENL teacher will work together to assist ELLs as they transition from elementary to middle and 
middle to high school.  In addition, the guidance counselor will also attend those professional development sessions facilitated 
by the ENL teacher that are pertinent to guiding ELLs through this process.  
As per CR Part 154.2: All teachers of ELLs will attend professional development workshops, ensuring that 15% of the total 
required hours are ELL-specifc topics.  As part of the professional development plan for the ENL teacher,  the ENL teacher will 
also attend periodic professional development workshops, many offered by the Department of English Language Learners and 
Student Support, and attend professional development conferences given by The Division of Family and Community 
Engagement.  As prescribed by CR Part 80,  attendence sign in sheets, agendas and certificates of attendance will be kept on 
file to monitor the 15% of total hours that all teachers must receive regarding ELL-specific professional development, and the 
50% of total hours that the ENL teacher must receive.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
  
  
1. & 2. 
  In addition to mandated parent orientation meetings, the ENL teacher will meet individually with parents/guardians of ELLs 
twice a year, in the fall and spring,  to discuss the goals of the program, their child's language development progress, the 
language proficiency assessment results and any language development needs that are specific to any content area.  These 
meetings will be conducted in the preferred language of the parent/guardian by the ENL teacher or through the interpretation 
services offered through the DOE as per the Language and Interpretation Plan.  Records of these meetings and any phone calls 
as well as copies of letters exchanged with parents/guardians throughout the year will be keep in an ELL Binder of Critical 
Documents kept in a central location.  Parents/guardians are also provided with ENL program materials in their home 
language, which are supplied by the DOE.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
  Throughout the school year, parents attend academic workshops, curriculum overviews, and social events that help create a 
productive learning community. The Multicultural Dinner, Holiday Dance, Evening of the Arts Exhibit,  and Poetry Café, enable 
the school community to come together to recognize student achievements in both the arts and academics.  Translation and 
Interpretation Services are provided to increase the involvement of our parents in all school activities. Funding is available to 
translate important notices and documents for parents who need such services. Additionally, translation services are provided 
during parent / teacher conferences when needed.  The Parent Coordinator  who acts as the Language Access Coordinator  will 
interface with the parent association throughout the year to continuously monitor the translation and interpretation services 
at the school.  The administration will also conduct a survey at the end of each academic school year to gather feedback from 
parents regarding the quality and availability of services.  In addition, the role of the Parent Cordinator includes: 
  *   Increase parent involvement in the school by working closely with school, parent, and community organizations. 
  *   Serve as facilitator for parent and school community concerns and issues including, for example, school policies or facilities 
issues. 
  *   Conduct outreach to engage parents in their children’s education. 
  *   Convene regular parent meetings and events around topics of key interest to parents. 
  *   Attend parent meetings. 
  *   Work with the school parent association when asked to provide assistance in establishing by-laws and conducting their 
affairs in accordance with Chancellor’s Regulation A-660. 
  *   Serve as a school liaison to central OFIA and its staff. 
  *   Maintain ongoing contact with community organizations that are involved with providing services to support the school’s 
educational program. 
  *   Organize open school night and other events to increase parental and community involvement, and create a welcoming 
school environment to parents.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Roy Oneill, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Students provide blue Emergency Contact Cards upon initial enrollment in school which indicate the language 
preference of their parents/guardians and additionally, through the ATS RAPL and RHLA reports, the adult 
prefered languages that are written and spoken at home are generated. Each year our parent coordinator also 
asks for any additional requests for translation services. If we have students who are new to the NYC DOE, we 
have the parents/guardians fill out the Home Language Identification Survey at the time of registration.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

provision of translated documents 

 

to parents.  

 

The primary documents that the 
school disseminates within 14 days of 
the start of the academic school year 
(approximately Sept. 17 th ) which 
require translation are the Parent 
Handbook, the Parent Survey and the 
Welcome Kit for new students and 
their families. Throughout the year 
after-school program information is 
translated and periodically sent to 
parents as are any health notices that 
are issued by the New York City Board 
of Education. Translation requests to 
the Translation and Interpretation Unit 
are submitted at least two weeks 
earlier.  

   

 

2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as 

parent-teacher  
conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.
