Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our school community is founded upon the pillars of academic achievement, community, service, and individual 
growth through empowerment. Our school mission is to provide students with a rigorous and intensive curriculum in 
science and mathematics. This background, coupled with a broad base of liberal arts, will enable our students to 
attain access for admission to selective 4 year post secondary institutions.

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics (MCSM) serves 1607 students, of which 49.84% are male and 50.16% 
are female. Ethnically, MCSM students are represented as follows: Hispanic 53.95%, Black/African America 19.29%, 
Asian 19.92%, White 4.98%, and Other 2.06%, and Not Reported 1.80%. Our English Language Learner (ENL) student 
body comprises 6.66 %; while Students with Disabilities (SWD) constitute 11.76% of the school populace. Within the 
school 85.37 % of students are eligible for free or reduced lunch (Title 1). Manhattan Center for Science and 
Mathematics celebrates a four–year graduation rate sustaining 90% or greater for the past seven years. The current 
graduation rate is 96.0%, with a ten -year average college acceptance rate of 98%. 

Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics for the second year has been designated as a NYS Rewards School for 
our success in closing all subgroup achievement gaps. The student populations upon which we have historically 
focused are the SWD and ENL students because these students face the greatest challenges in achievement as 
measured through credit accrual and passing required exams, which has its greatest impact as evidenced in the 
graduation rate and college acceptance rate. 

Rigorous instruction is evidenced by the academic achievement of our students as noted in the school mission, 
graduation rates, and college acceptance rates. Moreover, our students are accepted by the nation’s competitive 
universities. The number of students accruing more than ten credits per year is consistently greater than ninety 
percent. More than fifty percent of MCSM student are enrolled in Advanced Placement courses. This academic year 
our CEP goal to raise our average SAT score was successfully achieved. All grade 11 students were given a 20 week 
SAT prep course designed by MCSM teachers. The April city-wide administration of the SAT exam results brought the 
average SAT score up to 1195. Our continuing special initiative in grade 9 English provides every student with a year-
long writing intensive course in which class sizes do not exceed twenty students. Every student in MCSM participates 
in a school wide Independent Reading program in which all students and staff read silently for fifty minutes per week. 
The Advanced Science Research (ASR) program, in coordination with SUNY Albany, provides students with authentic 
scientific research over a three year program, in which students work with college professors as mentors conducting 
their own research.  

Strong Family and Community ties are well documented in providing our students with external supports from CBOs 
and affiliated organizations. Our Parents Association provides many supports for families in the areas of College and 
Career Readiness. School faculty annually collaborates with the Parents Association providing workshops in academic 
achievement, the college application process, and financial aid application processes. School-Family communications 
have played a vital role in building trust among parents, students, and teachers contributing to the continuous 
improvement in school-wide student achievement. Teachers and counselors maintain a thorough communications 
digital documentation system, as parents communicate with teachers through this system. Students view this 
communication through the data system used for grades.  

MCSM provides a strong supportive environment for students and their families though our student service 
initiatives, which are categorized into Special Academic Programs, Partnerships, In-School Services, Clubs, and 
Enrichment affiliations. Special Academic programs include those programs which may offer credit through in school 
programs such as ASR, or through partnering CBOs such as Columbia University Double Discovery, Upward Bound 
with John Jay College and St. Johns College, or College Now courses taken at CUNY – Hunter, Lehman, or City College. 
We maintain partnerships with CBOs servicing our students. The following organizations recruit from our student 
body annually: Icahn School of Medicine CEYE, Columbia DDC, SEO Scholars, NBC Scholars, Children’s Aid Society 
Hope Leadership, and Teen Harbor. These programs provide SAT tutoring, academic programs, as well as college 
guidance. In School Services also include SAPIS, RAPP, and the Mount Sinai Medical Center which provide additional 
supports in the social-emotional and medical needs of students. MCSM boasts greater than thirty clubs for students 
which are provided by faculty on a voluntary basis. External affiliations are provided to students through their 
guidance counselors. MCSM provides over forty programs to which students may apply for summer or weekend 
enrichment. For two consecutive years, through administrative and teacher collaboration, an advisory program was 
designed and implemented for every student. Each staff member was assigned 20 students, with whom they met a

minimum of four times during the year mandated. Teachers and administrators collaborated to design a graduation 
and college readiness checklist for teachers to review with each student in their group.  

Teacher Collaboration is evidenced by their voluntary participation in a multitude clubs and organizations. Moreover, 
teachers participate in open cabinet meetings determining school procedures and policy. Teacher led initiatives have 
developed the school’s professional development systems and program through the PD committee. Every Monday is 
dedicated to professional development, in which teachers share effective practices through teacher designed 
workshops. Teachers maintain reflections logs which are submitted to department supervisors. The Bilingual Teacher 
team meets monthly to address student needs, instruction, support services, and parent engagement. Teachers and 
administrators also collaborate at the departmental level analyzing student achievement and academic data to inform 
instruction in curricular design, unit planning, and lesson planning. Students regularly view their grades, which has 
also contributed to improved performance. Teacher ownership of school policy and initiatives is evidenced by the 
creation of the many programs detailed herein through the regular process of open cabinet meetings to which all 
faculty are invited, and encouraged to participate in the development and implementation of school policies and 
practices.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our English Language Learner (ENL) student body comprises 6.66 %; while Students With Disabilities (SWD) constitute 
11.76 % of the school populace. Within the school 85.37 % of students are eligible for free-reduced lunch (Title 1). ENL 
and SWD students are provided with additional academic supports through tutoring and mock exams. Specific need 
for both populations include exam preparation and tutoring.  

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

During the 2016-2017 academic year Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics made significant gains in the 
following domains: 

Rigorous Instruction. Our 2017-2018 CEP goal for rigorous instruction was to raise the school average SAT scores by 
50 points to 1185. The school average score the the city-wide April SAT administration was 1195. In the domain for 
Supportive Environment for all grade 11 students taking the SAT prep course 97% passed the course, exceeding the 
goal by 4%. Course participation is evidenced by the high attendance rate and student grades. Collaborative Teachers 
showed improvements whereby the twenty-week SAT prep course curriculum was designed by the teachers using 
student data to drive instruction. Effective School Leadership has had significant significant gains this year in the 
School Quality Review. This year in our quality review MCSM earned a perfect score of Well Developed in every 
domain. Our CEP goal for this domain was achieved in which 100% of our teachers received professional development 
which improved family engagement through consistent grade input into grade-book systems, while increasing family 
outreach and communication. Within the Strong Family Ties domain, the goal was for 100% of all teachers to 
document phone conferences for students who showed more than a five or more point drop in their overall class 
average. The success of this data is supported by term one grades in which all departmental course passing rates were 
higher than 92%.  

During our SLT meetings this year we spent much time reviewing the efficacy of our previous initiatives which tended 
to be comprehensively focused by integrating the six elements for framework of great schools. Each department 
presented its statistics, practices, areas of celebration and goals. Our team has determined that this year we will focus 
on each element of the framework discretely to better meet our students expanding needs. Generally, the areas we 
seeking to improve are within the instructional domain. An increased registration for robotics classes this year verifies 
a growing student interest in hands-on pre-engineering courses. When reviewing our regents results for Mathematics 
the school leadership team has determined that an area of focus will be improving the Geometry Regents results. 
While grade 9 student performance has improved through our initiatives of Freshman Orientation and the grade 9 
writing course, when reviewing the failure reports from term one and projected summer school registers the school

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
There has been a growing demand from students for hands-on learning, pre-engineering based programs. The register 
for the Robotics class in 2016-17 was limited to one section comprised of eleven students. This year due to demand 
the school created five sections of robotics which sustained a total register of 144 students. This growing demand led 
the team survey for interest in an aerospace pre-engineering program with an introduction to flight course. Survey 
results indicated that there are at least 75 students with interest in this subject area.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 100 students will be actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking 
skills through the successful implementation of an aerospace pre-engineering course for introduction to flight as 
measured by a passing rate of 93% or greater.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Freshman Orientation and the grade 9 writing course supports have greatly improved grade 9 student performance. 
When reviewing students in need of credit recovery for grade nine by examining the ATS summer school pre-
registration reports it was determined that 6.9% general education students, in comparison to 27.8% of special 
education students required credit recovery for the summer. We seek to provide greater support for special 
education students to them transition from middle to high school by supplementing the bridge and writing programs 
with a freshman seminar that builds English and Math foundations while establishing study skills.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, establishing a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by 
their teachers and peers 20% or fewer special education students will require summer school credit recovery after 
completing freshman seminar as measured by passing rates from June 2019 scholarship data.

96.99% and 99.47% respectively; when compared to the same years for Regents: 76.58% and 79.41 % respectively 
that there was lower reliability of course grades in relation to Geometry Regents exam scores. Conversely, when team 
examined Algebra 2 course grades in relation to Regents scores for 2015-16 and 2016-2017 there was a greater 
reliability where by course passing rates were respectively, 93.52% and 95.42% in relation to the respective Regents 
passing rates of 91.21% and 93.67%. The current math course sequence has been as follows: Algebra 1, Geometry, 
then Algebra 2/Pre-Calculus. The SLT in collaboration with math teachers and administration have determined that 
the a change in math course sequencing would benefit student Regents performance rates whereby students will 
move from Algebra 1 directly to Algebra 2/Pre-Calculus, then Geometry. Accordingly, teachers will collaborate to 
write a new curriculum for Geometry.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

96.99% and 99.47% respectively; when compared to the same years for Regents: 76.58% and 79.41 % respectively 
that there was lower reliability of course grades in relation to Geometry Regents exam scores. Conversely, when team 
examined Algebra 2 course grades in relation to Regents scores for 2015-16 and 2016-2017 there was a greater 
reliability where by course passing rates were respectively, 93.52% and 95.42% in relation to the respective Regents 
passing rates of 91.21% and 93.67%. The current math course sequence has been as follows: Algebra 1, Geometry, 
then Algebra 2/Pre-Calculus. The SLT in collaboration with math teachers and administration have determined that 
the a change in math course sequencing would benefit student Regents performance rates whereby students will 
move from Algebra 1 directly to Algebra 2/Pre-Calculus, then Geometry. Accordingly, teachers will collaborate to 
write a new curriculum for Geometry. Administration will ensure that teachers are provided with professional 
development, common planning time, and the data required to write a new Geometry curriculum.

Our school survey element scores for Strong Family-Community Ties score for 2016-2017 was .12 lower than our 
score for 2015-2016, with 89% of parent responding. The SLT examined the school survey and identified that section 
for Parent Involvement in School was the primary reason for this change in the overall score. Particularly parent 
responses to th e question about the number of opportunities to volunteer at school indicated that this is a school 
need to be addressed.

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Professional development is data driven and teachers form and integral part of the professional development 
committee. Teachers are provided in-house and off-campus professional development as their needs dictate. 

Mentors are assigned to support struggling and un-qualified teachers. Administrative staff will recruit excessed staff 
from schools through the Borough Field Support Center (BFSC) and attend hiring fairs to identify and recruit highly 
qualified teachers. Staffing assignments are determined student needs in programming aligned to teacher 
preferences sheets as determined by the department supervisor. Staff retention is accomplished by providing 
teachers with supportive pedagogical environment in which teachers are empowered as stakeholders in their 
professional growth and performance.  

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Teachers attend national, state and local CCSS conferences. Department inquiry teams continually align the 
curriculum to CCSS as student performance and anecdotal data suggests. Curricular revisions with CCSS are 
periodically adjusted to reflect student needs identified through weekly inquiry team and teacher driven and designed 
professional development. Teachers are continually observed using Danielson to provide them with feedback and 
help them with reflect on their practice. The staff and administration will continue to attend in Borough Field Support 
Center (BFSC)  and district CCSS workshops. Teachers design and implement their own weekly professional 
development. School support staff are provided with training to support through departmental meetings to ensure 
students meet common Core standards.

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
All teachers participate in departmental meetings in which student assessments are determined. All teachers during 
department meeting decide on the assessment and professional development alignments. A interdisciplinary 
representative school wide professional development committee meets to determine school wide professional 
development needs, establish professional development programs which convene weekly. All teachers are invited to 
attend weekly cabinet meetings. All teachers are engaged in inquiry team work which analyzes student assessment 
data, including: Regents Item Analysis, departmental uniform exams and projects which are used to drive curricular 
revisions and guide professional development which informs instruction. Teacher teams also disaggregate the data 
based on student ethnicity, language proficiency, socio-economic status, and other at-risk factors. Our school will 
continue to offer workshops during Chancellor Professional Development days on best practices for understanding 
and utilizing student assessment data. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not

available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics , in compliance with the 
Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)), is responsible for creating and implementing 
a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school 
and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and 
decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the 
School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed 
members of the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics actively involves and engages parents in the planning, review, and 
evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I program, as well as the joint development of the School 
Comprehensive Educational Plan, Title I Parent Involvement Policy, and School-Parent Compactactively by holding 
annual elections to establish the Title 1 Committee, electing parent representatives for the SLT who are responsible 
for the writing and evaluation of the CEP's efficacy. Parents are encouraged to attend monthly PA meetings where 
they are reimbursed for travel and provided with dinner, translation and babysitting services all in an effort to 
increase parent participation and share decision making in guiding the parent involvement in the writing of the CEP 
and coordination of Title I activities.  

 

Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

  Working with CBOs such as Bridge Up/NYPLand NextGenVest to provide parents information on financial aid 

and after-school study programs; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

  providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, 

e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress;

Survey school wide annually. Once a student is verified as being in temporary housing the needs 
determination is made to provide students with a care package from the school which includes: personal 
toiletries, clothing, school supplies and a back pack.  

  Ensuring parents have digital access to their children's grades, attendance, report cards, and transcripts.  
  Al parents of grade 11 students will be required to participate in review their children's SAT baseline data 

report and target scores as provided by the teachers. Parents will be required to sign and return a contract 
acknowledging their child's progress. 

  As indicated in the School -Parent Compact, part II, parents agree to ensure that their children are completing 

assignments at home fro school related to the SAT course.  

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;

Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: understanding educational accountability, grade-level 
curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and technology 
training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g. ESSA/State accountability 
system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Quality Snapshot, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before October 30th of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions;

3. 
4. 
High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 
the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”

Parents of the ELL students are currently afforded the same parental involvement opportunities 
as our non ELL parents. They are contacted regularly and included in all Parent Association 
functions. Translation headsets are provided for the meetings that are held in English. We will 
continue to hold two major meetings per year, one in the fall and the other during the spring 
semester.  In addition we will provide parents with technology workshops in order to introduce 
them to Skedula/ Pupilpath and our school website. The meetings and workshops will be 
conducted by the bilingual coordinator and the bilingual team. The school will send out letters- 
in their appropriate language - offering other workshops or information schools calendars, 
events, important test dates, exam preparation, after-school activities, cultural events, college 
readiness, adult education opportunities , family health care, immigration issues and other 
significant topics. The school's parent coordinator, Zaida Santiago will work with the new 
bilingual coordinator to plan for future events that will benefit all our parents. The school is 
currently in a partnership with City College LAESA ro inform parents of their child's future 
college admissions and careers. 
This year our 9th grade counselor created a manual for all students with information about 
college choices, requirements and scholarships . He and the rest of the guidance team presented 
all of this during school in their English class to guarantee that all students received the 
information and understood the content. We plan to do this again in the 2018-2019 school year. 
Parents are also invited to our open house hours on Tuesdays from 2:45 P.M to 4:00 PM to visit 
their child's teacher. In addition, they can also make an appointment to see the bilingual 
coordinator any day of the week during 0 or 9th period. they can email her at 
cmontalvo6@schools.nyc.gov or call her at 212-876-4639.  Parents can also can access our 
school's website which provides them with update information of all the activities we have in 
school . Also they have access to pupilpath.com which provides them with their child's 
performance in class on a by weekly basis and their current teachers' information.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
MCSM uses diagnostic exams in ELA, Math, and Spanish to assess where students are when they enter in their 9th Grade year, 
and Every September to see what was lost over the summer for grades 10-12. We use the results of these diagnostics 
with NYSESLAT results, and this is the initial data that we use to drive instruction in the subjects specific to the TBE program, 
Math, Science, and Social Studies.  When students come to the school brand new from a different country we use the 
NYSITELL exam to place a student.We also use the database from Skedula/Pupilpath, like 8th-grade performances to plan for 
instruction.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

ENL teachers meet with the content teachers in team meetings to discuss strategies and action plans to help ENL students 
meet state level standards for college readiness. We meet monthly on Wednesdays from 7:00-8:15 a.m. In those meetings we 
draft response to intervention plans for specific management/social emotional/academic targets for our at-risk ENL students 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

 

who are not on track for receiving credit in their courses. The team then distributes the action plan to their grade level teams 
so students who are enrolled in courses that the ENL team members do not teach, have a plan to address the skills and plan 
for the specific student who is struggling. Department teams meet Mondays after school from 2:45-4:00 p.m. We share our 
ENL team minutes and plans with our grade level teams via one-drive. The expectation for the 2018-2019 school year is that 
11th and 12th grade math and science update their unit plans to reflect the action steps recommended by the ENL team.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
At MCSM we use NYC Performance Tasks in 9th and 10th grade ELA to determine growth of our ENL students for English. In 
9/10 grade we use the Regents for Living Environment, Algebra I, Earth Science, and Algebra II to determine growth from their 
9th grade baseline. For the 2019 school year we will be using the results of the LOTE in the students home language to 
determine growth in their native speaking language classes.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

We work with to parents to ensure student's success. Progress reports are sent home in the middle of every marking period. 
Struggling students are offered extra sessions before and after school and during Saturday Academy, If a student is struggling a 
meeting is set up with the parent, guidance counselor, bilingual coordinator and student. we then create a plan for the student 
and parent to help them achieve their full potential. Students are provided with accounts for castlelearning.com to support 
their self-study habits as discussed and taught in their classes, and Freshman Seminar. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
At MCSM we use NYC Performance Tasks in 9th and 10th grade ELA to determine growth of our ENL students for English and 
their writing with evidence skills. In 9/10 grade we use the Regents for Living Environment, Algebra I, Earth Science, and 
Algebra II to determine growth from their 9th grade baseline. For the 2019 school year we will be using the results of the LOTE 
in the students home language to determine growth in their native speaking language classes. For grades 11/12 we use 
Regents Chemistry/Physics and AP Calculus exam results to determine growth in mathematics.  We also take a look at the 
credit accumulation and Regents performances to determine the success of our programs.  This allows us to drive instruction, 
create extra support sessions before and after school and acquire software and new technology that will help with student's 
weakness.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

In inquiry team meetings, teachers meet to discuss and continuously improve their effectiveness in their planning and delivery 
for differentiated instruction for the different populations of students they have in their classroom. Monthly team members 
review and reflect on current student standings in their courses. The ENL team is divided into two groups; Team 9/10 and 
Team 11/12. These teams are divided as such because they loop with the students for two years. 
We have a Bilingual team made of ELL, Native language arts, and content area teachers. All information pertaining these 
students is shared during the meetings and it also is posted in our group online, we use OneDrive and Pupilpath to share 
student's progress and action steps with students.  
We share in our actions with the guidance team, and update them as needed to support our ENL population. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

There are currently 155 ENL students in our school.  94 students are in our TBE Program, and 61 students are in our 
Freestanding ENL program.  
ENL students are programmed according to their level as indicated on their NYSESLAT or NYSITELL exam. Free 
standing services are utilized at MCSM for ENL students in the TBE program and students who are not. 61 students 
are provided instruction in extended day periods, as not to disrupt their daily program and allow them to take 
electives and graduation requirements, including our mandated SAT prep course. They are served by licensed ENL 
teachers, in our freestanding courses. 
In total, we have 6 ENL sections across grades 9 thru 12.  They are labeled as follows: ESS1/2, ESS3/4, ESS5/6,  and 
ESS7/8. for the ENTERING students and those with IEPs. Some of our ENL classes are taught by English teachers along 
with a push-in ESL teacher.   
An ELL student who enters Manhattan Center opting for a Freestanding ENL Program will be placed according to their 
NYSESLAT Score. The Special Education ELLs are placed in our Freestanding ESL classes.  Because of their disabilities, 
some receive Speech Therapy, Related Services, Counseling or Resource Room, and we accommodate their needs in 
both English Language Learning and Special needs. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

MCSM offers a full ninth and tenth-grade Transitional Bilingual Spanish Program (TBE).  The ninth grade Transitional 
Bilingual Spanish Program consists of a Bilingual Earth Science (SES21QPS), Bilingual Global History (HGS41QPS), and a 
Bilingual Algebra I(MES21QPS).  The tenth grade includes Bilingual Living Environment (SLS21QPS), Bilingual Global II 
(HGS43QPS), and Bilingual Algebra II (MRS21QPS).  The students following this program also receive one period of 
NLA services a day (215 min. a week) as well as ENL/English courses depending on their NYSESLAT scores.  A student 
in the ninth grade Transitional Program who scores in the ENTERING level will receive two units of ENL a day plus 
bilingual classes or 645 min. a week.  The  EMERGING and TRANSITIONING levels will receive 2 units of ENL a day plus 
bilingual classes or 430 min. a week. The EXPANDING students will receive 1 unit of ENL a day plus bilingual classes 
(215 min. a week) and 1 period of English instruction a day (215 min. a week).  Once these students move to the 11th 
grade they will follow the same pattern.  Additionally, they continue to receive ENL services according to their 
NYSESLAT scores and they continue to receive NLA.  By the 11th grade, all our ELL students have transitioned to a 
Freestanding ENL Program.  In the 12th grade, we usually have less than 10 students in our ENL program.  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A  

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Manhattan Center’s goal is for every one of our students to be well-rounded and achieve higher education.  As a result of this, 
we focus on their academic progress and monitor their success.  Our bilingual and ELL students take rigorous content area 
courses which end with a Regents test in which our teachers prepare them well, and this shows in our statistics.  The Language 
Allocation Policy is followed throughout the content areas, for example, for the 9th grades we follow the policy of 60:40 and as 
the grades increase it becomes less Spanish and more English until they are mainstreamed. Our ENL program is enforced until 
the students pass the NYSESLAT.  We actually serve the students with additional minutes since our class periods are over 40 
minutes . 
Our programmer, APs and bilingual coordinator make sure that all students receive the adequate amount units of study 
according to their NYSESLAT test scores as mandated per CR Part 154-2 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Content teachers use a 60:40 approach when teaching ELL students.  However, within a classroom, the lessons are adjusted to 
meet student's individual needs.  In order to help ELL students meet the new Common Core Standards, content teachers are 
focusing on techniques that support the language and what they are teaching in their content areas.  For example, in the social 
studies classes the teacher is introducing primary and secondary sources to enhance the language, and provide Regents based 
instruction.  In science, the teacher is using ENL strategies suggested by Virginia Rojas to enhance the student's literacy 
skills.  In English, the curriculum has been modified to implement the CCLS.  In Spanish, the NYC DOE has provided our teachers 
with advanced content curriculum that has the CCLS incorporated.  In math, our department has been implementing the math 
and literacy CCLS for quite some time.  In essence, literacy is one of the main instructional foci of our school.  For the ELLs it is 
enhanced even more.  Our ELLs also receive many services and accommodations to foster language development.    
Interdisciplinary meetings occur by grade level to ensure all teachers reinforce content as well as ELL goals.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

In the TBE program, students receive a native language class and are constantly evaluated by the teachers. A variety of 
assessment is provided to ensure that students show their full potential. Native Language Classes are offered in three 
levels.  During the junior and senior year, our ELL students can take Ap language or AP Spanish Literature.  
Regents are always offered to all ELL learners in their native language for Living Environment, Earth Science, Algebra I, Global 
History and United States History. Additionally class exams  are given in the native language of the student in 9-10th grade to 
support their learning and preparation for the end of year Regents Exams. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 
The SIFE students are offered extra assistance.  They are provided with review books, tutoring and becoming part of a Bilingual 
Tutoring Center during and after school. Seniors are assigned to them as a peer tutor. They help them with H.W and also guide 
them to ensure that they will not drop out and are successful.  Additionally, our school offers small writing classes where the 
main goal is to increase literacy among students.  
The newcomers, 4 to 6 years and Long-Term ELL students receive different modes of intervention throughout the day.  Their 
teachers use differentiated instruction and strategies that help them learn. ELL teachers once a month to talk about students 
progress and their struggles. Using the data gathered, teachers create lesson/ units to help reinforce the weak areas. For 
example, when kids do not understand a concept in history or science the NLA teacher covers the topic as well. The teacher 
will use art, music, visuals, etc. to create an action plan that allows them to close the achievement gap.  
The Developing ELL students receive different modes of intervention throughout the day.  Their teachers use differentiated 
instruction and strategies that help with instruction and ELL learning.  We have implemented several software programs that 
are now identifying the levels of content mastery for individual students and teachers are now able to differentiate based on 
this data.  All the teachers are part of an inquiry team  ( bilingual team) that analyzes the ELL data pertaining to years of 
service, NYSESLAT levels and Modality Levels and they use this data to drive instruction.. 
The Long-Term ELL students receive different modes of intervention throughout the day.  Their teachers use differentiated 
instruction and strategies that help with instruction and ELL learning.  We have implemented several software programs that 
are now identifying the levels of literacy, content mastery, and social skills for individual students and teachers are now able to 
differentiate based on this data.  All the teachers are part of an inquiry team that analyzes the ELL data pertaining to years of 
service, NYSESLAT levels and Modality Levels and they use this data to drive instruction.  They also use this data to create 
formative assessments and action plans that allow them to close the achievement gap. 
The Former ELL students receive different modes of intervention throughout the day although they are at the COMMANDING 
level.  Teachers continue to provide services to these students.  Some remain part of the Bilingual Cohorts.  They also have 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

continued access to the software programs that are identify the levels of literacy for individual students.  The students 
continue to be monitored by the Bilingual Coordinator.  They also receive mandated services up to two years after exiting ELL 
status, as per CR Part 152.2.   Teacher is expected to know all of their students.  They analyze through Skedula database, 
especially if they have former ELLs in their classes.  They inquire with the Bilingual Coordinator and the supervisors about 
accommodations.  They also meet in inquiry teams through their departments to differentiate instruction for former ELLs. 
 
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Special Education students are provided with extra help that is innovative and engaging in small group settings.  They are 
guided by the ESL, ELA and NLA teachers to use specific ESL strategies.  Some strategies that are implemented are sentence 
starters, read-aloud, leveled questions, writing workshop, and guided reading.   
Teachers try to connect their content  to real life scenarios so students can retain information.  The read-alouds are used to 
practice prediction, discussion, and understanding.  The leveled questions strategy allows students to respond verbally or non 
verbally with understanding and confidence.  The writing workshop allows students to choose their own writing topics and 
work together with others while going through the stages of writing.  The guided reading strategy allows individual coaching, 
and the teachers use the core subject books to address the vocabulary that is unfamiliar to the students.   
Our school is equipped with lot of technology such as smart boards, iPads, computers, clickers, etc, teachers use this to 
guarantee that students are engage and acquire information using multiple points on entry.  
Audio enhancement is also used in the classroom to make sure students understand directions clearly. According to research, 
this audio enhancement in the classroom has show to improve literacy by 15% within the first year of usage.  
We have implemented an independent reading program. This program was designed to help students increase their love for 
reading and as a result to acquire reading stamina, vocabulary and write better. Students  are allowed to choose a book or 
article that they wanted to read and read it during assigned reading times, Mondays and Tuesdays. They write reflections on 
what they read in their journals. This program allows students to read in English or their native language.  
 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
We have classes specifically designed for ELLs-SWDs. These students are in CTT classes.  These classes have a  content and 
special Education teacher with bilingual extension  that will help students acquire information using several teaching 
strategists. In these classes, students are mixed with the general education population so they can learn in a least 
restrictive environment. Both teachers in the class know about their IEP goals and their accommodation.  
 
Also, at the start of the school year, the IEP coordinator teachers the staff about how to see student's IEPs and she is always 
willing to help if you have any questions about it and how to properly provide them with their accommodation.  
 
Since our school is data driven, all lessons are differentiated in order to accommodate all types of learners in our classroom.  
   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
In the TBE and ENL programs, student data is analyzed and used to drive instruction.  For grades 11 through 12 where we do 
not have a TBE and for the other classes, teachers are given the data but how they use that data to drive instruction is 
discussed within departments throughout the school.  
Our TBE and ENL programs allow the teachers to have common planning and meeting times for the data inquiry of these 
results, and each department further analyzes data during  team meetings.  When we analyzed regents results for last year's 
ELLs (this includes ELLs in our TBE, freestanding ESL, and Special Education programs): The class passing rates plus the Regents 
Results allow us to evaluate the success of our programs, but we just need to change and expand our programs so that all of 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

our ELLs can succeed even more beyond the 9th grade.  One great thing that we have accomplished, is that over 50% of our 
bilingual students are graduating with Advanced Regents diplomas.    
 
Former bilingual students serve as tutors in our after school peer-tutoring program and during lunch periods. With the 
direction and help of the bilingual content area teachers, these former bilingual students help address the needs of the current 
bilingual students.  This instruction is given in both English and Spanish. Furthermore, the teachers conduct after school 
tutoring sessions where they focus on their weaknesses and give individual attention to those bilingual students who need 
it.  The students who are in the Freestanding ESL classes also have many opportunities to receive assistance in their areas of 
need, especially with tutoring being available to all.  The bilingual coordinator follows the students’ progress, checking 
progress reports at the middle of every marking period, asking teachers in the bilingual team and content teachers. Their 
progress is also shared with parents and communication with them is the key to their success.    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

For next school year we have decided to integrate our Heritage Spanish Classes with the Native language class. This will help 
our ELL students better integrate with our general Ed population and feel like they are part of the MCSM community.  
we would like to establish a mentoring program with former ELL students and National Honor Society students. This would 
happen after school and during lunch time.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We have a bilingual program. However, our ELL classes are co taught by an ELL and an English teacher.  We only offer one 
STAND-ALONE ENL class during Zero period.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
We offer enhancement sessions after school. Our teachers help students to be successful by tutoring them or giving them 
extra assignments so they can accomplish mastery. These sessions are Wed- Friday after school.  
We also  have a lot of clubs that offer students enrichment and community service opportunities. Students are not restricted 
to attend to any, therefore they can [ick what they think may be better for them.  
 
We have an SAT program that mains to help Juniors  with their scores. Math and English sessions meet twice a week and offer 
mock tests after the course has been taught.  
 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All the ELLs are provided with glossaries in the content areas.  All the ELL classes have a set of dictionaries, and if any other 
teacher in the building wants dictionaries for their ELLs, it will be provided.  We have purchased many books in Spanish to 
increase literacy in their native language.  We have also purchased the software Eduware which allows Regents assessments to 
be printed in English and Spanish.  We have this software in Living Environment, Earth Science and Global History.   
Audio enhancement was brought to the school to ensure students clearly understand their teachers. This will also help 
students with enunciation  as they can imitate better their teachers pronunciation.  
The freshman and sophomore cohort also use Ipads to provide them easy access to translation, use listening features to 
imitate how to pronounce new concepts and words.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

TBE: 60:40 / Materials such as textbooks, worksheets, and assessments are given in Spanish & English. 
ESL: 100 / Materials such as textbooks, books, worksheets, and assessments are given in English only but with differentiation in 
mind.   
We also have adopted the program of Eduware Wizard that allows teachers to provide students with Regents based questions 
in the Spanish and English languages.    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

All cohorts stay in grade levels although the NYSESLAT levels differ.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our school does not share the building with another high school. However, there is a middle school in the building. however, 
the principal of the schools always keep each other in the loop as we get a significant amount of students from there.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
In November our Admissions Committee meets to decipher the data of the students that have chosen MCSM as #1.  We 
monitor closely the ELL students and continue to analyze the data.  We look at criteria such as attendance, math exam scores, 
science exam scores, English exam scores,  grades, NYSESLAT levels, and much more.  Sometimes we call 8th grade guidance 
counselors for recommendations. New for 2018-2019, we held an open house specifically for students who applied to our 
TBE program on their HS application. We met with the parents and students and explained their options and described our 
Program. Once accepted, we conducted an orientation specifically for our ENL parents.  The Bilingual Coordinators and the AP 
split up the ELL Cohort into three classrooms and explains the TBE and ESL programs to both students and parents. The team 
speaks Spanish, and if necessary she will conduct the orientation in Spanish as well.  For other parents, that speak other 
languages, we use the students from the National Honor Society volunteer as translators.  
 
During the summer time we have a bridge program  that focuses on English and Mathematics skills. All ENL students are 
invited to this program, and 87 percent of them attended for the summer of 2018. 
 
In the summer when enrollment is finalized for our ENL and TBE populations, we immediately use the NYSESLAT data, and 
native language, to determine their placement into either TBE or ESL programs.  During the first few weeks of school program 
changes continue to take place until all ELL compliance is met.  If a new ELL enrolls, within 10 days we try to do the HLIS, 
NYSITELL, and programming.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish and French 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 
 
 
 Our school’s professional learning plan has been generated based on several factors, first alignment to the DOE initiatives, 
second data to drive instruction and goals, and finally to maintain a high performing school.  Our teachers receive school-wide,

department, teacher team and individual (choice-driven) PD.  Teachers are expected to turn-key, share best practices and 
reflections.  Teacher teams are designed by departments and discipline. On Monday's from 2:45-4:00 PM, teacher teams meet 
according to department and discuss data, teacher practice, differentiation skills, and lesson/unit plans for their classes. In 
these meetings teachers are instructed to create a goal, a theory of action, provide a short summary of the data and research 
they chose to support their theory of action, and provide minutes for the weekly meetings with accountable products. New for 
the 2019 school year, teachers will present their findings from inquiry team in a mini symposium on chancellors day. Also, 
teachers share office space which allows them to work more closely together and share more often.  In addition, we have 
teacher team working in an interdisciplinary way, our Bilingual Team and the Special Education Team.   
The Bilingual Team is also encouraged to attend the Parent Workshops and School-wide events. Dates may vary, however the 
PA meeting are on the first Tuesday of the month from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM. 
We allow our teachers to select and leave the building for outside Professional Development. The past year we have provided 
PD presented by the collegeboard, NYSABE, and the New York City Department of Education. The following examples of the 
upcoming PDs and organizations that offer ELL professional development.  
 
 
 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 
Our bilingual team members attend to ELL oriented workshops. Each team member then takes the information that they 
learned and shares it with their whole department so all staff is update with all information pertaining to the ELL population.  
We aim to prepare all our teachers to deliver the best and most appropriate level of instruction to our ELL population.  To that 
end,  we have established the following goals: 
-           To provide professional development in methods for quality instruction that includes workshops in scaffolding and 
diversified methods of instruction.  
-           To provide opportunities to write Grade-Level curriculum and assessments that are aligned with NY State standards in 
ELA, NLA, ESL, math, science, social studies and technology, and are provided in both English and the native language as the 
program designates. 
The following professional development opportunities are in place in our school:  
•           The ELL team meets once a month to discuss workshops, student progress, and brainstorm ideas for the ELLs. 
•          We go to NYSABE every year and would like to attend to SABE next year.  
•           Content teachers are sent to vigorous workshops and form study-groups to better serve the ELL population at NYU and 
Fordham University 
•           Common prep time is provided for ELL grade team teachers. 
•           One of two days of staff development during opening of school is devoted to differentiated instruction for ELL 
students.  This is followed-up with two staff/professional development sessions for all teachers during the year. 
•           Coaching for all teachers in differentiated instruction is implemented throughout the year. 
•           Department-sponsored professional development has addressed and will continue to address such topics as 
differentiating instruction for special needs students, a topic which allows us to discuss and plan for those of our students who 
are both special education and ELL designated. 
One of our goals for the 2018-2019 school year is for all team members to meet at least twice a month and create more units 
that are interdisciplinary. Currently, teachers meet to continue to look at curriculum and revise where necessary in order to 
align it with the ESL standards and the instruction required for achieving mastery in English at the commencement level  We 
are implementing the NGSS standards into our  curriculus.  This will include varying instructional practice, introducing students 
to varied texts, providing opportunities for students to use the four modalities in all their classes, which requires that teachers 
are trained in ways to incorporate such into their instruction across the curriculum.  Teachers will be encouraged to continue 
to work together – ELA, NLA, ESL and content area teachers – to discuss students with difficulties whom they share and, 
through case conferencing, find meaningful ways to help the students succeed.  We adhere to both in-house and out 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

professional development in order to better serve our staff and students.  We will aim to have all of our content area teachers 
pursue and acquire their bilingual extensions.  Our ELL team meeting is just another measure of our progress in our school’s 
communication.  
The bilingual coordinator will facilitate monthly PD sessions (7:30 to 8:15 a.m..) for the Bilingual Team.  In addition the team 
will keep working  together on understanding and implementing the NEW citywide instructional expectations, Danielson 
Framework competencies, Common Core standards, School's Instructional Foci, Framework for Great Schools and ELL data to 
drive instruction.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The Bilingual Coordinator constantly monitoring the ELLs progress through progress reports, report cards, transcripts, team 
meetings, student meetings; she sends letters home that personalized and includes data about their child. if the student does 
do well the bilingual coordinators calls parents/ tutors and makes appointment with them, guidance counselor and students to 
create a plan that will help student to be successful in our school In addition, parents are called and encouraged to visit the 
bilingual coordinator's  office any day and at any time through her open-door policy.  Monthly meetings are hold to talk about 
different topics that concern students.     

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jose David Jimenez, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Our school uses home language indicators on ATS, parent conversations, and parent surveys to determine written 
translation and oral interpretation needs. The parent's preferred languages for both written and oral 
communication is either English, Spanish, Chinese Mandarin, French, Arabic, Bengali, Russian and Filipino.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

We have a parent coordinator, bilingual coordinator, and teacher who can speak the various home languages to 
communicate in: SPANISH, FRENCH, and MANDARIN. For languages other than this in an emergency, we would utilize 
the Translation Services of the DOE to ensure we can properly communicate with a parent. Our emergency 
announcement system "Skedula/ioeducation" has a translation service built into text messages, and e-mails. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

Chancellor's Regulations are revisited during School PD Days in September, November, and February. We distribute 
the regulation and pass out the language identification cards and phone number for DOE translations to ensure that 
Teachers can effectively communicate with parents in their preferred language. 

The following are our written translation and oral interpretation needs: 1) all parent memos, letters and fliers need to 
be provided in English and Spanish 2) all phone master messages must be sent in home language of students 3) 
simultaneous translation done by the Parent Coordinator in Spanish and English during Parent Association meetings 
and workshops need to be accessed through translating equipment 4) During open house events, parent-teacher 
conferences, and other school-wide events translators are needed for better communication, not only in Spanish but 
in Asian dialects like Mandarin, French, Arabic, Bengali, Russian and Philipino. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

1) Parents Bill of Rights are available upon registration & through the Parent Coordinator and Guidance Department 2) 
Availability of translation services are posted in the Parent Coordinator's office bulletin board 3) The safety plan 
includes procedures that ensure that all parents have access to administrative communication regardless of language 
barriers 4) The school is aware that the NYCDOE has a translation service to provide memos and documents to 
parents in 8 official languages so that correspondence is understood by parents 5) The schools website will provide 
information in each of the covered 8 languages with regard to the rights of parents to having translation services 
provided when needed.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

1) Surveys received are accounted by our secretarial staff, school aides, parent coordinator, bilingual coordinator and 
bilingual department supervisor. In addition, parents can call our school phone or communicate with any staff 
member via email using our school website to express their questions or concerns on the quality and availability of 
services.
