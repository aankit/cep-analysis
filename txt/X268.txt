Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7 

 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

Mission Statement: At Kingsbridge International High School, we serve recent immigrant English Language Learners 
and prepare them with the linguistic, academic, and cultural skills needed for success in college and careers for all 
students. We integrate language development and content using cooperative learning strategies. Students work 
together in order to complete in-depth projects and develop their communication skills.  

 

At Kingsbridge International High School (KIHS), we believe that all of our immigrant ELL students deserve a quality 
education that will prepare them for the challenges of the future in college and beyond. In order to do so, we provide 
them with the linguistic, cognitive, cultural, social, and emotional skills essential for success. As all students at KIHS 
are English Language Learners, our instructional support systems are tailored for this unique population. We are also 
committed to paying special attention to those students who are high achievers and those who are not achieving to 
their fullest ability; to reach every student in the continuum is our daily goal.

hands-on opportunities they may not be able to have in class. 

 

Learning Partner School - As a New York City Department of Education Learning Partner School, our teachers 
collaborate with those in 2 other schools with the same focus; best supporting English Language Learner students. As 
a learning partner school, we complete inter-visitations with our partners, sharing best practices and supporting each 
other through our challenges. 

 

Thrive Collection - The Thrive Collection works with our art classes to beautify the school through the painting of 
murals. Students identify a theme, and work collaboratively with the Thrive Collection to plan, design, and execute a 
mural within the school building. 

 

Columbia Writing Project - The Columbia Writing Project works collaboratively with both students and teachers to 
develop a creative-writing piece that is published at the conclusion of the project. The work focuses on a student 
interest, and develops the students writing abilities through a creative lens. Teachers are trained on how to best 
implement the curriculum, thus sustaining the project for years to come. 

 

Warning Card Pilot Initiative at Walton Campus, Ramapo for Children - Members of the Ramapo for Children team at 
Walton Campus work collaboratively with administration, guidance counselors, social worker, and the parent 
coordinator to bring Restorative Justice practices to various areas within the school. This includes leading professional 
development for teachers on using RJ circles, assisting in developing the school's re-entry protocol for suspensions, 
and providing feedback on outreach strategies for parents and guardians.

Teacher Leadership Team (TLT) / Distributive Leadership Model - Teachers who have obtained leadership positions 
within the school through the Chancellor’s Leadership Roles are a part of the TLT. They take on leadership 
responsibilities within the school, and use the distributive leadership model as a framework within this context to 
implement the mission and goals of their respective programs. A system for peer observation and inter-visitation for 
members of the teacher leadership team and all faculty members was designed to foster growth of teachers, learners 
and school community towards these specific school goals. Teachers will observe and model methods for 
strengthening practice in alignment with these goals. The plan includes roll out, a marketing strategy to maximize 
teacher participation, pre and post observation feedback protocols and rubrics/criteria for use during observation.  

 

Team members: Iraida Atiles, Brian Mullen, Charles Digruccio, and Katherine Chang (model teachers); Alice Jackson, 
Caesar Yarleque, and Juan Reyes (department leaders) 

 

English Language Development - We have developed an extended day programs to support our students with their 
academic development. We currently have an after school program (Achieve Now Academy) to ensure that our 
students are on track to graduate within four years. Data generated by cohort is used to determine students' 
academic needs. Our grade teams have developed individual academic plans for each student in our graduating 
cohort. 

The cornerstone of our program is the integration of language development within all subject areas through both 
implicit and explicit instruction. Each teacher is responsible for language and content instruction. We use ENL 
methodology to develop language proficiencies in the four modalities in every class. Such strategies include: 

• Explicit, extensive instruction in reading and writing strategies; 

• Multi-level classroom libraries in each discipline; 

• Textbooks at different reading levels for the students to use at home and in school; 

• Extensive use of scaffolding strategies to build on students’ prior linguistic and content knowledge; 

• Writing components to all content area projects; 

• Oral presentation of written work; 

• Debate/Drama presentations, this also includes students creating a visualization of the work studied; 

• Integration of QTEL methodologies in all content areas; 

• Collaborative, interdisciplinary learning projects that reinforce vocabulary and content; 

• Explicit instruction of the aspects of language appropriate to the topic being taught, e.g. past tense in a history class, 
imperatives in a math class, etc. ;

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We currently have 376 (85.3%) ELL students of which 180 (41%) are identified as SIFE. In our School Quality 
Snapshot, our school maintained high rates in Student Progress over the Borough Average. Our School Environment 
scores continue to be well above the city and borough scores. Closing the achievement gap for ELLs and Special 
Needs students were in the top 16%. In addition, we increased our 4-year graduation rate by 3% over the prior 
year, however, we still have work to do in this area. Furthermore, when compared to other ELL students in NYC 
(Bronx community) our 4-year grad rate for the past 4 years exceeds the city ELL average by 14% and our 6-year 
grad rate exceeds the city ELL average by 8.2%. One area of concern for us is our College and Careen Readiness 
index. Although our students are mainly immigrants and don’t all attend college for a variety of reasons, we are 
ensuring that they are provided all the necessary tools and opportunities available. This year we brought on 
another Guidance Counselor whose primary role will be to ensure an effective college readiness program at our 
school. This additional resource will add to our Supportive Environment and increase Strong Family-Community Ties 
with partnerships will multiple colleges and formal and informal workshops with families on the college process. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Kingsbridge International High School has made tremendous progress around collaborative teachers, as evidenced by 
PPO feedback (teacher teams as an area of celebration). Our teachers collaborate in structured, focused department 
teams, with an alignment to our instructional focus. Teachers work together through inquiry cycles, including setting 
team goals and criteria for analysis of student work, lesson plan tuning, inter-visitations, and looking at student work 
examples. 

Our instructional focus this year is around rigorous instruction, and more specifically, using classroom discussion 
techniques. Our students, who are all English Language Learners or former ELLs, have unique challenges that require 
our teachers to adjust their instructional practices to best support our students. The primary barrier toward 
graduation continues to be our English Common Core Exam pass rate (45% 65 or higher, 53% 55 or higher). Our 
professional development plan will focus on English Language development for all students, using discussion as a 
means to provide students with those opportunities, as evidenced in student writing.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans  

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, 
and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious 
intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support) 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice 
Tenet 3 Statement of Practice 
Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan. 
3.2 

The school leader ensures and supports the quality implementation of a systematic plan of 
rigorous and coherent curricula appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning 
Standards (CCLS) that is monitored and adapted to meet the needs of students. 
Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction 
(DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and 
address student achievement needs. 
The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner 
within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the 
arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities. 
Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative 
assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student 
reflection, tracking of, and ownership of learning.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths: The teachers at KIHS use varied leveled text to ensure that the material is differentiated for all students, 
regardless of content or English Language ability level. This leads to high levels of engagement by all students, and 
prepares students for the next level or grade (82% positive student responses, school survey, 2017-18). 

 

Priority Needs: With a student population that comprised of 85.3% ELL students, our priority need is English Language 
Development in all courses. The language barrier our students face has been the most detrimental to their progress, as 
the ELA Regents Exam results continue to be an area in need of improvement (53% passing rate, 2017-2018 school 
year). With a stronger development of their English Language, not only will the ELA Regents Exam results increase, but 
there will also be an increase in credit accumulation and Regents pass rates across all areas. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified

priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, we will effectively deepen teacher practice in building students' literacy skill as across all content areas, as 
evidenced by a 7% increase in pass rate on the ELA Common Core Regents exam, from 53% to 57%.

The instructional focus for the 2018-19 school year was developed 
to provide the necessary support for all of our students, particularly 
our ELL students: 

All students 

Sept 5 - June 
17 

Teachers will foster students' verbal production of language across 
content areas by integrating questioning and discussion techniques 
into their daily planning. Teachers will utilize these techniques to 
cultivate students' analytical thinking, measured by student writing. 

Select ELA and ENL teachers will participate in an 8-week coaching 
cycle with an ELL Services Administrator and Instructional Coach 
from the Affinity FSC, focused on implementing the 2018-2019 
instructional focus and improving instruction for ELLs.  

All teachers will implement a language objective within lesson and 
unit plans (based on SIOP model of teaching), supporting the 
students' English language proficiency. Professional development 
and observation feedback is necessary to develop teachers' 
language objective writing and implementation. Progress will be 
tracked in observation feedback as well as student progress in 
reading comprehension through use of the Renaissance STAR 
Assessment. 

Teachers of all content areas will participate in Professional 
Development sessions facilitated by ElevatED Learning Services, 
focusing on collaborative group work using micro-structuring, to 
increase student engagement and ELL English language proficiency.  

Teachers will use quarterly assessments to guide instruction for 
upcoming unit and lesson plans. They will track student progress 
four times throughout the school year, with the results being used 
to guide instructional decisions at the level of unit and daily lesson 
plans.  

By implementing the Bridges to Academic Success program, 16 of 
our 9th grade SIFE students will have the opportunity to participate 
in a researched-based, individually tailored program in their ENL and 
ELA classes, to develop their English Proficiency skills, as well as their 
reading comprehension in their native language.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
Kingsbridge International High School will engage families in understanding and supporting Rigorous instruction in the 
following ways: 

(1) Teachers will use parent outreach time to contact parents, as well as invite them in, to discuss their child's 
progress. 

(2) Open School Evenings will comprise of a discussion around the course expectations and how parents can support 
their child's progress. 

(3) We will host a "curriculum night," inviting families in to meet their child's teacher and discuss the course 
expectations, as well as how to support their child. 

(4) Parents will be given access to Jupiter Grades online grade book to track their child's academic progress and 
attendance. They will also be able to use Jupiter to communicate with their child's teachers. 

(5) We will provide parents English courses so they themselves can learn English and better support their child's 
English language proficiency development. 

(6) Staff will be trained in how to use the DOE's Over-the-Phone Interpretation Service to communicate with parents 
who speak languages other than English.  

The parent coordinator, as well as teacher grade teams, will ensure that outreach is completed. All teachers are 
responsible for updating Jupiter Grades online grade book to best communicate with parents. 
 

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 

Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
Teachers will be offered per session to provide students with their after school support coursework, with per session 
being funded by Title IV funding. We will also use teacher C6 assignment time as Professional Learning time. During 
this period, teachers will work collaboratively to ensure their instruction is rigorous and aligned to the goal of English 
Language development.  

The CUNY support network will work with groups of our teachers to ensure the highest levels of instruction, providing 
supports around differentiating and scaffolding for our ELL student population.

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Supportive Environment in order to 
support  the  whole  child?  Include  the  timeline  and  identify  key  personnel  and  stakeholders  responsible  for 
implementation and oversight. 
Families will receive daily outreach in regards to their child's social-emotional development through Jupiter Grades, 
and teacher outreach.  KIHS will also implement an "open-door" policy, allowing parents to come into school when 
they are available to check on their child's progress in class. We believe in the Triangle of Success that is created 
through sustained partnerships between the school, families, and the local community. This inclusive approach 
validates the roles of all stakeholders responsible for the success of the school. 

Families will also have access to real time attendance data through use of Jupiter Grades online system.  

Key personnel responsible for the implementation of this work are the Parent Coordinator, Social worker, Guidance 
Counselors, teachers, and administrators. All per-session activities will be funded using Title IV funds.

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths: There is a clear sense of unity and collaboration among the staff (100% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed 
that teachers talk with one another about their instruction - 2017-18 School Quality Guide). Staff members hold each 
other accountable for being present and engaged in the team meetings, and they work together to set norms and 
department and grade level goals. 

Priority Needs: Teachers do not have a set of shared understandings around teaching strategies that provide multiple 
entry points, such as structures for student conversations, to engage students and encourage higher order thinking skills 
in student work products (Principal Performance Review, 2017-18).

Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-need 
student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, SIFE, 
STH). 

Teachers will meet in department level teams twice a week, 
completing an inquiry cycle around English language development, 
including setting department instructional goals and criteria of 
analysis for student work, using the tuning protocol to tune lesson 
plans, completing inter-visitations, and using the learning from a 
student work protocol to guide instructional decisions. The focus for 
the inquiry cycles this year is using discussion strategies to cultivate 
students' analytical thinking. 

Teachers will meet in grade level teams once a week, establishing 
norms in classroom structures, routines, and instructional strategies, 
including rubric use, assessment alignment, and expectations 
norming. Teachers will utilize a kid talk protocol to engage in 
collaborative conversations to increase student productivity.  

The integrated co-teaching program will be supported through an 
in-house professional learning series in which expectations around 
co-teaching are communicated, ongoing learning walks conducted 
by administration to assess progress, in the context of observation 
cycles - discussion of co-teaching practices with ICT teachers 
referencing Advance ratings, inter-visitations among co-teaching 
pairs, and attendance by teachers at ICT PDs led by Affinity FSC. A 
focus of development of ICT will be formative assessment.  

In department teams, teachers will look at school-wide student 
assessment data (NYSESLAT, Regents exams, and STAR Renaissance 
Reading, Math and Spanish results) to inform department-wide 
instructional practices that address needs identified in the data.  

Teacher leaders and Assistant Principal will attend Professional 
Learning opportunities through Affinity, CUNY, and Teacher Careers 
Pathways Office to better their practice as team leaders, facilitators, 
and teachers of lab classrooms.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Collaborative Teachers and strategies 
to promote teacher-parent/family collaborations in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and 
identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
Families will be engaged with collaborative teachers and strategies being used by school staff to promote 
collaboration with families in the following ways: 

(1) During Parent Outreach time, grade teams contact and invite parents in for meetings, with and without their child, 
to discuss progress and supports being implemented across the team.  

(2) Open School Evenings & Curriculum night. 

(3) Ongoing guidance interventions where our counselors meet minimally twice a semester with the student/parent. 

(4) The school Social Worker is also a vital part of this work, as she serves to support families in crisis, and those with a 
minimum understanding of the financial and social emotional resources that the school and community make 
available to those in need.  

The parent coordinator is responsible for outreach and planning for open school evenings and curriculum night. Grade 
level teacher teams are responsible for outreach to parents. Finally, guidance counselors will meet twice with 
individual students throughout the year. 
 

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 

Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
This goal is resourced by providing teachers with a C6 assignment that is focused on Teacher Team work. Teachers 
and Assistant Principals will also be sent to PD through Affinity and CUNY. Finally, four model teachers will be hired to 
lead PD and open their doors for best practices and mentorship.

This will be monitored through the vehicle of teacher teams by using protocols to look at student work samples; and 
by administrators and guidance counselors through the online grade book Jupiter Grades. We will implement 
interventions for students that are not on track to pass their regents exams, as per their quarterly exam results.  

We are also working to gain access to the New Visions for Public School data portal and platform, that holds a wealth 
of data related to student progress and outcomes. Thus, enabling faculty, guidance, and administrative teams to 
support student progress using quantitative data to target individual students, or sub-sets of students.

meetings, assessment use and design is discussed, along with the use of rubrics and aligning expectations. Through 
these practices, teachers will develop 4 common-assessments (one each quarter), and will use the data from those 
exams to determine best instructional best steps. The results from these assessments will also lead to teacher inter-
visitations and the sharing of best instructional strategies. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           47 

 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Kingsbridge International High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of 
Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Kingsbridge International High School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           49 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events;

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

Kingsbridge International High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student 
Succeeds Act (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student 
achievement between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and 
programs funded by Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will 
share responsibility for improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be 
developed to ensure that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.

Begin description here:            
At Kingsbridge International High School (KIHS), we believe that all of our immigrant ELL 
students deserve a quality education that will prepare them for the future of college and 
career.  In order to do so, we provide them with the linguistic, cognitive, cultural, social, and 
emotional skills essential for success.   
As all students at KIHS are English Language Learners, our instructional support systems are 
tailored for this unique population.    We are also committed to paying special attention to those 
students who are high achievers and those who are not achieving to their fullest ability; to reach 
every student in the continuum is our daily goal.  We currently have 434 ELL students of which 
188 are SIFE. 
We have developed an extended day program to support our students with their academic 
development.  We currently have an after PM school (6 Teachers with rotating schedules) and at 
our Saturday Academy (4 Teachers) to ensure that our students support in language acquisition, 
academic language and content areas.  The four licensed ENL teachers' will be supported with 
Title III funds.  These teachers will be pushing into the whole group and small group students 
taught by non-ENL certified content area teachers.   
The data used for student selection both extended day programs (PM and Saturday) come from 
multiple sources including but not limited to:  NYSESLAT results, NYSITEL results, ELA 
Regents Exams, teacher assessments and teacher recommendations within their vertical and 
horizontal team meetings.  Both programs service  9, 10, 11, and 12 grade students.  Students in 
most cases are grouped by NYSESLAT level within content area when possible.  
Title III designated classes, teachers and frequency are as follows:   
•        "PM SCHOOL ENL/Bilingual Faculty: English/ENL, Math, Math, 2-ENL, Social Studies, 
Math, English, and Science.   These 6 teachers are identified as service providers for the 210 
ELLs participating in the program for a total of 22 two-hour sessions, Monday through 
Thursday, from 3:00 - 5:00 PM.  This program will begin on September 22, 2018, and end June 
9, 2019.  The PM program utilizes 7 classrooms with an average teacher to student ratio of 13 to 
1.  
In most cases an ENL teacher will team teach with a non-ENL certified content area 
teacher.  The supplemental instructional materials are teacher created in addition to the day 
school materials already in use.   
•         "SATURDAY ACADEMY ENL/Bilingual Faculty.  Math, ENL, Science, and 
ELA.  These 4 teachers serviced 100 ELLs in this program for a total of 15 sessions of four-hour 
each, 8:00 AM - 12:00 PM.  This program utilizes 4 classrooms with an average teacher to 
student ratio of 1 to 13.  The program is scheduled to begin December 1, 2018, and end June 8, 
2019.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
Both the PM and Saturday programs supports students across grades 9, 10, 11, and 12.  Students 
are grouped in 3 main categories within each grade level: 
1. Entering  and Emerging 
2. Transitioning and Expanding 
3. Commanding 
SIFE students participate in both programs and receive supplemental instruction in small 
groups.   
These programs are geared towards academic support and language acquisition ELL students 
experience as they transition into the use of a new language, English. We also offer enrichment 
programs for our students who have met or maintained the state mandated progress of their 
cohort for graduation. All grade levels (9, 10, 11, 12) are offered the school program, as well as 
during the Saturday Academy. Our SIFE students and our low performers (bottom third in each 
grade) on the NYSITEL exam are the subgroups that are heavily targeted to attend our 
supplemental academic programs. Students attend the program.  The classes being taught by 
trained ENL staff teach in their classrooms with class libraries, Smart Boards, and all the 
necessary materials for proper and appropriate instruction for our 100% ELL population. The 
program runs for the entire school year, from September to June. All classes are given in English 
with ENL support.  All teachers use ENL strategies on a daily basis. Translation services are 
provided by teachers and/or other staff members. We use our advanced students to translate to 
parents in Arabic, Bengali, Italian, or French as needed. The materials used are mainly teacher 
created materials, smart boards, computers and other technology to enhance instruction. 
A lion's share of licensed ESL teachers is always on hand for every single session of our two 
programs. These programs gives us the opportunity to reach at least fifty percent of our 
population with various programs including Physical Education, Book Club, Chess Club, SAT 
Vocabulary, Science Enrichment, Rosetta Stone English and Native language building, and Math 
Solutions.  
Students have access to on-line programs Rosetta Stone and Destination Math. Students will also 
make use of classroom libraries to read a more diverse selection of books. These students will 
also attend a “writing center” twice a week to improve organization of essays, and to write in 
styles that enhance learning and preparation for college courses. Students will participate in 
writing opinion based essays and research based essays as per the NYS Core Curriculum 
standards. 
The cornerstone of our program is the integration of language development within all subject 
areas through both implicit and explicit instruction. Each teacher is responsible for language and 
content instruction. Rather than having classes designated as “ENL classes”, we use ENL 
methodology to develop language proficiencies in the four modalities in every class. Such 
strategies include: 
•     Explicit, extensive instruction in reading and writing strategies;  
•     Multi-level classroom libraries in each discipline;  
•     Textbooks at different reading levels for the students to use at home and in school, such as 
the extensive "Windows and Mirrors" program that we purchased for our English Department; 
•     Extensive use of scaffolding strategies to build on students’ prior linguistic and content 
knowledge;  
•     Writing components to all content area projects;  
•     Oral presentation of written work; 
•     Debate/Drama presentations, this also includes students creating a visualization of the work 
studied;  
•     Integration of QTEL methodologies in all content areas; 
•     Collaborative, interdisciplinary learning projects that reinforce vocabulary and content;

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
•     Explicit instruction of the aspects of language appropriate to the topic being taught, e.g. past 
tense in a history class, imperatives in a math class, etc. ; 
•     Common Core Tasks; 
The program has 4 teachers with ENL certification. The teachers work in collaborative groups to 
make sure that each student receives appropriate ENL services and instructional methodologies. 
The major model of the program is cooperative buddy and team teaching.

Begin description here:            
  
  
Since our school is comprised of 100% ELLs, our professional development (PD) is provided 
without using Title III funding.  All meetings outlined below are documented by agendas and 
sign-in sheets filed in binders in our Assistant Principal's Office 215.  Our PD plan for the school 
year provides ongoing dedicated times for ENL strategies and supports.  These times are usually 
held during our Monday PD and Chancellor Conference Days. 
Teachers work together in small cluster teams to develop challenging and engaging 
interdisciplinary, project-based curricula.  They share ways in which to embed multiple 
opportunities for language development across all subject areas.  At daily meetings, weekly 
grade level, content area, and Monday afternoon PD, they sit down together not only to discuss 
the progress of their shared community of learners, but to critique each other’s work through the 
analysis of student writing and feedback from peer observations.  In addition to these times, we 
use full day PD activities on Election Day and other student non-attendance days to get 
additional instruction from outside agencies including experts in ELL populations.  Our lead 
teachers and former ENL teachers, from Columbia University and outside agencies such as 
instruction by NYC Leadership Academy, all take an active role in these many opportunities for 
training our entire staff. 
It is essential to the success of this system that teachers are up to date and universally informed 
regarding the nature of assessment criteria, procedures, and uses of data.  We achieve this by 
having a core assessment team who engage in workshops with all teachers to transfer 
information, and for group learning.  Most decisions and directions of process are made after 
careful deliberation, dialogue, and by democratic means.  This allows us to have a strong 
collective backbone.  Every Monday afternoon each week, all teachers meet for 80 minutes for 
professional development as per UFT contract.  This is a time to discuss student achievement, 
lesson plans, and other activities.  During this time, there will specific attention given to rigorous 
curricula, questioning techniques, assessment development, thus involving all teachers on a very 
regular basis.  The daily professional period for all teachers is reserved for planning in their 
teams as well as time for team teaching and peer observation

Part C: Professional Development  
The rationale for our professional development is to ensure that our students are provided the 
best possible ELL instruction. All of our teachers receive training on a weekly basis during the 
Principal's weekly PD sessions. The entire staff meets every Monday to discuss ELL strategies, 
our inquiry work project, student achievement and progress and Regents readiness for our 
students. The staff meets every Monday from 2:30 P.M. - 3:35 P.M. and these PD's run for the 
duration of the school year. The New York City Leadership Academy coach provides monthly 
Professional Development.  Our ENL teachers meet every Thursday along with our ELA 
teachers from 1:06 PM to 1:51 PM where co-planning and ELA supports are developed.  
 

 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact

  how parents will be notified of these activities 

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
The rationale for all of our parent engagement activities is to increase parental involvement in 
the education process of our students. We provide translation services for all the parents in the 
languages required.  Mostly Spanish, but we also have translators, sometimes high level students, 
translate Bengali, French, Arabic, among others as required by the parents' involved. 
The UFT contract now provides faculty 75 minutes on Tuesday afternoons to engage with 
parents.  Faculty use this time to administer telephone calls, generate student progress reports for 
mailing and parents are invited to meet with their child's teacher grade teams.  We also hold 
frequent meetings and events for parents to ask questions to teachers about their child’s 
performance.  To supplement this, we hold informational sessions to discuss our assessment 
tools and demystify the process, so they feel comfortable engaging in meaningful dialogues with 
the school regarding their student’s achievement. 
Using these methods, we can ensure that students are meeting expectations and can determine 
the reasons why a student is not.  From there, both the school and families can move forward 
together to best help their child succeed. We want parents to be fully immersed in the culture of 
our school, and to be an integral part of their child's education. The activities we provide to 
parents in addition to all of the mandated activities are a parent orientation in August to 
familiarize the parents with the school's mission and the methodology of our classroom teachers; 
we also inform parents of state requirements for graduation as well as all of our after school 
programs. We also have monthly PTA meetings on the 3rd Wednesday of every month from 
5:00 PM to 6:00 PM, to discuss critical and current school issues such as upcoming Regents 
exams, grading policies and credit accumulation. Our notifications are done through mailings in 
multiple languages, phone calls and emails with the Guidance Counselor and the Social Worker 
by following up on the initial contact to make sure that parents are aware of the informational 
meetings.  It is difficult not to be informed.  This procedure provides the necessary results by 
having a high percentage of parents attend the many functions dedicated to only parents. We do 
not use any Title III funds to support these workshops.  These workshops/meetings are supported 
through other school funds.  As noted in our budget, we use our Title III allocation to support our

after school programs.  Agendas, sign-in sheets and copy of materials are documented in our 
Assistant Principal's Office 215. 
The PTA meets on Wednesday of the month for two hours from 5:00 pm to 6:00 pm.  Example 
agendas items to be covered but not limited to are, Rosetta Stone for all languages, the school

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
ELLs are given periodic assessments as a tool to evaluate student progress throughout the course of the school year. These 
assessments include, but are not limited to, multiple "check for understanding" strategies, Renaissance STAR Assessment, 
the NYSITELL, the NYSESLAT, and teacher generated formative and summative assessments.  These assessments assist in the 
teacher's ability to adjust curriculum to meet the state standards associated with the ENL program.  This information informs 
the overall instruction that is provided within each ENL classroom. The data is collected and the proficiency levels are 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63 

 

 

examined. The proficiency levels of the students are distributed to the teachers on grade levels and those teachers create 
appropriate differentiated instructional plans for that particular grade level. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The Annual Assessment Calendar provides a clear schedule for quarterly assessments, state exams, and College Board tests. 
Professional development is provided on how to create assessments and analyze the data.  Administration, CUNY Affinity 
instructional staff, and Ramapo instructional coaches work with teachers. Model teachers, and ENL teachers support this effort 
throughout the school year on grade and department teams. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of our ENL program is measured by student progress on the NYSESLAT examination.  Additionally, students are 
assessed throughout the year using alternative forms of assessments.  Renaissance STAR Assessment provides data 
throughout the year and allows us to benchmark the progress of our ENL program. The ultimate barometer of the success of 
our programs are determined and measured by student performance on New York State Regents exams and our graduation 
rate. Additionally, guidance counselors do quarterly transcript evaluations to evaluate the students' progress within their 
cohort to measure credit accumulation and Regents performance.    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once formative assessment data is analyzed within the grade and department teams, it used to inform instruction and student 
support on an ongoing basis. Students identified as in need of further instructional support and scheduled to attend the after 
school Achieve Now Academy. While the NYSESLAT is administered in May and official results are available in August, our ENL 
team unofficially reviews the exams to gather data to inform their instruction for the rest of the school year and summer 
programs.  When the official results are made available, students’ schedules are adjusted to comply with CR Part 154 
regulations and provide extended and targeted support for the students.   
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Not ApplicableELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Noticeable patterns across different NYSESLAT modalities represent a necessity for instructional changes. When these patterns 
arise, grade teams work identify instructional changes to be made across the grade level and department teams identify what 
needs to be changed in the curriculum. Reading and writing have historically been the areas of highest need. These are the 
skills that the ENL teachers primarily focus on in their standalone ENL classes for Entering and Emerging students. English 
proficient students are provided with necessary support past their enrollment in the ENL program. Results from Regents 
exams are focused on in department teams, with curriculum modifications made to address the areas of highest student need. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Because our school comprises all immigrant students, 88% of whom are ELLs, the structures set up to disseminate findings to 
make adjustments to our program ELLs are used for all students at our school.  Grade and Department teams meet twice 
weekly to collect and analyze ELL data. These analyses are used to reflect on past instruction and inform future instruction.

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

All our students are ELLs and are grouped heterogeneously in all classes.  During teacher team meetings and common 
planning time, teachers analyze student work and modify past, current, and future curricula to ensure we address the 
evolving needs or our ELL students.  During the common planning time and teacher team meetings, an ENL certified 
teacher collaborates on the curriculum and strategies that should be incorporated into curricula, lesson plans and 
classroom pedagogue.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Our school employs a dedicated ENL and ELA teacher for each grade level.  These teachers will deliver the minimum 
required number of minutes as outlined below in chart 5.2 (Part 154-2 (9-12) English as New Language).  In compliance with 
the New York City Department of Education’s Division of Assessment and Accountability, all modifications for ELLs are 
implemented for city and state examinations. Explicit instruction is delivered by a certified ENL teacher to students. Students 
testing advanced on the NYSESLAT are programmed for at least 180 minutes of English Language Arts. Our students travel in 
blocks and have a heterogeneous mix.  Student testing Commanding/Proficient receive a minimum of 90 minutes of ENL 
instruction per week.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Content area instruction is delivered in English.  We have established a LEP team which includes the principal, Borough ELL 
Compliance Specialist, ENL and ELA teachers, Native Language Arts teacher, and school counselors. Newly enrolled LEP 
students receive an array of academic and support services. We offer regents and SAT prep classes, mandated tutorials in core 
content areas, Saturday Academy enrichment programs, and a myriad of extra-curricular clubs and sports activities. Our 
teachers employ the workshop model in our classes and students are grouped with different levels of English within the class. 
This is done to ensure that content becomes comprehensible and to enrich language development through the students' 
peers. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   ELL students receive evaluation in their native language by a certified pedagogue. A large percentage of our incoming 
students are Spanish speaking. The certified Spanish teacher and other teachers with bilingual extensions evaluate the 
students in their native language for fluency and placement. The methods for evaluation include competency exams, 
interviews in native language and their ability to speak, write and read in their native languages is monitored by teachers in 
grade level teams.          
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           65

ELL subgroups receive differentiated instruction though content areas where QTEL scaffolding strategies are 
implemented.  ELL and SIFE students receive Native Language instruction.  In addition to items above,  ELL students are 
enrolled in online programs Achieve 3000, Rosetta Stone and SCANTRON for Literacy support. Students at different levels are 
provided with literacy and language support in both their native language (when possible) and English. Our plan for SIFE 
students is to closely monitor their attendance in coordination with the guidance counselor and the individual grade teams. 
The grade teams administer baseline exams in their respective departments and then create an academic plan based on the 
ability of the student. Our SIFE students are enrolled into our P.M. School and Saturday academy also. Our newcomers (less 
than 3 years) are teamed up with a student buddy whose English level is advanced in order to expedite the process of learning 
English. All newcomers are evaluated in grade teams to ascertain their strengths and weaknesses and to teach them 
accordingly. Our plan for Long-Term ELLs is to continue their process for English language development using P.M. and 
Saturday academy for both enrichment and regents requirements. We have after school writing programs and verbal SAT prep 
for student achievement.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers of ELL-SWDs receive ongoing professional development pertaining to their content area.  QTEL (Quality Teaching for 
English Learners) is presented as a tool to assist instructors in meeting the needs of students with disabilities. Pedagogues are 
given access to Achieve 3000 and school generated assessments as a means to facilitate student language acquisition. Our 
instructional strategy includes workshop model, weekly grade and subject team meetings to assess student achievement and 
create alternative strategies for lower achieving students. These strategies include scaffolding for the writing process focusing 
on sentence and paragraph development as opposed to writing large essays they may not be capable of at that time. All 
teachers have grade appropriate textbooks and literature to assist instruction, computers and Smartboards are available to 
every teacher, and all grade teams are conducting inquiry work in an attempt to increase student vocabulary skills.           
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
We have approximately 15 student with disabilities in our school.  Teacher Teams address the needs and learning disabilities of 
our SWDs during common planning time.  Student IEPs are shared via SESIS with our staff of SWDs.  A special education 
teacher pushes into classes when required by a student's IEP.  Furthermore, all our SWDs are in the least restricted 
environment. All are currently classified as SETTS.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
During daily inter/intra departmental common-planning periods, teachers create unit/lesson plans that require students to be 
actively involved in learning, ask them to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate information, and develop products and 
performances for real audiences and purposes, authentic assessments.  ENL instruction, using ENL strategies and 
methodologies, is aligned to the ELA Common Core/NYS Standards and Regents tasks.  Discrete skills and concepts are taught 
explicitly and rubrics that stem from the standards and performance indicators are used as tools for assessment for all written 
assignments and oral presentations.   Rubrics are supported with examples and anchors that illustrate the various levels of 
performance for students.  A Balanced Literacy approach is used across the core curricula.  All ninth grade students are 
scheduled for ninety-minute blocks for mathematics and ELA classes. Interventions for Social Studies includes an ENL support 
teacher for every regents level course. The support teacher has a primary focus of increasing the reading,writing and 
document analysis skills necessary for students to pass regents exams and increase college readiness. Interventions for science

includes a looping of the living environment teacher in which the 9th grade teacher moves to the 10th grade with the same 
students for continuity for regents exams. There are daily A.M , P.M. classes for both Science and Social Studies. In Science and 
Math, P.M. classes and Saturday classes are available in their native language.    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

In addition to stand-alone ENL classes, our ENL teachers will perform additional push-in instructional support in content areas 
for student the LPT recommends.  In addition, the school will be hiring an additional ENL teacher to support this new push-in 
program.  In addition, we will expand on the services already provided.  Incorporate Rosetta Stone Language software in 
English for our ELL and SIFE students. Other programs we have incorporated is our school wide inquiry based project on 
improving academic vocabulary. We plan to have once again a cooking class in which the students write recipes in English, and 
a fitness class in which students are required to keep nutritional journals to help increase literacy. We have initiated the "City 
Chicken" program where our students build and raise chickens on school grounds and record multiple observations and make 
collaborative decisions on the project success.  Our students and their families each year engage in "Garden Day"  where they 
learn about horticulture, work the land, plant shrubs and trees, and take pride in their effort to beautify our campus.  Lastly, 
out traditional P.M. and Saturday classes will be geared to help student achievement and maintain students on a path to 
graduate in 4 years. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

None 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELL students are not excluded from any programs or clubs at our school.  Furthermore, in addition to items listed in #9, our ELL 
beginners receive an additional instructional period in their daily program. The funding source for come from the school 
budget and various grants.We have programs before and after school, as well as on Saturdays to help increase student 
achievement. The goals of our before and after school programs, as well as Saturday academy are to increase literacy, assist in 
the learning of English and to assist all students pass their state mandated regents exams to stay on course for graduation.    
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Interactive Smart Boards, Laptops Computers,  dual-language dictionaries, Native Language content area textbooks, and 
literacy libraries. All teachers have textbooks, Regents review materials and classroom libraries to help increase literacy. 
Teachers have access to discovery education to supplement lessons, as well as the wizard test maker which helps to assess 
regents readiness.       
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language support is a paramount concern for students labeled as SIFE; when possible, these students are programmed 
for 240 minutes of weekly instruction in their native language in order to facilitate skill development.  Much of this curriculum 
is aligned with the ENL and ELA classes in order to ensure comprehension, vocabulary acquisition, and foundational writing 
skills. Currently, there are seven Spanish native language instructors on faculty. Additionally, there are 3ENL instructors on 
faculty.  Native language support is critical in the overall development of students’ second language skills. The needs of 
students in English only classes are addressed on a case-by-case basis. Students are encouraged to utilize first language skills to 
further their development and understanding in their second language. Our native language instruction is done primarily in our 
P.M. and A.M. schools. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Required services and support correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels by assessing students needs in grade teams and 
placing the students into corresponding A.M. and P.M. classes based on ability. For example, we may have an eleventh grader 
writing on an 8th or 9th grade level, which would prompt teachers to place the student in a lower level after school class in 
order to acquire the necessary skills.

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Interactive Smart Boards, Laptops Computers,  dual-language dictionaries, Native Language content area textbooks, and 
literacy libraries. All teachers have textbooks, Regents review materials and classroom libraries to help increase literacy. 
Teachers have access to discovery education to supplement lessons, as well as the wizard test maker which helps to assess 
regents readiness.       
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
For new students to our school who were "list-noticed" to us, we have an orientation prior to the school year where materials 
are distributed, presentations from staff are made, and a Question-and-Answer forum is provided.  However, more than half 
our new students come "over-the-counter" as newly arrived students to the country during the months of September and 
October.  A preliminary conference is held with the student, the family, and a welcome team of staff.  Additionally, we have a 
peer-to-peer mentoring program for new students, where upper level and successful students mentor new students during 
their first year. Beginning the summer of 2015 we will make an effort to provide a "Bridge-to-High School" program to our new 
students.    
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Students are offered Native language instruction during PM School and Saturday Academy enrichment. As of now, we only 
offer Spanish electives , however we are working to incorporate French, Arabic and Bengali into our P.M. school curriculum. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Not Applicable 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
All our students are ELLs, therefore all staff have a weekly 80 minute PD meeting every Monday afternoon. This is a recent 
addition to the new UFT Contract. Instructional strategy is a component of every weekly PD meeting. Teachers share 
instructional strategies at these meetings, with specific detail and attention paid to our ENL learners. We have outside people 
attend meetings periodically  in an attempt to provide new insights. One person from each department will attend an outside 
PD and turn-key other members of their respective department.  
During daily inter/intra departmental common-planning periods, teachers create unit/lesson plans that require students to be 
actively involved in learning, ask them to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate information, and develop products and 
performances for real audiences and purposes, authentic assessments.  ENL instruction, using ENL strategies and 
methodologies, is aligned to the ELA Performance Standards, Common Core Learning Standards and Regents tasks.  Discrete 
skills and concepts are taught explicitly and rubrics that stem from the standards and performance indicators are used as tools 
for assessment for all written assignments and oral presentations.   Rubrics are supported with examples and anchors that 
illustrate the various levels of performance for students.  A Balanced Literacy approach is used across the core curricula.

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Teachers, particularly in 9th grade, are trained to assist ELLs as they transition from one school level to another through our in-
house weekly PD meetings. Our ENL teachers provide specific strategies to the staff in order to create the smoothest transition 
possible for ELLs as they transition from one school level to the next. 
The minimum of 7.5 hours of ELL training is easily met in our weekly PD meetings. Teachers share research based strategies on 
the most effective ELL instruction. Records of these meetings are kept by the Principal as he creates the weekly agenda.   
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Parents are involved in the process of placing students into ESL at the beginning of the school year or when new ELLs enter the 
system. Parents are invited to be a part of the School Leadership Team, Principal Round Table Meetings, Open School events, 
Parental Workshops, access Community Based Organization, as well as the Parent Teacher Association. Monthly meetings and 
additional workshops are held throughout the school year.  With the new UFT Contract, 75 minutes of teacher time is solely 
devoted to parental involvement.  Parents meet with Teacher Teams and/or individual teachers to discuss their child's 
progress as well as social/emotional development.  The identification process for potential English Language Learners begins 
with this intake team. Members of the LPT have new students to New York City complete documents such as the Home 
Language Survey. Once parents notate a language other than English on the Home Language Survey, students are then 
earmarked for the NYSITELL/LAB-R. According to the NYSITELL/LAB-R results, students are placed into levels based of ENL in 
compliance with their needs according to the assessment. Needs of parents are assessed via the learning environment survey 
and discussed during School Leadership Team meetings. Additionally, parents are invited to formal and informal meetings 
where we discuss the success of our English language learners and possibilities for ensuring that the students are actually given 
the support that they need. These meetings take place each semester. We are in the process of creating literacy classes to 
involve the parents of our English Language Learners in an attempt to ensure that they feel welcome and can transition into 
English-Speaking settings.  In-house survey administered by the staff is also utilized to address the the needs of parents.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Our parental involvement activities include surveys, parent-teacher conferences, monthly PTA meetings. Parents are invited to 
attend our weekly grade team meetings to discuss the progress of their child. Parents are also provided with a Rosetta Stone 
account and we are currently working to create a English class at night for parents.  Parents are included in school events such 
as our Garden Day, Talent Show, and cultural trips.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, William Gagstetter, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

We determine the primary language through home language surveys, student interviews and social worker phone 
calls. We also use the NYC DOE Blue Emergency Contact cards as a source of language data. This process is 
completed immediately but no later than 30 days of a student’s enrollment. All of our students are immigrant 
children, therefore the staff knows our children are ELLs and that extraordinary measures must be taken to 
communicate with parents. In addition to the HLIS, we utilize Emergency Contact Sheets, ATS Reports listing home 
languages and preferred spoken languages. We have full translation available for our students and all letters to 
the house are written in English and the other native languages. 

Our staff discusses the language barriers that exist in our daily professional development meetings.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

Our first and fastest line of communication to families in an emergency situation is the automated School Messenger 
phone calling system which can call the entire school in less than 20 minutes. In the event that the school needs to be 
evacuated, the outgoing phone message will be modified to provide relative information. If the situation requires 
further communication, the school will notify the superintendent and central DOE offices to perhaps use media to

Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

At the beginning of each school year, several Chancellor’s Regulations are reviewed with the faculty in detail. Being 
a school of immigrant students, Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 (Translations) is one regulation presented in its 
entirety and discussed by our Language Access Coordinator. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Parents will receive a letter at the start of the school year in both English and translated into their native language, 
asking for translation services required for parent teacher conferences, PTA meetings, as well as additional school 
events. All written communication will be translated in the appropriate language for the families. 

Through use of the Department of Educations translation services, as well as hired translation services, all written 
communication, including letters mailed home, web communication, and flyers in the school, will be translated into 
the families home languages.  

For PTA meetings, parent teacher conferences, and additional school events, translators will be hired for families who 
require them.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

The NYC Learning Environment Survey will be used to gather feedback from parents in regards to communication 
supports and language services they receive. The survey will be provided in the families home language. 

The parent coordinator will also send home a survey in the families home language, asking about the services they 
received as well as how those services can be improved upon.
