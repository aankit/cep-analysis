Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The acronym for our mission statement is We C.A.R.E. C is for consistent communication between all people within 
our organization especially and most importantly, inclusion of our parents/guardians. We are also focused on 
strengthening the communication skills of each and every child within our organization. A is, and continues, to be 
applauding the efforts that are produced by all of our students and staff as well as assessing all of our teaching 
methods and curriculum for the impact it has on our students. R is for continued research in finding new and 
innovative programs that will inspire and motivate our students , as well as the rigor that we present to our students, 
staff and parents/guardians on a daily basis. E is for the effort and education that we produce that impacts on our 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

students and the achieving of their goals. This statement continues to be a main focus for all of us who work within 
our organization, it establishes a culture of consistency, caring and respect for all of our students. This year, we will 
plan to emphasize as many workshops as possible along with teacher input in assisting our parents/guardians in the 
home settings. Many of our parents/guardians need to develop and carry over valuable tools that will make their lives 
and their child's lives much more productive in their homes. Whether a schedule needs to be made or helpful 
suggestions in developing behavior plans in the home environment, we are going to educate and assist all of our 
parents/guardians. 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P177 continues to be a multi-sited organization within District 75. Our four sites consist of the following locations: 

177@Main Site which educates four hundred and thirty students with developmental disabilities ranging in age from 
8-21 years of age. Ratios represented at this site are 6:1:1, 8:1:1 and 12:1:1. 

 

177@295 is composed of eight classes of which five classes are of 6:1:1 ratio, one class has a 12:1:1 ratio, and two 
classes of 12:1:4 which are multiply handicapped ranging in age from 5-13 years of age. 

 

177@139 is our elementary inclusion site which currently educates eight students in general education classes with 
supports from our SETSS teacher. 

 

177@190 is our junior high school inclusion site which currently has eight students enrolled in general education 
classes with supports from our SETSS teacher. 

Our students have developed many valuable life skills from their community work site experiences and this has 
enabled them to prepare for work as they articulate out of our school at the age of 21. During the 2016-2017 school 
year, we had initiated two more work sites for students who like to work with our younger population. This entailed 
our students traveling to our 295 site where they taught reading to younger students. The reading lessons were 
prepared for students before they traveled to their work site and students reviewed this lesson prior to visiting their 
work site. This experience heightened their social skills along with their reading scores according to our Sandi and 
Social Skills Assessments. Both sets of students benefited from this curriculum. This plan was so successful last year 
that we feel that the expansion of the program is definitely warranted and will continue into the 2018-2019 school 
year. We continue to foster travel training for those students who may have the ability to maneuver in their 
community and who have learned the appropriate skills needed to travel unsupervised. This is done with the 
assistance of District 75 and the travel training program. Transition is different for each one of our students and it may 
be learning how to travel from one floor to another within the school environment or being able to accept transition 
to another classroom. The school works diligently to ensure all our students are given different opportunities to 
strengthen all of their skills as we strive to make them more independent.  

 

Another aspect of transition is to acquaint and educate our parents/guardians with the tools they need to plan for the 
students as they exit our school at 21. Workshops centered on the “Front Door” policy along with guardianship are 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

continually planned for at our school. We have guest speakers throughout the course of the year inviting 
parents/guardians to come and see the important information being given out. Parent Support Groups also gives our 
parents/guardians time to share information from where you can find doctors/dentists that treat students with 
autism, as well as learning certain behavioral activities on what works for certain parents at home. All of these 
activities make our school very active and are worthwhile for the future of all our students. Last year, we had to 
double the amount of workshops on transition activities due to parent requests. The 2018-2019 school year, we are 
proactively adding several more workshops in the area of transition so that all parents/guardians have ample 
opportunity to attend. We are also educating our parents/guardians as to the different requirements and paperwork 
that is required in order to have a successful articulation out of the Department of Education at their child ages out. 

Our focus last school year was to put greater emphasis on the individual students and how they communicate, 
especially with peers. Do they share with one another and is there discussion between peers? We feel that it is of 
utmost importance for our students to take notice and recognize their peers and in some way acknowledge that they 
have established some form of communication with their peers. This is also part of the Danielson Framework 
component 3C which is emphasized in teacher observations. Students with autism need the motivation to seek out 
people, especially their peers. This is an integral component of the everyday strategies we try to foster with all our 
students. Data from our observations have shown minimal improvement in this area and, as a result, we will continue 
to encourage peer to peer interactions during the upcoming school year. During the upcoming school year, we will 
focus on our cluster teachers' professional development in using the Danielson Framework, especially in the area of 
questioning and discussion techniques during their content area lessons. We will also continue to add aac devices to 
students who we feel can be benefited from their use. We will collaborate with the District 75 Technology Team to 
initiate more screenings for our students. 

177Q continually strives to foster continued collaboration between all aspects of our school community. Our teachers 
meet twice a week for cohort meetings where inquiry and data research are fostered. They are also encouraged to 
attend professional development activities given through District 75 as well as Central DOE. We encourage them to 
turn-key training as much as possible during their cohort meetings, exposing all teachers to what they have learned 
during their professional development. Our parents receive workshops twice monthly (one morning meeting and one 
evening meeting) with guest speakers. We also have a support group where questions and networking become an 
important aspect of our parents/guardians meetings. We provide support group meetings for the siblings of our 
students. During these meetings, youngsters can form relationships with other siblings and discuss topics which may 
be difficult for them to otherwise express with family. This past year, our PTA had voted to incorporate all facets of 
our school community into their organization. From our school safety officers, to our cafeteria workers and our 
custodial staff, they have now joined the PTA making it a collaborative organization whereby all members of the 
school community can participate. It has had a positive impact on our school which will only benefit the students as a 
result. 

Our school continues to provide everyone involved with our students the training and professional development that 
they require in order to have a positive and lasting impact on all our students. From parents/guardians, to our entire 
school staff including paraprofessionals and school aides, we continually seek topics that are of benefit to them in 
educating our students. Open and consistent communication allows us the opportunity to know what we need and 
where we are going. We strive to accommodate and address the needs of as many individuals as we can. Education is 
important for our students as well as all staff, along with our parents/guardians ensuring that our students will receive 
the best overall experience to become independent and productive members of their community. 

 

Research and inquiry continues to play an important role for both our staff as well as for our parents/guardians. We 
continually review data to see what new information and planning strategies we can implement to assist in teaching 
our students. Our 177PTA surveys all of the parents/guardians asking them to identify topics and suggestions for 
upcoming meetings throughout the school year. They too, strive to meet the many needs of all our parents/guardians. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

 

During the 2018-2019 school year, we will focus on having our cluster teachers formulate plans and templates which 
will provide parents/guardians as well as the school community data which impacts on our students learning. Cluster 
teachers will be responsible on how they will take data on their particular content area and be able to provide it to 
whomever may ask to see it. Parents/guardians will also be apprised of all the learning activities associated with our 
cluster periods and how it impacts on the student's iep goals. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

177 has a large student population that is of the transition years. We strive to expose as many students to worksite 
experiences both in school and out in the community at large. This school year (2017-2018) we have established thirty 
seven different work sites where our students experience skills necessary for their future independence. Students 
who are not quite old enough or who have limited work site experience will begin with jobs within the school 
environment. Our different classes of the 6:1, 8:1 and 12:1 populations will begin their work experiences in areas such 
as culinary, school store and cafeteria/custodial work all benefit our students in receiving skills for future 
employment. We are very lucky to have such a receptive community who greet our students and welcome them into 
their working environment. 

 

This year, we will also be focusing attention on our 12:1:4 and 6:1:1 populations at our 295 site. There is a need to 
provide better communication systems for all these students through PECS, AAC devices etc. These all need to be 
incorporated into the daily lessons and routines for these students. Equipment will also be ordered, where necessary, 
for all the new five year olds entering the program. New curriculum will be researched to see what will be the best for 
this new student population entering this site. We also want more homogeneous groupings for all our students at this 
site and teacher collaboration will be used to foster this activity.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

During the 2018-2019 school year, we will continue to focus on our teacher's biweekly teacher team meetings with 
specific agendas and topics that will assist them in data analysis and recognizing remediation activities that will 
challenge their students in reaching higher level academics. We will also strive to develop rubrics that can be utilized 
throughout all subject areas as well as exposing our cluster teachers to the same requirements. Our teacher teams 
will also focus on how we can modify and adapt the common core standards to make them meaningful and important 
for our students and their future independence. Teachers will also be exposed to the new DLM essential elements 
which will assist teachers with following guidelines and activities that are directly related to the skills required for the 
New York State Alternate Assessment. Teachers will have the ability, from added professional development, to link 
SANDI Assessment with NYSAA and to be able to provide meaningful goals for every individual student's IEP. We are 
also going to continue to provide professional development in the area of IEP development and on the importance of 
parent/guardian communication. Our records indicate that through our teach team collaboratives, our students 
performed at higher levels both on our NYSAA and Sandi Assessments from the 2017- 2018 school year! 

 

We will continue to focus attention on acquiring work sites that will interest our students according to their Voc 1 
assessments. We will try to establish work sites in the community that may be of interest to our students and enable 
them to succeed and gain the independence that they want. Travel training from District 75 will once again afford our 
students the ability to navigate and be independent in the community after learning safety procedures from the travel 
trainers. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12 

 

During the 2017-2018 school year, we initiated a behavior committee which provided our teachers with mentoring on 
the writing and initiating of behavior plans for their students. Because of the success of this program we were able to 
de certify five students of their one to one crisis paraprofessionals. 

 

Behavior and behavior plans will continue to be a priority agenda item during the 2018-2019 school year. Our 
teachers need assistance in developing comprehensive plans that will ensure student success in their classrooms. We 
plan to have a behavioral intervention teacher join the IEP team in developing plans with our teachers in order to 
develop a more cohesive plan for our students. We want to make sure that all plans are followed consistently, 
especially with our classroom teams. Paraprofessionals will be given extensive training in taking data and how to 
record it. Ongoing checking of data will be seen by our behavior committee and guidance counselors. 

 

As we begin the 2018-2019 school year, we will have teacher teams adapt and modify the common core standards to 
meet their students' needs and focus on the independent and functional skills the students will need to be a part of 
their communities in the near future. Functional academics are an essential component to our students learning. 
Achieving high standards as well as applying modifications are balanced throughout our school environment and will 
continue to be something every class is challenged to do. We will also concentrate on the linking of the Essential 
Elements to Sandi while utilizing these programs to formulate IEP goals. We will be participating in several pilot 
programs to increase linkage to IEP goals and assessments especially in the initiation of math and ela goals. 

During the 2017-2018 school year, the school administration worked together with the PTA in developing workshops 
that assisted our parents/guardians in the home as well as learning about the different assessments utilized by the 
school. We had a five percent increase in parent participation during the morning meetings of the PTA. 

It is imperative that we continue to provide workshops and assist our parents/guardians during the 2018-2019 school 
year especially in attending the Front Door Workshops. Our parent coordinator will reach out to our families and 
guardians whose children are beginning their transition years. Informing them early will make things much easier for 
them so that all things are in place before the mandated age of 21 years old. We will also be initiating Voc Assessment 
and transition templates in grades K-2, 3-5 and follow up into the high school years. These will assist in having our 
parents/guardians plan for their child's future as early as possible and with knowing what has to be completed by 
certain ages. We will also survey our parents/guardians as to what type of workshops they would find helpful in 
assisting them with their children in the home environment. We will work closely with our PTA in the planning of 
these workshops as well as our Parent Support Group to ensure that we supply as many workshops as possible for all 
of our families.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
During the 2017-2018 school year, we focused on improving writing skills for all our 8:1 and 12:1 students. A review of 
student progress has shown an increase in writing abilities according to our Sandi Assessment for these students. This 
year, we would like to focus on our youngest students in the 6:1:1 population by having them initiate writing skills 
whether through pictures or actual drawing or writing skills. Homeroom teachers as well as cluster teachers in the 
areas of literacy, and library will assist in the development of these skills. Professional development from District 75 as 
well as educational consultants will also be provided.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, all 6:1 students ages 5-8 will demonstrate a 5% increase in writing skills from September baseline as 
compared to the Spring (June 2019) SANDI Assessment results.

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
Homeroom teachers will reach out to parents/guardians encouraging them to see what their child is doing in class. 
Homework exercises will be reinforced for our students enabling our parents/guardians to give them support in the 
home environment. We will encourage Parent/guardian visitation to classroom and computer class to view the 
lessons being taught. This will be done twice a semester. Homeroom teachers will also provide activities for 
parents/guardians to utilize at home which will strengthen the classroom instruction. Parent/teacher conferences 
twice a year will provide a showcase of work that is being done in their child's homeroom. Book publishing and 
portfolio celebration at the end of the 2018-2019 school year will allow our parents to see what has been 
accomplished by our students.

school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Through observations of the past school year, the administration has noted inconsistency of practices being taught by 
homeroom teachers and cluster teachers. Our curriculum committee works diligently In initiating units of study for 
our school but there seems to be a lack of these units being followed up in our cluster activities. It is the 
administration's recommendation that we provide more collaboration between homeroom teachers and their classes 
cluster teachers in order that our students are provided more curriculum consistency throughout the 2018-2019 
school year. We have also seen a lack of communication between cluster teachers and our parents/guardians. During 
the new school year, we hope to see an increase of parent/guardian communication with our cluster teachers so that 
parents/guardians can become acquainted with what is being taught and the data being taken in our student's cluster 
classes. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 

  By June 2019, students will demonstrate a 5% increase on ELA scores on the Sandi/Fast when compared to 

their fall baseline scores as a result of our school wide emphasis on ELA instruction during cluster period 
instruction.

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Many of our teachers recognize the need for our students to be able to communicate. For our multiply disabled 
students it is even of greater importance for those students to have some way of communicating especially 
concerning their wants and needs. Communication is also a contributor to behavior for all our students and when our 
students become frustrated or something is wrong, these students in particular have a difficult time in expressing 
themselves. During administrative walk throughs, we have observed many of our multiply disabled students having 
missed opportunities for communication with their teachers and peers. Although the majority of these students 
receive speech services, we have little or minimal follow up with our teachers in implementing communication 
systems for all these students. We are now concentrating on professional development activities for all our staff in 
the 12:1:4 classrooms as well as having specific cohort meeting with homeroom teachers and speech teachers in 
developing communication systems for each individual student in the 12:1:4 classrooms. The school will also purchase 
added speech devices that are relevant to this population as well. Speech will collaborate with homeroom teachers in 
developing the most suitable plan for communication for each student.  

This year, according to my MOLP, we will develop and initiate leveled reading groups and math groups throughout the 
site. Students will transition to different classrooms for these periods so that groups are geared more to their levels. 
Peer to peer engagement will also be stressed whereby some students can work together together on problems and 
activities promoting more communication and engagement between them. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, we will improve strategies for increased communication systems for our 12:1:4 population as well as our 
6:1:1 populations at our 295 site. We will show a 5% increase of communication skills from the baseline score of the 
Sandi Assessment in September 2018 as compared to Sandi Assessment results in June 2019 in communication skills. 
Speech assessments as well as administrative walk throughs and parent/teacher conferences will increase our students 
skills.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In order to continue to emphasize the need for participation in the process of transition planning for all our students, 
we will continue to provide to parents/guardians and our students the opportunity to participate in transition 
planning as well as providing sequential steps as what needs to be in place before a student reaches 21 years of age. 
Very often many of our parents/guardians along with our students are unprepared as they articulate out of the DOE. 
We have reached out to our community businesses, enabling us to have 37 work sites for our students. Paperwork 
continues to be the biggest impediment for our students as they begin their new future in the outside community. 
Our Parents/guardians do not attend the Front Door workshops and receive the guidance from our transition 
coordinator as to how to make the best possible solutions for our students as they turn 21 years of age. Our school 
works closely with OMRDD and Access VR to ensure job placement for our students who have trained successfully in 
our work site programs. The common deterrent to this is very often our students have not been able to complete the 
Front Door Policy initiated by the state due to lack of parent involvement. We continue to reach out to all of our 
parents/guardians as well as the case managers for our students inviting them to participate in the many workshops, 
planning meetings as well as individual guidance on what needs to be done in order to prepare for the future of each 
of our students as they turn 21 years of age. During the 2017-2018 school year, we showed an increase in parent 
involvement and one good note is that our parents/guardians are starting the transition process much earlier then 
ever before, giving our students a better chance in the community and future settings. We will be having our 
parents/guardians fill out state vocational templates starting in kindergarten and following up with new templates 
every three years. Hopefully, teachers will be able to conduct these interviews with parents/guardians during open 
school day/week as well as visitation days throughout the school year. Transition should begin as early as the students 
enter our organization and will be followed up as the students move up the continuum. We will continue to alert 
parents/guardians as to when "Front Door" Workshops are being given and how imperative it is for them to attend. 
Parents/guardians will also be informed of our guardianship meetings and the importance of gaining guardianship 
when our students turn eighteen years of age.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
 

By June 2019, there will be an additional 5% increase in parental/guardian involvement in student transition planning as 
evidenced by overall parent/guardian attendance in transition workshops, IEP meetings, and parent support groups 
along with tours of future placements as compared to the 2017-2018 school year. Overall, we would like to see a gain of 
5% attendance at all parent/family functions throughout the school year including family fun night, PTA meetings and 
Parent Support Group Meetings along with a variety of different workshops being offered to our parents. Our Transition

Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website:

When a student's address is changed, we immediately notify OPT and our District 75 Placement Office. We afford the 
parent/guardian the opportunity to stay in our school or move to a closer school while they are in temporary housing. 
Quite often our parents/guardians wish to continue in our school in order to provide the consistency to their child. 
Our parent coordinator also reaches out to our parents/guardians to inform them of their rights while living in 
temporary housing as well as offering our services to help make this transition easier for them. We also supply our 
students with necessary school supplies etc. to assist the family in keeping communication between school and home 
as consistent as possible. Our school also supplies kits to families in temporary housing to accommodate some of their 
needs. Posted on the first floor hallway in our school, we have McKinney-Vento posters placed in strategic locations 
for all of our families to view as well as who to contact if they are in need of assistance. 

 

3. Some Non-Title I schools receive a specific allocation based on the reported number of students living in temporary 
housing.  If your school received an allocation (please refer to the current Title I Funds Summary of School Allocation 
Memorandum), include the amount your school received in this question.  If your school did not receive an allocation 
and needs assistance in identifying resources to assist STH students, please contact an STH liaison. 

Last year, our school received funding for all of our students living in temporary housing. With the money received, 
we purchased specific kits for our students to take home which included back packs, hygiene products and extra 
school supplies such as markers, books and workbooks for them to utilize in their new housing. We received a total of 
$1500 to be used for this purpose.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P177Q, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

P177Q will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

There are 496 students with special needs at PS177Q. The ethnic breakdown of our student 
population is as follows: 21.12% Hispanic; 1.81% American Indian/Alaskan; 19.91% Asian; 
1.81% Hawaiian/Pacific Islander; 31.38% Black; 23.34% White; and 0.60% are Multi-
Racial.  During the 2018-2019 school year, 23.99% of the student populations have been 
identified as ELLs.  One hundred and nineteen English Language Learners were identified as 
entitled to the Free Standing ENL Program at P177Q and 13 students are serviced through their 
IEP and tested with the NYSESLAT. The home languages for our ELLs include: Arabic, Urdu, 
Farsi, Hindi, Tadzhik, Nepali, Bengali, Cantonese, Greek, Haitian Creole, Korean, Mandarin, 
Polish, Punjabi, Russian, and Spanish. Alternate Grade Level indicators (AGLI) are used to 
assess students' performance on required components of the Core Curricula for English 
Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies, as charted on the blueprints. 
Currently, all instructional programs address these areas of learning for NYSAA-eligible 
students. Curriculum content, materials and text are simplified to less complex forms, yet remain 
age appropriate. Every attempt is made to align the same main ideas being addressed by same 
aged peers at that grade level. The New York State Alternate Assessment (NYSAA) is a data 
folio style assessment in which students with severe cognitive disabilities demonstrate their 
performance toward achieving the New York State Learning Standards.                   
 In addition to the NYSESLAT, all students are assessed with the Student Annual Needs 
Determination Inventory (SANDI). The purpose of the SANDI is to track students' progress 
throughout the school year. Subsequently, students are assessed with the SANDI assessment 
once in the fall and once in the spring. The results of the SANDI will be used to develop IEP 
process goals that are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. The teachers' data 
collecting process begins with the SANDI assessment, to IEP goals and end with appropriate 
lesson plan development to best meet the needs of individual students. The patterns from 
assessment data indicate that an emphasis on visuals must be utilized as a primary educational 
teaching methodology. Additionally, the ENL teachers incorporate other teaching methodologies 
which include: Language Experience, Whole Language and Cooperative Learning, in 
conjunction with Augmentative Communication Devices and learning with Pictorial Symbolic 
Representation, visual and graphic organizers and multi-sensory and multicultural ENL materials 
which are infused throughout all aspects of instruction. Our emphasis on improving students' 
academic language, involve assessing students and providing access to instruction with rigorous 
academic content in all subject areas. The following research based programs such 
as:  Sandi/FAST assessments, Attainment Math, Getting Ready to Learn, and the Unique 
Learning System Curriculum are utilized to support and facilitate academic rigor for our ELL 
student population. Additionally, ELLs are supported and encouraged to participate in all extra-
curricular activities which include: Debate, Student Council, School Newspaper, Band and other 
planned school wide social events. Ensuring equal access to extra-curricular and academic 
programs helps our ELLs to acquire proficiency in the English Language. 
P177Q has planned a Title III Program for our English Language Learners (ELLs).  This 
program will run from October through March.  It will be on Tuesdays from 3pm-6pm.  This 
program will run at the same time as the Middle School-After School program,  The supervisor

of that program will also supervise the Title III program and will not be compensated through 
Title III funds.  This program will be staffed by two certified ENL teachers and two 
paraprofessionals that will assist with the academic and language needs of the students.  The 
majority of students receiving ELL services at P177Q are students with mild and significant 
cognitive delays, some who are verbal and others who are non-verbal. All students require 
specially designed instruction to meet their learning need. The supplemental instructional 
program will serve 20 High School students with mild or significant intellectual disabilities who 
all scored Emerging through Transitioning on the Spring 2017 NYSESLAT. Included in this 
group are students with 12:1:1 and 8:1:1 ratios on their IEPs.  Two paraprofessionals are needed 
to be in compliance with the student's IEPs. A Speech teacher will be included to help facilitate 
conversation and communication between the students. The program will focus on increasing 
English Language acquisition , communication skills as well as the social and emotional 
growth among our adolescent ELL student population. In order to reach our ELL student 
population, we will provide our ELLs with an afterschool program connected to the NYC STEM 
Framework. 
This curriculum introduces powerful ideas from engineering in a structured, developmentally 
appropriate way. The powerful ideas from engineering addressed in this curriculum include: the 
engineering design process, robotics, programming, repeat parameters, and sensors. These 
powerful ideas are explored in the context of a curriculum that draws on the theme of the 
playground and can be adapted to many other themes. Each unit follows the same basic structure: 
1) warm up games to playfully introduce or reinforce concepts, 2) introduction of the powerful 
idea through a challenge, 3) work individually or in pairs, 4) technology circle, 5) free-
explorations, and 6) student’s assessment. We will adapt the lesson structure and its components 
to suit the student’s needs. 
The curriculum unit is designed to take place after school on Tuesdays over the course of 15 
intensive weeks of work. Each session will last 3 hours. Some classes or students may benefit 
from further division of the activities into smaller steps or from more time to explore each new 
concept before moving onto the next, either in the context of free-exploration or with teacher-
design challenges. The activities provide an introduction to each concept. For instance, students 
could explore a range of different activities and challenges with sensors to learn how they work 
in more depth. 
To supplement the structured challenges, free-exploration will be allotted throughout the 
curriculum. These open-ended sessions are vital for children to fully understand the complex 
ideas going on with their engineering creations and programs. The free-exploration sessions also 
serve as a time for teachers to observe students’ progress and understandings. These sessions are 
as important for learning as the lessons themselves! Free-exploration provides opportunities for 
playing with materials and ideas. This will help build a solid foundation. 
This curriculum engages young learners in: 
 1. Content creation, by engaging children in making a robotic artifact and in programming its 
behaviors. The engineering design process of building and the computational thinking involved 
in programming fosters competence in computer literacy and technological fluency. The use of 
design journals make transparent to the children themselves, as well as teachers and parents, their 
own thinking, their learning trajectories and the project’s evolution over time. The design 
process, like the scientific method, gives students a tool for systematically addressing a problem 
or need. Some children need constraints and top-down planning. Others enjoy working bottom-
up and messing around with the materials to come up with ideas. Both learning styles are 
conducive for building competence in the technological domain and are welcomed and respected 
in this robotics program by providing different kinds of design journals explicitly designed to 
encourage differentiated instruction. 
2. Creativity, this curriculum promotes creativity by fostering opportunities for children to 
develop their own project ideas, as opposed to copy them from a booklet or follow instructions, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
and by providing different materials for children to work with. As children approach solving 
technical problems in creative ways, they develop a sense of confidence in their learning 
potential. The Participatory Technology Development(PTD) approach of working with robotics 
is based on the promotion of creativity, as opposed to efficiency, in problem solving. The 
original meaning of the term engineering, which derives from the Latin ingenium, means “innate 
quality, mental power, clever invention”. However, clever or creative projects are difficult to 
make and the process can be frustrating. Our approach aims at helping children to learn how to 
manage frustration. Teachers will also schedule in “breaks” during long building and 
programming periods if the class is growing frustrated and bring everyone together to reinforce 
concepts and troubleshoot problems. Learning how to manage frustration is also associated with 
the development of confidence. As children go through this program they slowly realize their 
ability to find solutions, either by trying multiple times, by using different strategies or by asking 
for help. This is an important aspect of emotional development. 
 3. Collaboration, by engaging children in a learning environment that promotes working in 
teams, sharing resources and caring about each other.  At the beginning of each session, each 
child receives, along with their design journal, a personalized printout with his or her photograph 
in the center of the page and the photographs and names of all other children in the class 
arranged in a circle surrounding that central photo. Throughout the session, at the teacher’s 
prompting, each child draws a line from his or her own photo to the photos of the children with 
whom he or she has collaborated. Collaboration is defined here as getting or giving help with a 
project, programming together, lending or borrowing materials, or working together on a 
common task. At the end of the session, children write or draw “thank you cards” to the children 
with whom they have collaborated the most. 
 4. Communication, through mechanisms that promote a sense of connection between peers or 
with adults. One of the ways this program engages students in communication is through 
technology circles - a time for all, children and adults, to stop their work, put their projects on the 
table or floor, sit down in a circle together, and share the state of their projects. Technology 
circles present a good opportunity for problem solving as a community. Technology circles can 
be called as often as every twenty minutes at the beginning of a project, or only once at the end 
of a day of work, depending on the needs of the children and the need of the teacher to introduce 
new concepts . 
5. Community-building, through scaffolded opportunities to form a learning community that 
promotes contribution of ideas. The long term goal of this robotics program is not only to foster 
STEM thinking  amongst the participating children and teachers, but also amongst the wider 
community. Public displays of the learning process serve a dual function: to make learning 
visible to others and to the children themselves. In this spirit, final projects are shown to parents, 
friends and community members in the form of open houses. During these open houses, parents, 
siblings, and other family members visit the class for a demonstration of the children’s final 
projects. 
The language of instruction will be in English by 2 certified ENL teachers with two bilingual 
paraprofessionals providing native language support.  1 Speech Therapist will also provide 
support to program participants during the latter half of the program.   Specifically, the purpose 
of the Speech Therapist is to integrate and facilitate  Peer-Mediated instruction.  The program 
will use engineering model kits and curriculum resources from K’Nex Education and 
Lego Education. We purchased Lego sets and K'nex sets last year and the previous year.  They 
are not consumable, so this year we would like to upgrade our Lego program to include more 
programmable Lego projects. We also want to purchase 2 more sets of WeDo 2.0 Legos and 3 
EV3 core sets with chargers that can be used with the new iPads. We will also incorporate JAM 
wellness tools into our Title III program. This is needed as a component in our program because 
the students work better and learn better when physical activity is woven into their program.

As awareness of the childhood obesity crisis spreads, we recognize the importance of providing 
higher-quality, more nutritious food, and of re-integrating physical activity back into students’ 
daily routines. Just-a-Minute(JAM) resources offer simple, fun, energetic fitness routines and 
healthier living tips that people of all ages and abilities can confidently participate in and use. 
JAM routines are quick, simple fitness routine that includes 5 easy exercises that kids (and staff) 
can do while either standing at their desk or sitting in a chair. Included on each issue is a health 
tip, something simple that teaches a healthier habit. Routines are authored by JAM experts.

K'Nex workshops are designed to demonstrate the ways the machine sets can be used in the classroom, while 
at the same time giving educators the opportunity to experience the excitement their students will feel when 
using K'NEX to learn science, math, and technology concepts. 
Along with the K’Nex and Lego professionals the ENL teachers will provide professional development for 
staff of the Title III Program. The Title III After School Professional Development Program will run at 
various intervals throughout the program from 3:00PM to 4:30PM on Wednesday's.  The professional 
development will be ongoing throughout the program.  Two sessions will occur prior to starting the program, 
one will be in the middle to review the upcoming projects and the last two will be near the end to review and 
evaluate the students' progress. The overall focus of the workshops is as follows:  How to deliver the 
curriculum in an engaging way, the STEM building projects, the use of the collaboration map and the use of 
the journal to enhance their writing skills.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Begin description here:            
Communication with families of the students serviced through Title III funds will be ongoing 
throughout the school year.  Parental involvement will involve workshops, questionnaires, and 
the opportunity to participate in the Title III program.  Parents of the Title III ELL students will 
be invited to an orientation meeting September 28th where we will explain the program and they 
will also be invited to attend the final workshop in the program.  Language interpretation 
services will be provided by the Bilingual paraprofessionals who are working in the Title III 
program.  
Translated Title III letters, memorandums, and brochures will be sent home to parents via the 
U.S. Postal service, as well as in the students’ backpacks.  Staff is available for 
translation/interpretation if needed and all communication will be translated for families for 
whom English is not the primary language in the home.  The parent coordinator and one of the 
guidance counselors will develop resources, as well as provide workshops during the school year 
that target the needs of our population.  Many of our ELL parents are unfamiliar with the 
workings of agencies which can assist them with transition and after-school care. Since the 
workshops entail practical applications for daily living, we believe that our ELL parents will 
begin to have an understanding of how our government/social agencies work. The workshops 
will be scheduled on selected dates, one day per month (from 9AM-11AM), starting in October 
through the school year and will be done by the Parent Coordinator and Guidance counselor at 
no additional cost to the Title III funds.  The planned programs will include the following topics: 
Developing Independence Skills-travel training, “Front Door”-how does it work, Future 
planning/Guardianship, Improving Sleep, Challenging Behaviors, the Transition Process, 
Alternative Therapies, CPR, and Speech and Communication.  Parents will also be invited to 
participate with the students during the last Title III session in March.  An outside agency will 
facilitate a workshop on post-secondary planning for their children.  This session will run 
concurrently with the students LEGO program.  The parents will also have a chance to see their 
children building the projects and will be given a photo book of their child's experiences from 
the workshop series. This will give them exposure to the topics that the students have been 
working on for the past 14 weeks.  The students will present their journal experiences and 
describe/demonstrate how to build their favorite machine.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The Students Annual Needs Determination Inventory (SANDI) and the Formative Assessment of Standards Tasks (FAST) are 
formative assessments that are used to monitor the progress of Ells towards meeting their learning goals. Curriculum-
embedded assessments are also used to evaluate the academic needs and development of Ells  within the classroom. 
Curriculum-embedded assessments include:  Assessments in the Failure-Free and Myon Reading Programs; On-going data 
collection in the Attainment Math Program, Monthly assessments in the Unique Learning System; teacher created 
assessments; teacher observations; rubrics and students' self-assessments are some of the  assessment tools that are currently 
utilized to guide the instructional planning of our Ells. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The formative assessment process is a critical component in designing individualized instruction for all students, but 
particularly for our ELLs. Subsequently, teachers begin the school year by assessing students with the  SANDI and FAST 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

 

assessment tools. Results are analyzed with the SANDI Instructional Planning  Protocol, which helps teachers create and 
implement specially designed instruction, that addresses students' strengths and needs. The use of SANDI and FAST as 
formative assessment tools guide teachers in making decisions about future instruction for our ELLs.  Additional formative 
assessment strategies that are utilized to evaluate the academic needs of ELLS throughout the day include:  Multiple 
opportunities for students to engage in question/answer classroom discussions;  documentation of teacher observations; 
teacher made assessments; rubrics and students' self-assessments. Many of the academic programs that are used across all 
classrooms have curriculum-embedded formative assessments. For example, the Failure Free Reading Program, which has a 
placement test that determines the appropriate reading level for our ELLs. This program also provides multiple opportunities 
for follow up questions on text read. Similarly, the Myon Reading Program, also has a placement test which allows students to 
select texts from recommended levels. Teacher observations and data collection occur regularly through questioning, as well 
as informal comprehension assessments.  Teachers also utilize the Attainment Math Program to monitor  IEP  goals in the area 
of Mathematics for our ELLs.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 The summative assessments that are utilized consist of the SANDI (Students' Assessment Needs Determination Inventory); 
NYSAA (New York State Alternate Assessment); ULS  (Unique Learning System) and the NYSESLAT. The aforementioned 
summative assessments provide reliable data on baseline, progress monitoring and areas of needs for our ELLs. Each 
assessment support teachers in measuring students; mastery of learning.       
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 Once school-wide summative data has been gathered and analyzed, programs and curriculum based decisions are made by 
the administrative team. However, In order to create individualized instruction and small learning groups on the classroom 
level, assessment teams analyze the proficiency levels and need areas for individual students.  Skill areas that have been 
identified as below proficiency on the SANDI assessment are  prioritized.  Those skills that the assessment team have identified 
as priority areas, are then flagged as an IEP goal. Smart IEP goals are written and the three licensed ENL providers support 
teachers with appropriate academic interventions and materials for our ELLs. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
For the core of our students we provide a rigorous and evidence-based curriculum, including English language development for 
ELLs. For those ELLs that need extra attention we provide additional targeted research-based instruction. We tailor a rigorous 
and individualized intervention (small group or 1:1) for those ELLs that need more intensive support. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data patterns across proficiency levels reveal that our students are steadily improving year over year in speaking and 
listening modalities. We hope to show greater improvement in reading using our new reading programs which are currently 
being piloted.    
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 
In order to make adjustments to our academic programs, assessment teams analyze and report data from outcome 
assessments. During the Fall Parent Teacher Conferences,, before and during all scheduled IEP meetings, assessment data  is 
shared with all in attendance.  A summary statement of students'' assessment results are also noted in the students' Present 
Level of Performance portion of the IEP.  Students' finalized ' IEPs are accessible by all staff who provide support to students, 
and parents receive continuous updates on outcome assessments.

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Freestanding ENL Programs provide instruction in English with home language support, emphasizing English language 
acquisition. Students in freestanding ENL programs come from many different language backgrounds, and English is 
often the only common language among the students. As part of the new CR Part 154 all ELLs will receive a specified 
amount of standalone ENL and integrated ENL instruction. Stand-alone ENL is an ENL class for Entering and Emerging 
ELLs.  The students will receive instruction to develop English language skills so that the students can succeed in 
the core content courses. It will be delivered by a certified ENL instructor.  Stand-Alone ENL is typically held in the 
back of the ENL student's classroom with the ENL teacher and ELL students in a small group, as space is at a premium 
in our building.  Students are not taken out of core classes to receive Stand-Alone ENL.  Integrated ENL instruction is 
used to build English language skills through content instruction and will be delivered through co-teaching by an ENL 
teacher and content area teacher. The three ENL teachers will work closely with the classroom teachers to provide 
language supports during classroom instruction. The ENL minutes each student receives will be dictated by their 
proficiency level and grade level. All groups are heterogeneously grouped based on the student's IEP ratio and grade 
level. All of our students are in self-contained ungraded special education classes as determined by their IEP.    

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

At this time, our school does not offer a TBE/DL program 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

At this time, our school does not offer a TBE/DL program 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           We have three licensed ENL teachers who provide instruction to our ELLs through the standalone and integrated models 
of ENL instruction. Often students are pulled out of one class and pushed into another class to receive their ENL instruction. 
Our students are grouped by age, IEP ratio, and proficiency level.  Half of the instructional time is spent on ELA and the rest of 
the time is spent in the various content areas. Throughout the year the ENL teachers collaborate with the classroom teachers 
in Cohorts that meet twice a week. The Cohorts are used to provide opportunities for staff development, as well as a common 
planning time for all teachers.  HLA is supported by a bilingual paraprofessional during content area instruction. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   The content areas of math, ELA and science are delivered using both the integrated and standalone models. All instruction is 
in English with support from bilingual paraprofessionals who speak Chinese, Spanish and Haitian Creole when needed. We 
have found that hands on learning works best with our special needs population and because of that the methodology we find 
most effective is TPR (Total Physical Response). This language-teaching method is based on the coordination of language and 
physical movement. Our primary focus in lessons is on meaning which distinguishes TPR from other grammar-based methods 
such as grammar-translation. This approach makes content comprehensible to foster language development, and meets the 
demands of the CCLS.  We also use a content based reading program called UNIQUE that provides differentiated instruction for 
our students with picture support. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

  We ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year by using alternate 
placement/bilingual paraprofessionals to assess them via teacher-made assessments.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

We provide all ELL subgroups with the opportunity to achieve English language proficiency by using intensive small group 
instruction and individualized instruction. This differentiation is driven by many factors such as student’s age, English language 
proficiency, native language, disability, and IEP ratio. Alternate placement paraprofessionals are provided to those students 
who have been deemed needing bilingual instruction on their IEP. We have many interventions available at P177Q for our ELLs 
including; 1:1 supports for newcomers and long-term ELLs, a twelve month school year for all ELLs, the UNIQUE learning 
system for our developing ELLs, scaffolded lessons and graphic organizers for our former ELLs and SIFE students, and multi-
sensory approaches and The Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) for our  students who the require the 
support.  Some of our students also have communication devices (as per their IEPs) such as Voice Output 
Communication(VOC) Devices and iPads with icons or text that enable our ELLs, who are non-verbal, to speak. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 Unique Learning Systems is the key grade level curriculum that our teachers of ELL-SWDs use to provide ELL-SWDs access to 
academic content areas of science, social studies, and math, and to accelerate English language development in these areas. 
Unique Learning System is an online, interactive, standards-based curriculum specifically designed for students with special 
needs. Teachers download and interact with monthly, instructional, thematic units of study. Each unit contains lesson plans 
with curriculum adaptations and interactive materials teachers can implement into classroom learning activities. Additionally, 
real world, Community Based Instruction (CBI) is integrated throughout and across all content areas.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The entire curriculum of self contained special needs school was developed in order to accommodate our SWD’s and our ELL 
SWD’s are included in this. We offer varied instructional and scheduling flexibility to help our students achieve their IEP goals 
and English proficiency goals in the least restrictive environment. We offer both push in and pull out models of instruction, one 
to one instruction, differentiated grouping, and collaborative team teaching with Physical Therapists, Occupational Therapists, 
speech therapists, counseling, paraprofessionals, and ENL teachers to help accommodate our students. Finally, ELL's 
participate in a variety extra-curricular activities, such as: Band; Basketball; Theatre and in our After-School Program. The rich 
academics and extra-curricular programs enable our ELL's the opportunity to achieve their IEP goals and to attain language 
proficiency.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The IEP provides the best opportunity for parents, educators and therapists to identify and target specific goals, approaches, 
and interventions for our ELLs. These goals are targeted beyond each specific ELL sub group and are targeted to the need of 
each individual student.  Unique Learning Systems is a key grade level material that we use to provide access to academic 
content areas of science and social studies and to accelerate English language development in these areas. We have a team of 
dedicated math, science and literacy coaches to support ELLs academically in core content areas.  The ELLs who are at the 
Entering and Emerging stages of English language development are supported further with content based stories in the 
MYon reading program and the Attainment Math program.  Those students who are at the Transitioning and Expanding levels 
have access to these programs and they are offered additional supports with the Scholastic News Magazine and the Failure 
Free reading program.  All instruction is IEP driven and all students are reassessed using the SANDI so that their yearly goals 
can be adjusted as they progress.  The language of instruction is English, but if a student needs assistance in their home 
language then a paraprofessional who speaks their language will be called upon to assist the student. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Based on an analysis of 2016-2017 SANDI Communication sub-test, there has been moderate progress among our ELLs on the 
high school level. Subsequently, participation of ELLs on the Debate Team will be increased. Recruitment efforts will be 
undertaken by the ENL teachers during the school year. Another program that will be expanded is the Fletcher's Place Reading 
Program.  This program was implemented in the fall of 2016-2017 school year and is currently utilized in two elementary 
classes at the off-site-177Q@295.  The program teaches reading through phonics with  a multi-sensory 
approach.  Implementation of the program, incorporated peer to peer teaching. High school age students from the main site 
facilitated the Fletcher's Place Reading Program in two of the 6:1:1 elementary age classes at 177Q@295.  The program was so 
successful, that it will also be implemented at the main site.  Additionally, our dually certified Special Education and TESOL 
teacher, will  provide instruction to approximately eighty ELLs in the area of positive behaviors and social skills building. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

No programs or services for ELLs will be discontinued in the upcoming year.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs. We offer a rigorous academic program as well as a host of extra-
curricular activities for all of our students. Students can be involved with sports teams, the school newspaper, student council, 
band and debate. Our ENL teachers inform our ELLs about all extra-curricular activities and all ELLs are encouraged to 
participate. Ensuring equal access to all school programs helps our students acquire English language proficiency.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The Unique Learning System and IPads are currently used to support ELLs. We also use teacher-made materials, adapted 
books, manipulatives, computers, and smart boards.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

The student’s and parent’s home language is listed on each student’s IEP. Translation is provided by a paraprofessional or an 
outside contracted provider if necessary.  If they student needs language support in their native language, a bilingual 
paraprofessional will be provided for that student. In addition, teachers can group students of the same language for certain 
activities so that they can assist each other and respond in their home language. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The school ensures that all required services are provided and that all services and supports are age/grade appropriate.  This is 
done through teacher observations and cohort group meetings with cooperating teachers.  Time is allotted during the school 
day, once or twice a week, for the ENL teachers and the classroom teachers of the ENL students to meet and discuss the areas 
of instruction and levels of work the students need.  We make sure that all of our content is appropriate for the age and ability 
level of each of our students. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
The Unique Learning System and IPads are currently used to support ELLs. We also use teacher-made materials, adapted 
books, manipulatives, computers, and smart boards.   
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
A program that assists our newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year is our summer school program.  It must 
be on their IEP and they will be placed in a smaller class so that they can have more support initially while they assimilate into 
our diverse school population.  One of the school’s guidance counselors will pick up the student, either individually or in a 
group (as per their IEP) to help them assimilate and get used to our school environment.  Our parent coordinator will also 
welcome the student and their family and make sure they are aware of outside programs and services that they can apply for 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

 

to better help their child function in school and society. If the parent needs an afterschool or Saturday program, our parent 
coordinator is able to put them in touch with the proper agencies that can assist the family in getting the services they need. 
Similarly, during the school year our new ENL students are afforded the same programs and services.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Language electives are not offered at our school because all of our students are exempt from this requirement.  We are a D75 
IEP driven school. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A-There are  no Dual Language programs offered at our school.   
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The professional development requirements for the upcoming school year are as follows: 15% of the total hours will be ELL-
specific PD for all teachers and 50% of the total hours will be ELL-specific PD for Bilingual Education and ENL teachers.  This will 
be accomplished through PD days for newer classroom teachers and Compliance Meetings for the ENL teachers. We will 
accomplish this during our cohort meetings and school-wide staff development days, as well as attending District 75 staff 
development trainings given throughout the school year. Staff development days for the 2017-2018 school year will be held on 
September 5, November 7, and June 7. Professional development that is offered at the district level will include other PD 
workshops given by the D75 ENL Coaches in regard to best practices for co-teaching and integrating language and content 
instruction for ELLs, as well as workshops for ENL teachers that are dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with core 
content area instruction.  The two ENL teachers will also provide substantial and sustained opportunities for all teachers to 
participate in meaningful professional development that addresses the needs of ELLs, including home and new language 
development. This will create intentional learning opportunities for all teachers to collaborate and design instruction, analyze 
student work, and develop rigorous lessons. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 Professional development that is offered at the district level will include other PD workshops given by the D75 ENL Coaches in 
regard to best practices for co-teaching and integrating language and content instruction for ELLs, as well as workshops for ENL 
teachers that are dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction.  The three ENL teachers 
will also provide substantial and sustained opportunities for all teachers to participate in meaningful professional development 
that addresses the needs of ELLs, including home and new language development. This will create intentional learning 
opportunities for all teachers and support staff to collaborate and design instruction, analyze student work, and develop 
rigorous lessons.   Agendas and attendance sheets from ELL-specific meetings will be kept on file at the school.  This will show 
the break down in content specific topics to show that the 15% and 50% of the hours needed have been addressed.  The ENL 
teachers will keep copies of the agendas of the PDs that they attend that are given by the D75 ENL coaches.  This will provide 
the evidence of our professional development opportunities.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Through the school’s PTA, Parent Coordinator and Guidance Department, P177Q will offer parents/guardians of ELLs ongoing 
information and training in different aspects of their children’s education.  All training and information will be sent home 
and/or presented using the preferred language of the parent or guardian.  The parents are also invited to meet with the school 
staff at their convenience during the school day.  At these meetings (usually at the IEP meeting) the student’s language 
proficiency assessment results and language development needs in all content areas are discussed.  The ENL teacher will also 
discuss the SANDI and NYSESLAT results and the implications that drive instruction for the ELL students.  Additional meetings 
will be scheduled throughout the year, usually in the late fall and spring once the SANDI testing is completed. The student’s 
speech teacher, if applicable, is also present at these meetings.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

These are some of the activities that foster parental involvement in our school for our ELL parents:

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Kathleen Posa, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Home language identification (HLS) surveys and ATS reports (RHLA and RYOS) are used to determine the home 
language of all English Language Learners in the school. Parents indicate on the blue contact student emergency 
card what language they would like used when the school contacts the home. From the ATS reports and survey 
information, we are able to ascertain when translation and interpretation needs are required. Teachers and 
bilingual staff will assist in translation and interpretation of needs. Translated documents are generated from NYS 
DOE translation services. Finally, notices describing the translation services are posted at the front door.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In the event of a school emergency we will use the DOE's over-the phone translation services to inform the parents of 
an emergency. This will be in the form of a 3-way call with the translator on the line. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Our school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor's Regulation A-663 by disseminating 
the document and by utilizing our teachers' of ELLs to provide staff with support throughout the year. At the opening 
meeting in September administration will distribute a copy of Chancellor's Regulation A-663 and teachers of ELLs with 
administration will provide staff with a verbal summary of Chancellor's Regulation A-663. An on-line version of the 
document will also remain on the school's server. Finally, at the main entrance of our school., a sign in each of the 
most prominent languages is posted to inform parents about the availability of interpretation services.

Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

P177Q will post a sign for translation an interpretation services in the appropriate languages. Parent's Bill of Rights in 
DOE translated languages is available at the security desk and in the parent coordinator's office. 
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

At the beginning of each school year, parents of students who receive ENL services will be sent a survey in September 
and June. The needs assessment survey will provide parents of ELL's with the opportunity to have input on programs 
and workshop topics. Additionally, parents will rate the services received during the previous school year. The data 
collected from the survey will be analyzed for next steps in program planning and services for our ELL's and their 
families.
