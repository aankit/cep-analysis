Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

P.S. 372 The Children’s School (TCS) strives to provide the highest level of student achievement in a supportive 
environment that includes academics, social emotional learning, arts, sciences and technology through the design and 
implementation of highly specialized instruction. At The Children’s School all children, parents, teachers, support staff 
and administrators collaborate to build a true community of learners that supports the whole child with a strong 
emphasis on the Arts. In the arts, our students receive instruction in Dance, Music and Visual Arts and new to TCS will

be a Theatre Arts program. There is a strong emphasis on tolerance and respect for all people as is evidenced by our 
One School, One Book initiative.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
P.S. 372K, The Children's School is a collaboration between District 15 and District 75 and has been in existence since 
1992. Currently, the school is made up of two very different sites. The Carroll Street site is a fully Integrated Co-
Teaching program that has a full compliment of related services and whose focus is giving students access to the 
general education curriculum. The site located within the M113 building is a program that serves students on the 
Autism Spectrum in Self-Contained (6:1:1) classes. The mission of the school, as noted above, is to provide the highest 
level of student achievement in a supportive environment that includes academics, social emotional learning, arts, 
sciences and technology through the design and implementation of highly specialized instruction.  

 

Our 6:1:1 site designed as a language based program that teaches each child to become as independent as possible; 
to improve each child's ability to function at home, in school, and in school in the community. Our ICT program is 
designed to meet the needs of special education and general education students in one classroom. The classrooms at 
ICT are staffed with two teachers and one classroom educational assistant. Teachers are highly qualified in their 
respective discipline and teachers receive professional development at the district and school level.  

 

The Children's School provides a rich curriculum that includes reading, writing, math, social studies, science and the 
arts. During reading instruction, teachers create small groups within their classrooms that allow specialized work with 
students who require intervention and well as students who are exceeding grade level standards and require 
enrichment. This year, all classes will use Leveled Literacy Intervention (LLI) for students who are not meeting grade 
level standards. In Math, grades 5 will continue to use a departmentalized math program which allows for small 
targeted instruction based on data that is from the end of chapter summative assessments. In K-4, teachers create 
small groups that are also based on summative chapter assessments. New this coming year will be the 
implementation of Do The Math, a math program used for struggling learners. Our writing process in grades 3-5 
begins with Judith Hochman's Expository Writing strategies. This was decided by teachers and administrator's during 
academic cabinet that focused on the analysis of student writing samples. This work will continue for the upcoming 
school year. For Social Studies, we will continue to use teacher created units of study that is supported by the use of 
the Passport to Social Studies curriculum. Our Arts are aligned with the social studies curriculum and new to the 2018 
school year will be the addition of a Theater arts teacher that will enhance our already amazing arts curriculum. The 
science program will continue to use Foss and new for this upcoming school year, we will begin the conversion to 
align our science curriculum to the Next Generation Learning Standards.  

 

The arts and technology are integral to our educational programming for all of our students and are integrated 
throughout the curriculum. In conjunction with our Parent Teacher Association, we are able to implement the 
following programs and initiatives into our everyday curriculum. We partner with cultural organizations such as 
Brooklyn Conservatory of Music, Learning by Design, Mark Morris Studios, David Marquis Residency, Jazz at Lincoln 
Center and Center for Arts Education to name a few. Each grade from Pre-K to 8 benefits by participating in at least 
one cultural partnership program annually. During the 2018 school year, Brooklyn Conservatory of Music joined our 
After school Enrichment program to add a Band program to the already rich Arts education that students receive. This 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

program will continue for the new school year. Also new to the upcoming year is a Theatre Arts program which will 
surely enhance our Music, Visual Arts and Dance programs.  

 

TCS continues to partner with the Mayor's Zero Waste program which focuses on reducing, reusing and recycling. The 
school is committed to living a greener lifestyle by separating out our food scraps for compost and recycling all else. 
The school has partnered with Cafeteria Rangers to assist our students with understanding how and what to recycle 
especially in our classrooms and in our cafeteria.  

 

Our Pre-K classes will be a part of the Pre-K For All initiative. The initiative seeks to align developmentally appropriate 
practices set by the Department of Early Childhood Education. These practices support cognitive and social emotional 
well being of the students. Embedded in the program is an Instructional Coordinator (IC) who supports instruction 
within the program as outlined by the Pre-K Foundation for the Common Core (PKFCC) and a Social Worker who 
supports the social emotional development of students and families.  

 

The Children's School will continue with it's  five year plan to be a fully trained Thinking Maps school. Thinking Maps is 
a meta-cognitive tool that are used to capture and encourage reflective thinking. This tool provides students with a 
eight cognitive maps that support their ability to construct their thoughts and provoke critical thinking skills. These 
maps incorporate code and key words aligned to each map in order to facilitate and organize thinking in all subject 
areas. Unique to the program is the collaboration with Thinking Map trainers both at the district level and the school 
level. To ensure continuity of the program the school has invested time and funds to training staff to be Thinking 
Maps trainers (TOT's). Trainers work with colleagues on a regular basis to ensure that Thinking Maps are used by all 
teaching staff which includes assistants and related service providers.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our ASD site is a specialized language rich setting which serves students from ages 5 – 13. We employ a curriculum 
with a strong emphasis on communication, social interaction skills and independence for the students at the site. In 
addition, we incorporate opportunities for students to enhance their functional skills throughout the school day. This 
specialized program uses a language rich curriculum that is enhanced by best practices such as Joint Action Routines, 
the Picture Exchange Communication System, the use of high/ low tech voice output devices and supporting learning 
with Thinking Maps.  

 
Our Integrated Co-Teaching site serves students from Pre-K through grade 5. This site seeks to included children with 
a wide range of abilities in a single cohesive class with a special education teacher, a general education teacher, and a 
paraprofessional, who all work together to address the student's needs. While adhering to a rigorous curriculum, ICT 
challenges and empowers both general education and students with disabilities. Students are challenged to reach 
their highest potential academically, socially, and emotionally.

Rigorous Instruction: 

 

372’s rigorous curriculum is aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. The teachers work together to create 
and implement a curriculum that is customized and motivating for all learners. Our grass roots curriculum pulls 
from the philosophy and ideas of the Reader’s and Writer’s Project of Teachers College as well as the best practices 
from Fountas and Pinnell. Grade level collaborative teams come together to ensure the alignment of the Common 
Core Learning Standards in each of the six units of study. At our ASD site, six Thematic Units of Study aligned with 
the essential elements of the CCLS are embedded by the collaborative work of the ASD Academic Cabinet. Through 
reflective practice and inquiry, our Academic Cabinet has identified skill support for Guided Reading. As a result, 
our school has embedded the Fountas & Pinnell Leveled Literacy Intervention system for our at risk students. After 
reviewing our data, colleagues were trained in the necessary skills to support struggling students. To support our 
teacher created units of study in our Standards Based Social Studies curriculum, Passport to Social Studies will 
continue to be implemented. Our Science collaborative teams follow the Scope and Sequence of Science creating 
their own units of study that are further supported with FOSS kits and resources. In preparing for the 
implementation of the Next Generation Standards, we have aligned our current units of study with the necessary 
adjustments to meet the criteria in order to align them with the Next Generation. We have acquired the conversion 
kits which have assisted this process. In Math, we continue to support struggling students by enhancing our 
curriculum with intervention programs, such as Do The Math. 

ASD site, Ablenet’s Equals program is used with our K-5 and Attainment Math with our 6-8th grade. This program 
supports our 6:1:1 students’ in their math skills while being aligned to the Common Core Standards. In ELA, we 
utilize SMILE and Fundations for K-5 and Attainment in grades 6-8th. These programs are utilized to create an 
environment and school culture where all students feel supported and challenged. Teachers collaborate to analyze 
data, with support of the Instructional Coach, to make informed decisions for individualized instruction and small 
group instruction.  

The Children’s School analyzes data in an effort to maximize instruction within the classroom environment. Our 
data specialists have constructed a data base which creates a profile of each student. The database includes scores 
from New York State English Language Arts and Mathematics Standard Assessments, Benchmark Assessment for 
Fountas and Pinnell, Curriculum Based Math Assessments, Word Study, and where applicable, Academic 
Intervention Services.  

The curriculum initiatives that will be continued during the 2018-2019 Academic year are as follows: 

Thinking Maps, Responsive Classroom, Fundations, Fundations Cursive Writing, Words Their Way, Teacher’s College 
Units of Study, Go Math, Passport to Social Studies, FAR Assessment, FAM Assessment, Fountas and Pinnell 
Benchmark Assessments, Fountas and Pinnell Leveled Literacy Intervention, ABLLS-R, Equals, SMILE and SANDI 
FAST. New to our curriculum this coming year will be FOSS Conversion Kits aligned to the Next Generation 
Standards and Do the Math program. 

These initiatives are designed to provide children with the skills necessary to meet success that will lead to positive 
student outcomes. TCS prides itself on the trust across the school community. Everyone is working towards the 
goal of educating students at their level in the least restrictive environment. School staff, parents, student, and 
administrators all value each other and the work being done with all students across all content areas. 

The key area of focus will be to begin using Leveled Literacy Intervention for struggling readers in grades K-5. 

A second area of focus will to begin using Do The Math, a math intervention program for struggling learners in 
grades K-5.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12 

 

 

Collaborative Teachers: 

Teacher teams collaborative and are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and the school 
as a whole. Teacher teams meet daily during common preparation periods. New initiatives and curriculum are 
supported through in-service professional developments that are teacher run. The teachers are encouraged to 
obtain professional development externally. Their new found knowledge is turn keyed to their colleagues during in 
house professional development sessions. TCS celebrates professional learning and continuous school 
improvement. Internal support staff available include : 

Model Teacher, Peer Collaborative Teacher, Math Coach and an Instructional Coach. 

Staff are encouraged to attend professional development workshops in all content areas to enhance instruction in 
their classroom and implement what they have learned into their daily teaching practices with lessons aligned to 
the Common Core Learning Standards.  

Areas of focus for this is to have all teachers in grades K-5 trained in Leveled Literacy Intervention and Do The 
Math, both are programs used for struggling learners.  

 

Supportive Environment: 

School Administrative Cabinet and the School Leadership Team continue to review and assess practices and policies 
outlined in the CEP to determine if we are meeting our goals and objectives. This organizational practice affords us 
the opportunity to continuously review our goals and objectives.  

Emphasis continues to be placed on our work involving community building using the Responsive Classroom 
approach. When we began the initiative in 2016, the school community was invited to participate in the first of 
many Responsive Classroom institutes. At that time up to 25 staff members received Responsive Classroom training 
by a Children's School lead teacher. In the Fall of 2016, Responsive classroom Monday Professional Developments 
provided up to 10 teachers/ Paraprofessionals with the Responsive classroom Level one training. In the summer of 
2017, Level one and advanced level two is being offered to to 25 more staff members. In the fall of 2018 we will be 
offering Weekend Responsive Classroom Institutes to achieve our goal of by 2019; every teacher and 
paraprofessional will have received Responsive classroom development. All TCS classes will continue to conduct a 
morning meeting to build a positive classroom environment, using the Responsive Classroom morning meeting 
principles. Parents will be encouraged to participate in a workshop that will help them gain knowledge of the 
Responsive Classroom purpose and principles. This workshop will address the learning and understanding of the 
importance of beginning the day on time and with peers during the morning transition. In addition to the parent 
workshops, parents are invited once a week to the classroom to participate in the morning meeting alongside their 
child. Implementing this school wide initiative continues to have a positive affect on student's emotional growth. 
The PTA and the School Leadership Team continue to organize various school wide events that stress school spirit 
and a strong community.  

As as a school community we have worked hard to change the demographics of the school through changing our 
admissions criteria. As a part of the Diversity Pilot we have allotted a third of all incoming kindergarten seats to 
students who qualify for free and reduced lunch and/or are English Language Learners. This year we plan to 
increase our allotment to 50% of available incoming seats.  

Area of focus for the area of Supportive Environment is to continue to build a program around diversity and 
cultural responsiveness.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

 

Strong Family Community Ties: 

TCS embraces the strong collaboration that we have cultivated with the parents of our school community. Parents 
are an integral part in the success of our program and are actively engaged in their child’s education. This strong 
collaboration energizes the entire school and helps contribute to the students' consistently high level of 
performance. Through the work of the parent body, teachers, staff and administration, we are able to provide 
stronger Arts and STEM opportunities for the students in both the ICT and ASD community. TCS encourages and 
welcomes partnerships between families, businesses, and community based organizations. Organizations such as 
Brooklyn Academy of Music, Brooklyn Conservatory or Music, Brad Landers ( Council member for the 39th District 
of the New York City Council) and Robert Carroll (Assembly member for the 44th District of the NY State Assembly) 
and many more play an integral part of the school successes.  

 

Our Diversity Committee has an Outreach subcommittee that goes out into the community to meet with various 
groups throughout District 15 in an effort to recruit a more diverse student body to The Children's School. The 
committee also partners new families with "buddies" in an effort to help the families acclimate to the their new 
school community.  

 

In addition, the Parent Coordinator (PC), Related Service Providers (RSP) and Administration worked closely to 
organize multiple hands on parent workshops showing how RSP work with their children and how they can 
implement the similar strategies at home. This strong home /school connection has proved to be a powerful tool 
that will have children feeling more successful in both settings. 

This year we were awarded a $100,000 grant from State Senator Jesse Hamilton's office to update our playground. 
As a school community we look forward to working together to rebuild our playground.  

 

 

 

Effective Leaders: 

 

The current administration is entering into their third academic school year together. The principal has been a 
member of the TCS community for 13 years. Together all administrators work towards common goals of creating a 
sense of community, communicating a clear vision for the school, understanding how children learn, communicate 
clear expectations for meeting instructional goals and set high standards for student learning. The leadership team 
involves all stakeholders in decision making and wants all teachers to believe that they have a significant influence 
over the development of instructional materials. 

This year we will continue Principal's Advisory and Academic Cabinet. These committees affords the staff the 
opportunity to have a voice in the leadership of TCS. TCS has also created three distinct teacher roles to support 
teachers and build leadership capacity amongst the staff. We will have an Instructional Coach, Peer Collaborative 
Teacher, Math Coach and a Model Teacher to increase teacher capacity.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 

The Leadership at the school facilitates an environment where there is communication that is transparent; as 
evidenced by regular meetings that encourage and support positive and ongoing feedback. Annual data reflects 
that the majority of parents feel that the school leadership works to promote a sense of community through 
regular communication that addresses the unique language needs of the individual families. The leadership's 
policies welcome families into the school regularly to participate in academics, the arts, and social programs for 
their children. The administration encourages and supports family engagement through various planned annual 
activities.  

The area of focus for this to create a user friendly parent handbook.  

 

Trust:  

 

The school community works together in an effort to establish trusting relationships amongst school leaders, staff 
and parents. Trust is measured throughout the school by looking at how we communicate our high expectations to 
staff, students, and parents. Supports for families are provided to ensure their understandings of high expectations 
to prepare students to transition through the continuum of educational programs and services.  

 

Area of focus is to provide families with parent friendly workshops related to Speech, Occupational Therapy, 
Speech Therapy, and Counseling.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
At 372K we recognize that reading skills are vital to the everyday tasks and interactions that students will have both in 
school and in the outside world. Providing children in all grades a systematic multi-sensory program in the 
foundational skills for reading and spelling with an emphasis on phonemic awareness, phonics-word study, high 
frequency word study, fluency, vocabulary, handwriting, and spelling is critical. These important skills, when mastered 
give student's the foundation needed to read and write on and above grade level standards.  

 

The instructional cabinet of 372K which consists of Administrators, unit coordinator, Teacher leaders, Instructional 
Coach, and IEP teacher, collaborates to review student data found in our in house data system (File-Pro). This year we 
worked to improve student reading levels in Kindergarten using Leveled Literacy Intervention (LLI) in one class. The 
success of this program is evidenced by student growth. As a result of the success of this pilot, we have decided to 
expand school wide for the 2018-2019 school year with a focus on Grades K-2 however, at present time (January 
2019) the program has expanded into grades 3-5.  

 

Through analysis of reading data we have determined that 372K's priority needs to remain on providing a more 
systematic reading program to all students in all grades with a focus on grades K-2. The program must consistently 
monitor student progress aligned to the baseline criteria set forth by the Fountas and Pinnell Running Records. 
Through the purchase of new Fountas and Pinnell assessment kits, Leveled Literacy Intervention kits, leveled libraries 
available to all staff, and support of the reading specialist we feel that our reading scores will improve for grades K-2.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, students exiting grades K-2 will demonstrate an improvement across foundational skills such as fluency, 
phonemic awareness, and concepts of print as measured by formative assessments such as Fountas and Pinnel 
Benchmark Assessments (Running Records) and identified end of unit Fundations assessments as evidenced by a 20% 
increase in the number of students exiting on grade level or above.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
 

Parent workshops will be provided by Teacher Leaders including, Model Teacher, Peer Collaborative Teacher and 
Instructional Coach, and Related Service providers such as Speech Teachers and Reading Specialist a minimum of 
three times per academic year. These workshops will focused on our current reading programs and other areas that

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
In order to promote diversity, students who qualify for free and reduced lunch and/or designated as English Language 
Learners will be given 1/2 of our admission seats for Kindergarten admissions cycles. After reviewing the Kindergarten 
enrollment statistics for the 2016-2017 school year (3% were ELL and 17% were free and reduced lunch), this program 
will support our initiative to increase diversity amongst our school population. Based upon this data for the 2017-2018 
school year 20% of our Kindergarten seats were to be offered to students who qualify for free or reduced lunch 
and/or identified as ELL. As of June 2018 our school wide demographics were as follows: 20% Hispanic students, 8% 
Asian students, 10% black students, and 4% multiracial students.  

 

Ongoing efforts will continue to be implemented in order to increase enrollment which better reflects the ethnic 
diversity of the surrounding neighborhood and district. A review of the data has shown that 1/3 of the seats does not 
change the demographics of the school therefore we are continuing the work on this initiative by offering 50% of our 
kindergarten seats for the 2018-2019 school year to students who are ELL and/or eligible for Free and Reduced Lunch 
and actively participating in community outreach to attract a more diverse student body.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, the Diversity Committee of the SLT will work closely with the parent coordinator, Diversity Outreach 
Coordinator and Administrators, to create and implement a Supportive School Environment plan to involve a more 
diverse population of students in all grades that better represents the community through a minimum of three 
community based events within the school.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

As evidenced by the two Principal Performance Observations completed during the 2018-2019 school year the 
administrative team is working hard to ensure that resources are being maximized to build teacher capacity and 
support the school’s instructional goals. Funds are allocated for the development of instructional units for students in 
standardized and alternate assessment. The purchase of curricula and instructional programs such as Fundations, 
Responsive Classroom, Hochman Writing and Thinking Maps to enhance teaching and learning. The administrative 
team uses human capital to enhance programs and initiatives, for example the hiring of a Instructional Coach, Peer 
Collaborative Teacher, Model Teacher, Math Coach, TOT (Trainers of Trainers), Unit Teacher, Data Specialist, AIS 
support teachers to support teacher development, and per diem coverage that enables teachers to conduct inter 
visitations across sites is impacting instructional and organizational coherence across this diverse organization. 

The Administrative Team builds capacity through the bi-monthly Academic Cabinet and Principal Advisory meetings. 
These teams are part of the shared decision making process at the school.  

Additionally a hiring team was created made up of admin, coaches and teachers to be reflective of the school 
community in an effort to interview and observe prospective teachers, related service providers, and support staff.  

Continuing to develop teacher leaders is a priority for the Administrative Team.  Teachers individually and in teams, 
are engaged in structured professional development to improve their practices. Teachers teams are afforded time 
during strategically scheduled common preparation periods to provide them with opportunities to meet and share 
best practices. Teachers are part of different teams, comprised of new and veteran teachers. Teacher teams spend 
time analyzing student work to ascertain why certain students are not making adequate progress. Teachers at the 
school collaborate in teams and during their own time. They visit each others classrooms and network often. Teachers 
are encouraged to take leadership roles in their areas of expertise. Speech Teachers support classroom teachers with 
monthly language reviews of individual students at the ASD site. There are six Trained Trainers who support their 
colleagues with Thinking Maps. The technology teacher assists teachers with technical aspects of learning as we work 
to expand our instructional technology program at both sites. Our Instructional Coach meets, on grade, to strengthen 
instructional practice using data and inquiry cycle format. The Math Coach will support teachers in differentiating 
instruction for all students after analyzing the benchmarks and end of chapter assessments. The Peer Collaborative 
Teacher will play a role in leading grade and team meetings, aquiring resources/materials to enhance instruction. Our 
Model Teacher will continue to employ strategies to support classroom teachers by modeling TEACCH practices and 
extensive targeted instructional support. Administration has developed a schedule to support the time needed for our

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 372K, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS 372K will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee;

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

372K, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is implementing 
a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and 
the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, agree that this 
Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for improved academic

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our Integrated Co-teaching (ICT) site uses ELA assessments, which include running records, end of unit writing and word study 
assessments (Fundations), throughout the school year.  The Running Record assessment measures the fluency and 
comprehension level of each student.  The end of unit writing pieces measure organization, content development and use of 
appropriate grammar.  In determining the independent reading level of each student, teachers create a plan in moving 
students to the next reading level by referring to the components necessary in the instructional level of their reading. 
 
At our Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) site we use ABLLS-R and SANDI/FAST to assess our students' growth. Sections that are 
particularly useful for data analysis with ELL students include labeling, intraverbals and reading. In 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

addition, Fundations assessments and Running Records are used throughout the year to assess students reading levels.  
  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

We have ongoing professional development coaches provided by Fundations  and Thinking Maps trainers for teachers at all 
grade levels. Additionally, teachers meet weekly at grade level meetings to review student work and data which informs 
instruction.  Our reading specialists provide professional development around running records and other literacy assessments 
to ensure consistent practices across the school.  The ENL teacher reviews data and discusses progress with classroom 
teachers on the students' performance on these assessments to help her in developing her instructional goals and plans.   The 
school pacing calendar allows for sufficient time to administer these assessments throughout the year. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Our ELL program is evaluated based on NYSITELL and NYSESLAT test scores, State ELA assessments, classroom assessments 
(ABLLS-R, Sandi, Fast, Equals, Smile, Fundations, Running Records, DYO), and analyzing student work.  Consistent growth in 
language development is reflected in the analyses of these assessments and an indicator of effectiveness of our ENL 
program.       
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The ENL teacher, classroom teachers and related service providers collaboratively analyze individual student data and make a 
targeted instructional plan for each student based on individual needs. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
At our ICT site, D15 ELL students who are struggling to meet grade level standards are closely examined by our RtI committee 
when the need arises.   The committee analyzes ELA assessments, which includes running records, end of unit writing pieces, 
and word study assessments, throughout the school year.  The Running Record assessment measures the fluency and 
comprehension level of each student.  The end of unit writing measures organization, content development and use of 
appropriate mechanics.  In determining the independent reading level of each student, teachers create a plan in moving 
students to the next reading level by referring to the components necessary in the instructional level of their reading.  It is only 
after students move through the RtI process, they may recommended for D75 services.      
 
At our Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) site we use ABLLS-R, Equals, SANDI/FAST, Smile/Fundations and DYO assessments to 
guide ENL instruction. Sections that are particularly useful for data analysis with ELL students include labeling, intraverbals and 
reading. In addition, team meetings are held in collaboration with related service providers to guide instruction and necessary 
interventions.  Monthly Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) review meetings run by our speech team review 
PECS data and assess student communication progress and needs for further support.  Data is used to guide instruction of 
functional skills within ENL stand alone and integrated classes. 
 
 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
We use the NYSITELL (when applicable), NYSESLAT, State ELA assessments, ABLLS-R, Sandi, Fast, Equals, Smile, Fundations, 
Running Records, and DYO assessments to inform our ELL program.  Students use the PECS or output devices (LAMP, 
IPADS) and other visual supports to aid in communication during assessment.  We use test scores to determine student 
proficiency levels which directly informs the ENL teacher's schedule. 
 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

The ENL teacher shares NYSITELL and NYSESLAT scores with teachers and discusses strengths and challenges for the individual 
student based on these state tests.  These reports, paired with student data recorded in student binders and carried with 
student from year to year, help inform instruction.  For students with IEPs, these findings are also discussed at IEP meetings. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

At our ICT site, ELL students participate with their monolingual peers in the Teachers College Workshop Model of 
curriculum instruction.  Mainstream academics are adapted using ENL strategies.  The Workshop Model and small 
group instructional strategies address the need for improved reading comprehension and writing applications of our 
ELL students.  At our ASD site, ELL students participate with their monolingual peers in a 6:1:1 setting throughout the 
day.  At our ASD site, 6:1:1 students may be grouped within three contiguous grades. 
  
All ENL instruction is provided as an integrated /stand alone program by an ENL teacher with both a TESOL and a 
Common Branch License 1-6. Instruction is in alignment with the New York State Standards for both standardized and 
alternate assessment.  This model implements an integrated approach to instruction based upon the interconnection 
among all instructional areas and support services, with shared responsibility among all professionals and 
paraprofessionals serving English Language Learners.  
  
Our ENL program provides English instruction by providing a combination of stand-alone and Integrated methods of 
instruction.  In our integrated ENL model, the ENL teacher works with ELLs in collaboration with a classroom teacher 
to promote language acquisition and vocabulary support.  During stand alone ENL, the ENL teacher pulls students out 
to a separate location and delivers instruction to develop English language skills so that students can succeed in core 
content courses such as ELA, Math, Science and Social Studies.   
  
Students are generally grouped by grade/class at both the ICT and ASD sites.   The ENL teacher takes each student's 
proficiency level into account when scheduling stand alone lessons and differentiating instruction.    

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

  We do not currently have this program. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

  We do not currently have this program. 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

          
The Children's School has one ENL teacher who provides instruction at both our ICT and ASD sites.  Given the staffing and 
geographical restraints, students receive the maximum number of minutes of ENL instructional possible.  The ENL teacher 
creates a schedule based on student proficiency levels as determined by the previous year's NYSESLAT scores as well as 
incoming students' NYSITELL scores.  In as much as possible, students receive the mandated minutes as per CR Part 154. 
 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Content Area Instruction:   
All subject areas are taught in English by the General and Special Education classroom teachers. Native language support is 
provided as needed by bilingual school staff members. All teachers who are not TESOL certified have received or are in the 
process of receiving the mandated hours of Jose P. training to develop their proficiency in using ENL methodologies in their 
instruction.   All non-TESOL certified and non-bilingual certified (special education bilingual in the case of D75 schools), are 
provided with opportunities by the D75 office of ELLs to attend professional learning sessions on ELL topics which fulfill 
requirements for Jose P. Training and count toward the CR Part 154 15% of total PD required. In addition, during integrated 
instruction, the ENL teacher models specific methodologies such as the Natural Approach, Language Experience Approach, 
CALLA and Cooperative Learning that the content area teachers later use in their own instruction. 
  
English Language Arts:   All students will receive ELA instruction during our Balanced Literacy Program, and Writers/Readers 
workshop provided by the classroom teachers. In addition, special emphasis will be placed on providing current and former 
ELL students, with strategies that will improve their reading comprehension, writing, critical thinking and problem solving 
skills. During these lessons, an emphasis is placed on language development by using the Language Experience Approach, 
CALLA and Cooperative Learning.    
  
The Children's School fosters students’ academic language development through the use of, for example, units of study or 
thematic units in content areas in order to move the students along the language learning continuum. The instructional 
strategies that are embedded into content area instruction and used to ensure that students meet the New York State grade 
level standards include, but are not limited to: Content Based Instruction, Language Experience Approach, Task-based learning, 
Thinking Maps and Cooperative Learning.  The use of technology is incorporated into all content areas; the arts across the 
curriculum provides for a multi-sensory and multicultural approach to instruction thus further supporting ELLs.  Multi-sensory 
and multicultural materials are infused throughout all aspects of instruction.  In addition, scaffolding strategies are used to 
clarify and reinforce classroom learning for our ELL students.  Some of the strategies used in our program are: 
  
        Modeling:  Students are first introduced to new vocabulary.  Students are then walked through an example of the task 
they are asked to complete. 
  
        Bridging:  Students are asked to activate prior knowledge of a topic in anticipation of the new vocabulary and content 
information that will be used to better understand and reinforce the relevant class work. 
  
       Schema building:  Previewing a text with emphasis on ENL adapted vocabulary and context building and help clarifying 
reading assignments and directions.  Also, students receive brief oral lessons before they are taught in the main Language Arts 
or Content Area class. 
 
       Thinking Maps:  PS372 has undergone extensive training in Thinking Maps.  All classes integrate Thinking Maps as a routine 
method for note-taking, idea development and language building during classroom instruction.  Thinking Maps are used as a 
consistent visual organizer in every grade and content area. 
 
These are employed while engaging the students in the Workshop Model of Instruction in all subject areas. This model 
provides for individualization and small group work. The Teachers College Model of instruction is the Language Arts curriculum 
blueprint for the ENL instruction program.  A mini lesson is first presented to the class and then students break into small 
groups to work on the assignment.  This is the opportune time to work with individual students or in a group.  The grouping is 
in an integrated setting as he/she works with his/her monolingual peers.  Specific skills can be worked on in Reading and 
Writing during this time.  Students who are mandated for bilingual instruction receive additional support by the alternate 
placement paraprofessional.  This model provides for individualization and small group work.   
  
The Comprehensive Balanced Literacy Program we employ focuses on the individual child whereby students are matched to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

“just right books”; they are assessed informally on a regular basis and they receive specific reading/writing skills to help them 
become proficient readers and writers.   The use of technology is incorporated into all content areas; the arts across the 
curriculum provides for a multi-sensory and multicultural approach to instruction thus further supporting all learners.  
 
At our ASD site, curriculum is modified and differentiated to meet students at their skill level. We use small group and 
individual instruction and work collaboratively with related service providers in order to make content comprehensible and 
help students obtain functional skills that will provide them with greater independence.  
    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

The Children's School ensures that students are appropriately evaluated in their native languages.  Spanish speaking students 
who do not pass the NYSITELL are given the Spanish LAB.  Additionally, bilingual psychologists are available for annual 
meetings and evaluations and bilingual paraprofessionals help with assessment and data collection in the students' native 
languages.     
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

For SIFE students, should we receive any, tutoring and AIS services will be arranged immediately in order to assess initial 
literacy in native language and facilitate English language development.  
 
Newcomer students  (0-3 years) receive both stand-alone and integrated instruction.  The ENL teacher continuously confers 
with classroom and specialty teachers and uses ENL methodologies (such as CALLA, Whole Language and TPR) to ensure 
content is comprehensible and that the students language learning needs are being met.   
 
For students who have receiving service for 4 to 6 years, we continue their ESL services, as per their IEP, and in accordance 
with their proficiency levels indicated on the NYSESLAT.  In addition, tutoring and AIS services are provided as deemed 
necessary.   
 
Since we are a K-5 school, unless a student has been held over, we generally do not have students that fit the category of long 
term-ELL (6 + years of service). 
 
Students who score proficient on NYSESLAT will continue to receive ELL support with 90 minutes (.5 units) of integrated ENL 
instruction per week.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
The Children's School currently serves ELLs with Special Needs and instruction is designed to target those students' language 
and development needs.  
  
At our ASD site, ELLs are taught core subjects of math, science, ELA, and social studies through with age/grade level 
appropriate curricula.  Teachers currently use Fundations and SMiLE to teach reading and writing skills, and Equals is the math 
program used in all classes.  Additionally, teachers build on thematic units which promote language fluency and accelerate 
English language development.  Attainment Secondary Curriculum is used with our middle school students. 
  
At our ICT site, we incorporate instructional materials and strategies that are used to ensure that students meet the New York 
State Common Core grade level standards.  Materials are aligned to the Common Core and include: Go Math, Fundations and

Academic Language Approach, Language Experience and Whole Language. The use of technology will be incorporated to give 
students additional instructional support. Multi-sensory and multicultural materials will be infused throughout all aspects of 
instruction.  Additionally, teachers attend professional development workshops to foster their use of best practices when 
working with this special population.    
     
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The students who attend The Children's School at our ICT site participate in the the inclusion model.  Therefore ELL-SWDs have 
direct access to core standard curriculum and materials and resources associated with the general education curriculum  The 
instructional strategies used by classroom teachers, specialty classes and the ENL teacher support that curriculum and help 
accelerate language development .   Additionally, the ENL teacher makes every attempt to use the push-in model which 
enables ELL-SWDs to remain with non-disabled peers as much as possible.  Some of these strategies include modeling, 
bridging, and scaffolding.  Students who attend our ASD site use the ABLLS-R curriculum and Fundations/SMiLE phonics 
reading program in addition to theme based instruction based on Essential Elements in reference to ELA and Math.   When 
possible, both our ICT and ASD site classroom teachers, related service providers and ELL teacher work together on scheduling 
integrated and stand alone sessions out sessions to enhance student learning for ELL-SWDs.   
  
   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Our school offers AIS during school and after school for qualifying students.   All of our Standardized Assessment ELL students 
who are not meeting Common Core Standards are eligible to receive AIS services. Additionally, test accommodations for ELLs 
and former ELLs who have an IEP will be in alignment with IEP recommendations made by our SBST team and former ELLs 
without an IEP will receive test accommodations for two years. 
  
Additionally, ELLs are eligible for interventions provided by our school based reading specialists. Go Math is used to target 
development in math skills at our ASD site and Equals is used at ASD. 
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We will embed an additional year of Fundations into our curriculum.  Fundations will run from kindergarten through third 
grade.  Additionally, all students will have handwriting instruction.  Kindergarten through second graders will work on 
manuscript writing and third, fourth and fifth graders will practice cursive writing.   We will continue with Passport to Social 
Studies curriculum and add the Passport consumables piece to instruction.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We currently do not have a bilingual program. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs may participate in either of the two after-school programs offered at The Children's School.   District 15 and District 75 
students from our ASD and ICT programs can attend our After-School/child care/homework help based program from 3:10-
6pm.  This program is located at the ICT site.  Participating ASD students arrive by bus. Parents pay a fee for this program and 
the 
After School Program charges a reduced rate for students who qualify for free or reduced school lunch.  Financial aid is 
available for families who do not qualify for the reduced rate.  Children may also participate in our After-School Enrichment 
Program and pay a reasonable fee for enrichment classes ranging from gymnastics to ceramics and cooking. Any and all 
activities that take place during the school day are made available to ELLs and non-ELLs alike.     

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

   
  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Instructional materials, including technology used to support ELLs include: PECS, Mayor Johnson symbols, ABLLS-R, SANDI, 
FAST assessment curriculum, augmented devices, Spanish language books and materials, teacher made materials and adapted 
books at our ASD site.  At our ICT site, we use Smartboards, laptops, I-pads, desktop computers, Starfall,  Brainpop (Jr. and 
ESL), Spanish/English and Chinese/English dictionaries and books, picture dictionaries and workbooks, Reader's Theater scripts 
and activities, Language building games, teacher made materials and adapted books as well as all materials used in our ICT 
classrooms. 
  
   
  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home Language books and supplemental materials are made accessible to students in our ENL program. Additionally, bilingual 
staff are available to support and translate for students and families in various languages. When possible, students are placed 
in classrooms with bilingual staff to enhance their home language support. In All efforts are made to support ELL students who 
have a bilingual mandate, but for whom there is currently no bilingual class at the school, with the services of an alternate 
placement paraprofessional who is fluent in the student's home language and in English. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Students are grouped both in their classrooms and as well as in their pull out ENL groups according to their ages and grades. 
This allows for ease of scheduling and maximizing resources and services provided. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
The Building Counsel meets once a month.  All principals of the three schools which are co-located at our ASD site meet to 
discuss the shared space and resources available for students. 
  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
A newcomers family picnic or family welcome gathering is scheduled during the summer or the beginning of the school year 
for parents to socialize and ask any questions they may have about The Children's School.  When necessary, an interpreter will 
be available during these workshops and events.   Additionally, our Parent Coordinator holds  a welcome meeting each Spring 
for new families who will be entering kindergarten the following school year.  In the Spring, all new families receive a buddy 
(parent volunteer) who shares their contact information and is available for questions.  The new families are matched to 
volunteer families that speak the same language. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Currently, no language electives are offered at The Children's School.   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

At this time, we do not have a dual language program.       
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The ENL teacher attends ongoing professional development workshops provided by the District 75 Office of English Language 
Learners. These workshops cover topics such as co-teaching, designing effective classroom assessments, supporting ELLs in a 
monolingual classroom, and promoting language acquisition through visual arts. All teachers at the Children's School are 
invited to attend these workshops as well.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 
As stated above, the ENL teacher regularly attends PD workshops provided by District 75 OELL as well as appropriate 
workshops provided by DELLSS. Classroom teachers are encouraged to attend these workshops during the school year as 
well.  All non-TESOL certified and non-bilingual certified (special education bilingual in the case of D75 schools), are provided 
with opportunities by the D75 office of ELLs to attend professional learning sessions on ELL topics which fulfill requirements for 
Jose P. Training and count toward the CR Part 154 15% of total PD required.  
 
Our ELL teacher will turn key information and strategies learned at professional development workshops focused on the 
teaching of ELLs.  She will turn key this information at teacher grade level and all-staff monthly meetings. Additionally, staff will 
be informed of district-wide ELL professional development opportunities such as the Jose P. training and other ELL related 
workshops. 
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The ENL teacher attends IEP meetings for ELLs with IEPs. Additionally, she schedules at least one face-to-face meeting with the 
parents of each ELL during the year. These meetings take place at the parents' convenience during regular school hours. 
Record of attendance is kept with the ENL teacher's files and interpretation services are available either via a bilingual staff 
member or the Interpretation Hotline. 
  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

 
Parents of ELLs at the Children's School are actively involved in programs and events throughout the year. These include, but 
are not limited to, Roots & Community(community celebration), Arts Day, the Valentine's Day Dance, School Gala, various 
student performances, classroom celebrations, Pizza Friday (as parent volunteers), PTA, and curriculum nights. As needed, 
interpreters are available for parents to encourage and facilitate increased involvement.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Rosa Amato, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Identification of English Language Learners (ELLs) occurs at the Committee on Special Education (CSE) level 
through completion of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS), or at time of registration. We also use the 
ATS reports (RLER, LAB-R, RADP, and BIOS) to ascertain this information if we do not have the original HLIS. When 
new students who may not have gone through CSE come to our school, we initially identify primary language 
spoken by each parent by administering the HLIS and interviewing them.  

The intake interview is conducted in the home language. Bilingual school staff assist the ENL teachers in 
conduction the interview. If school staff is not available, the ENL teachers calls the Language Translation and 
Interpretation hotline. The school determines whether the parent(s) requires language assistance to 
communicate effectively and gives parents the opportunity to request it as well. Parents list a preferred language 
of communication on the Home Language Identification Survey and the blue emergency cards kept on file for 
each student.

2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.
