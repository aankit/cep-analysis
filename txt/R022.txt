Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

PS 22 is a diverse, multicultural, collaborative school community serving almost 1,000 elementary school children in 
the Graniteville section of Staten Island. Each member of our community is dedicated to achieving high academic 
standards for all of our students. Through standards-driven instruction, a nurturing environment, a focus on the arts, 
and the development of civic, social and technological skills, we are committed to creating a community of lifelong 
learners.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

PS 22 believes that each of our students has special gifts and talents. To foster the unique and different levels of all 
our students, PS 22 utilizes the workshop model in reading, writing, and math to enable children to self-direct based 
on their ability and learning modality. All children participate in a rigorous learning environment with high 
expectations. 

Based on the premise that every child can learn, we employ a multi-sensory approach to learning. Utilizing their 
strengths, students are provided with opportunities to explore their interests and assist them in acquiring skills to be 
College and Career ready. Programs to support this initiative include: 5th grade chorus, Art Squad, Technology Team, 
Peer Mediators, Stock Market Game, Virtual Y After School Program, partnerships with the University Temple of the 
Arts, the Mariners’ Harbor Library, Morningside Restorative Program, Lowes Sustainability Program, Algebra 4 All, 
Computer Science 4 All, No Place for Hate the Anti-Deformation League. Students also were able to interact with 
community agencies such as Break-Create(conflict resolution dance program) , Mighty Milers (physical education), 
Seeds to Trees (NYC Parks), VRQUEST (technology), Green Team (Grow NYC) enabling them to enhance their exposure 
to learning opportunities in the community. Selected teacher leaders will participate in the Teacher Leadership 
Program on a monthly basis. PS 22 also established a Wellness Council in partnership with P.E. Works (DOE initiative). 
The school also participates in the Comfort Dog Program which benefits all members of our learning community.  

 

 

For the last several years our school has been recognized as a gold star elementary school by the Anti-Defamation 
League for our implementation of their “No Place for Hate” program. We have also been recognized by the NYC DOE 
for our best practices around our P.B.I.S. program. We will continue to address school climate and decrease 
occurrence reports through these practices as well as incorporating the SANFORD-HARMONY program. 

 

Our fifth grade chorus at PS 22 has been recognized both on the local and international level. During the holiday 
season, the chorus annually visits senior facilities to sing for their residents. They have also performed throughout the 
city and state levels such as singing for the Inauguration of the Mayor of NYC. Professional musical artists have visited 
our school and mentored our students providing opportunities to grow their interests in the arts. These experiences 
led to the chorus being invited to sing at the Academy Awards as well as the Presidential Inauguration. 

 

Councilwoman Debi Rose donated funds to support our technology initiatives at the school. Through the Virtual 
Reality Quest program, our students learned how to redefine the art of storytelling using a multimedia platform. 
Students created virtual environments and showcased their creations on NY1 News.  

 

The Virtual Y After School program at PS 22 serves approximately 175 students daily. This program provides a 
seamless day for the students in our after school program. We became the first accredited after school program in 
New York City in the fall of 2001, and the largest accredited after school program in the country. 

Our strong commitment to ELL and Dual Language instructional practices have been highlighted and shared. Our 
school will be continuing the work of the Learning Partners Program. Utilizing the research based methods of Dr. Lily 
Wong Filmore, our ELL instructional team will continue to build upon strategies to support language acquisition and 
language development of our ELL students. PS 22 currently has 9 dual language classes and 2 bilingual special 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

education classes to further support this work. ELL parents are also invited to attend adult ELL classes two days a 
week in our building sponsored by the JCC. 

For the last several years, PS 22 has partnered with Teachers College Inclusive Project to strengthen our instructional 
practices around special education. Utilizing special education teacher teams and an Inquiry To Action model, our 
teachers participated in professional learning centered around Universal Design of Learning, writing quality I.E.P.'s, 
station learning, and portfolio development, with additional support from the FSC. We will continue to strengthen 
these instructional practices. We also will continue to be a demonstration site for District 31 around our special 
education inclusive practices. 

We are continuing to monitor our attendance rate. Over the last several years, the rate has harbored around the 93% 
range. To continue to support and foster good attendance for our students, our parent coordinator will partner with 
our guidance team to provide outreach to families with more than 3, 5, and 10 day absences. Student assemblies 
given by the principal will take place for those students with perfect attendance each month. Parent workshops will 
also be offered during parent engagement events to address this need for families. Research indicates that the more 
students miss school the chances are greater that the students will not be performing on grade level. To address this, 
we continue to monitor attendance by utilizing an attendance teacher and proving incentives to improve attendance. 

 

In the 2018-2019 school year. PS 22 will be launching The UFT Teacher Center which will provide CTLE credits for 
Teachers and Para Professionals. The UFT Teacher Center believes a systematic research-based coaching model can 
provide optimal growth in teaching practices and student learning. This coaching model uses the structure of Student-
Centered Coaching paired with Learning-Focused Interactions. Through ongoing Learning-Focused Conversations. TC 
staff and teachers collaborate to foster student success. 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

26.39% of the population at PS 22 are classified as special education students. These students are provided services 
along the continuum of services ranging from related services only to self contained classes (with/without 
paraprofessionals). Students are evaluated and given appropriate services such as speech, OT, PT, hearing, vision 
based on their needs. Teachers participate in professional learning geared toward inclusive practices that support a 
diverse population of learners. 

Our English Language Learners comprise of 17.31% of the students. Students are provided with a push in and pull out 
model. Students receive necessary services as required CR Part 154. Additionally, we offer support to students 
through after school programs and summer enrichment programs. As a Host site for the Learning Partners Program, 
our model teachers participate in professional learning specific to oral language development and support ELL 
teachers in the building in providing specific strategies for students. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our instructional focus for the 2018-2019 school year will continue to center around assessment capable learners 
through the formative assessment process. As per the 2016-2017 Quality Review an area of celebration was indicator

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
 

Based on data from TCRWP which analyzes running records for each student 5 x a year, data showed that students 
performing at levels 1 and 2 decreased by 2%. Progress was also noted in students performing at levels 3 and 4 by a 
2% increase.  

Based on feedback from the most recent Principals Performance Observation and our 2016 Quality Review, our school 
received a “Proficient” rating in Quality Review indicator 1.2. The report suggested that we focus on deepening our 
teachers work in teaching the students how to independently use success criteria robustly in ELA and Mathematics. In 
an effort to increase rigor for all of our learners, it was also suggested to consider the multiple entry points for 
student learning and continue to plan for differentiated tasks that promote higher order thinking. We seek to improve 
the ability of teachers to offer students descriptive, actionable feedback that is meaningful and authentic that will 
lead students to take ownership over their own learning. 

 

Informed by Capacity Framework Element-Rigorous Instruction, current data and our most recent QR and PPO there 
is a need to continue to refine curriculum and teacher practice around reading in order to increase performance levels 
of students in reading and writing. We will accomplish this by identifying priority/focus standards for reading and 
writing. These standards will encompass the school instructional focus as well as the literacy shifts. This includes 
developing students’ critical thinking skills to support rigorous discussions. This needs assessment informed the 
development of the annual goal listed below. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 

By June 2019, as a result of consistent progress monitoring, there will be a 4% increase (from 40 % to 44 %) in the 
percentage of students reaching proficiency (level 3 and above) on the NYS ELA exam as measured by the 2019 NYC 
School Quality Guide.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
To ensure we are actively modifying our instruction in reading, by February 2019 we will have administered and 
analyzed one formal TCRWP Running Record . The data from this assessment will be disaggragated and will allow for 
staff and administration to modify and create action plans as necessary to support diverse learners. This system will 
allow for school staff to access school wide data and determine trends by class/grade/school to use during Impact 
Teams, grade meetings, and instructional planning. 

 

ADVANCE teacher data will also be reviewed throughout the year with a specific focus on Domain 1a and 1e. 
Specifically, the focus will look to identify inclusion of Universal Design for Learning strategies to support diverse 
reading levels in each grade. During mid year teacher conferences in January we will discuss ADVANCE Measure of 
Teacher Practice data with teachers and ensure professional goals are monitored.  

 

Each month parents will receive a progress report on their child's independent reading level. This will foster 
communication between home and school and provide parents access to strategies to support student reading at 
home. Parents will meet with parents as necessary to discuss student progress. 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January 
Regents, etc.) 
TCRWP Independent Reading Record 

 

 
Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
 

The 2017-2018 PS22 Incident Level and Infraction Summary indicates a 14.5% overall decrease in the total number of 
infractions from December 2017 to April 2018. This shows that our PBIS initiative in addition to Sanford Harmony 
Lessons helped students to transition before and after short term school recesses. The staff focused on restorative 
practices to ensure a seamless transition back to instruction. Due to the 7.4% increase in overall infractions, our focus 
for the 2018-2019 school year will be around spreading the restorative practice initiative across the school by 
strategically placing teachers trained in "peace circles" with students that need the extra support. In addition, Tier 1 
trained staff will disseminate restorative practices to a partnered Tier 2 teacher. TCIS trained staff will continue to 
implement crisis intervention strategies. A comfort dog will be utilized to support students in crisis. 

Staff completed a PBIS Program Survey which measures benchmarks of quality for the program. Survey data from the 
2017-2018 school year highlight that we are developing in involving faculty, staff and students in the development 
and delivery of behavioral curriculum. This identifies a need to continue with open communication and dialogue in 
planning positive behavioral outcomes and strategies for our students. 

 

In accordance with the Capacity Framework for Safety and analysis of the above mentioned data, it is evident that 
there is a need to minimize disruptions to the educational process and increase positive behavioral outcomes. This 
will continue to be addressed through implementation of Tier 2 and Tier 3 interventions of our PBIS program. We will 
also continue to conduct Functional Behavioral Analysis to develop Behavioral Intervention Plans that will support our 
Tier 2 and 3 students. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
 

By June 2019, as a result of implementing restorative practices aligned with Sanford Harmony , there will be a 5% 
decrease from 23% to 18% of level 4 and 5 infractions as measured by the June 2019 OORS Occurrence Summary.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

During the last two years, staff members have been engaged in professional learning through the Core Collaborative 
for Math. Teachers have unpacked and identified priority standards and vertically analyzed the progressions to modify 
their units of study. Based on the 2016-2017 Quality Review indicator 1.2 Pedagogy and 2.2 Assessment, teachers will 
strengthen the practice of aligning assessments to curricula, use on-going assessment and grading practices, and 
analyze information on student learning outcomes to adjust instructional decisions at the team and classroom level. 
Using this as our instructional focus, teachers will engage in structured professional collaboration, capacity building 
and leadership development strategies which will allow the implementation of best practices. 

Participation in Core Collaborative professional learning directly impacts student achievement. In close examination 
of the 2016-2017 Math State test data, classes whose teachers participated in this learning, scored higher than there 
peers. This data demonstrates that the work will be shared among teachers of math to continue to support student 
achievement with mathematical practices. In addition, this will allow students to build on their conceptual knowledge 
and gain a more solid foundation in number sense. 

Informed by the Capacity Framework Element, the professional development sessions will provide the opportunity for 
staff to self-assess their instruction to enhance rigor. Teachers will work together to look at current assessment data, 
identify strengths and weaknesses among the grade and also identify trends. This will allow for the staff to adjust 
instructional strategies used within the classroom which will provide scaffolding and multiple entry points for all 
learners thereby increasing student learning outcomes. 

This needs assessment informed the annual goal listed below.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
 

By June 2019, as a result of building fluency and number sense, there will be 3% increase (from 33% to 36 %) in the 
percentage of students reaching proficiency (level 3 and above) on the NYS Math exam as measured by the 2019 NYC 
School Quality Guide.

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Based on our 2016-2017 Quality Review, it was indicated that there were strong practices in place utilizing the 
Danielson Framework for Teaching to elevate school-wide instructional practices as well as strong structured teams 
that utilize an inquiry approach and supports teacher leadership opportunities. These systems were designed to 
support professional development opportunities for teachers and build capacity to share instructional practices with 
the overall goal of supporting student achievement. 

Feedback also indicated that there was a need for cohesive assessment practices in our teacher pedagogy.  

In an effort to support teachers in establishing cohesive assessment practices, teachers will be offered Professional 
Development opportunities through the Core Collaborative Group specifically designed to unpack the standards to 
create appropriate learning intentions which address students multiple entry points. Teacher learning will further be 
supported by utilizing professional learning communities that link prior learning to instructional outcomes. Teachers 
will also continue to work with Paul Bloomberg and Lori Cook through the Canvas Platform and Core Collaborative 
Group so that teachers can deepen their work teaching their students how to use Success Criteria independently and 
robustly in both ELA and Mathematics to reflect on their practices and take ownership of their work. 

In accordance with the Capacity Framework Element (Providing guidance, development opportunities and advice for 
our staff), analyzing Advance data, and monitoring the progression of teacher professional learning goals we will 
create professional development opportunities and professional learning communities that align with teacher goals. 
Utilizing the observation process will further support teacher practice and provide a measurable outcome for teachers 
to utilize what they have learned in the practical application of their classroom. These will enable teachers to support 
student learning in their classrooms.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, as a result of classroom observations there will be a 3% increase (from 18% to 21%) in the percentage of 
highly effective teachers in all components of Domain three of the Danielson Framework as measured by the 2019 end 
of year summative ratings in Advance.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

The 2015-2016 Learning Environment Survey was completed by 35% of parents. The city average participation rate is 
49%. This identifies an improvement from the 2014-2015 school year. There is still a need to work on parent 
engagement practices to increase parent voice and involvement in the instructional needs of our students. 

The survey also identifies only 10% of our population attends PTA monthly meetings. This attendance rate is 
confirmed by attendance data provided by the PTA at monthly meetings. 

Attendance data at Parent Teacher Conferences suggest that 80% of parents attend these meetings twice a year. 
Other opportunities such as student performances, Parent Engagement Nights, and Parent Workshops are attended 
at about 35%. 

The Learning Environment Survey identifies that 68% of families communicate with school staff about their child’s 
academic progress several times a year. 73% of these families believe that teachers communicate regularly with them. 

Informed by Capacity Framework Element-Parent Involvement, effective communication and parent feedback efforts 
need to be refined to be better able to include parents in the instructional program at PS 22. Allowing parents to have 
better access to the school community will improve strong family community ties. This needs assessment informed 
the development of the annual goal listed below.

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
All teachers on staff are certified and identified as Highly Qualified. PS 22 works closely with our Human Resource 
Partner to ensure that all staff meets these requirements. Professional development is a key factor in supporting 
teacher effectiveness. Utilizing ADVANCE data as well as forming a professional development committee, we look to 
align professional development to meet the needs of our staff. Professional development activities are also supported 
through staff developers from Teachers College for reading and writing, a staff developer from TCICP to support 
utilization of Universal Design strategies in planning, and a staff developer from the Teacher Development Center to 
support utilizing questioning as a means for assessment. In addition, we have Teacher Leaders who support new 
teachers and hold grade specific workshops around topics of interest and need. Staff also utilizes workshops and 
professional development offered through the NYC DOE to support teacher and learning. A mentor teacher is 
assigned to all new teachers to the NYCDOE and building to meet the necessary mentoring hours. A study group with 
the mentor teacher is also held once a week to support new teacher effectiveness. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Professional development activities take place throughout the school year. Our professional development committee 
meets bi-monthly to discuss data and teacher needs. The first Monday of the month is used for professional planning 
around instruction. Based on planning, teachers will participate in professional learning communities focused on the 
inquiry process to address student needs. 4 staff developers work with teachers monthly and utilize lab-sites to 
support teaching and learning in the building.

intervention services, etc.). 
We will host 2 full day pre-kindergarten class for the 2018-2019 school year. They are an integral part of our school 
building. The pre-k teachers and paraprofessionals attend workshops both in and out of the building. Our pre-
kindergarten curriculum is aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and pre-kindergarten staff are offered 
opportunities to plan with kindergarten teachers to understand the skills kindergarten students need for entry. During 
the month of June, pre-kindergarten families are invited to meet with kindergarten staff and PS 22 administration and 
support staff to attend a workshop on how to prepare for kindergarten. Materials and books are provided to parents 
and students. This is also an opportunity to introduce different program choices offered at PS 22. 

We also work closely with the pre-kindergarten social worker to offer family workshops to support families with both 
the social and emotional and educational growth of the students. 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
In an effort to have shared decision making, we have utilized our MOSL committee and Professional Development 
teams to be an integral part of the decision making process around assessment measures and professional 
development. Our MOSL committee meets quarterly to review data, determine assessment criteria that best supports 
teaching and learning for our building. Together, assessments and criteria are established to measure teacher 
effectiveness as well as student performance throughout the year. 

Our professional development team meets monthly to discuss ADVANCE data, create surveys to staff, and decide on 
next steps for the professional development plan for the school. The plan is reviewed and revised as necessary to 
meet the changing needs of our students and staff. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

  

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S.22, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

PS 22 will support parents and families of Title I students by:

 PS 22  will  provide English language learners,  in grades 1-5 with supplemental instruction in 
our Title III after-school program. Based on our different sources of data, some of 
our English language learners are not always 
meeting their grade level reading and writing benchmarks.   Our  ELL students will be receiving 
additional support in developing and enhancing their listening, speaking, reading and writing 
skills through lessons aligned to common core learning standards. Students will be engaged in 
activities that are designed to increase their critical thinking skills, as well as language 
acquisition in English.  Our five ENL/Bilingual teachers will utilize various strategies to enhance 
and fortify Language and content acquisition. Our ENL/Bilingual teachers are implementing 
strategies from the work of Dr. Lily Wong Fillmore, which mainly focuses on text complexity, 
close reading and the teaching of  academic language. Mrs. Cucchiara(an associate of Dr. 
Fillmore) provided  our teachers with professional development on Dr. Fillmore's research about 
ELLs and their academic progress.  Dr. Fillmore believes that the lack of complex texts and 
higher expectations towards our ELLs is one of the main factors in  hindering  academic 
language and literacy skills to succeed and be college ready.  Our teachers prepare close read 
lessons by carefully choosing complex, compelling and concise texts to ensure all students are 
exposed to grade appropriate lessons. Teachers pre-teach vocabulary words and ask text 
dependent questions, followed by deconstructing and re-constructing rich (juicy) sentences. In 
addition, our ELL students will participate in small group Guided Reading lessons, Shared 
reading, as well as small group word study stations to develop their phonemic awareness and 
knowledge of sentence structures.  Students will increase their writing abilities through intense 
small group instruction while practicing oral language through academic discussions (turn and 
talk).  As we reviewed our NYSESLAT data, we have noticed that many or 
our Ells show deficiecy in the listening modality. This lack of listening skills is 
interfering with answering comprehension questions. Therefore, we will be diligent in providing 
more structured listening lessons .. Students will be able to listen to stories on smart boards, 
listen to read alouds and to books on Raz Kids.  Teachers will provide students with different 
scaffolds, such as, graphic organizer,  linguistic frames and sentence stems to enhance students’ 
listening comprehension.  
One of our goals this year,  is to  enrich our English language learners through the arts. PS 22 
will partner up with the Marquis Studios Program Residencies to integrate literacy with the arts. 
This program makes connection with the curriculum in  social studies . The residency is for 10 
weeks in length. The Teaching Artists would come to the school once a week for two hours. 
They will work with two groups per session.    By the end of the residency there will be a 
culminating performance and parents are invited to attend. The theme will be Dance around the 
World. Students will "travel" around the world experiencing different cultures through traditional 
dances. The culminating event will be a showcase of a wide variety of dances. 
Our Title III After School program will  invite first through fifth  grade ENL 
students.  Our subgrout this year will be transitioning and low expanding studets.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
The program will start at the beginning of November  2018 and it will end at end of March 2019. 
The sessions will take place 2 days a week, on Wednesdays and Thursdays, from 2:45 pm-4:45 
pm. The ENL students will be instructed by five  licensed ENL and Bilingual certified teachers. 
Our Bilingual certified teachers will support our Spanish speaking students, by providing books 
in Spanish as well as summarizing the lessons and directions for better understanding when in 
need. Our Ells will be grouped by grade heterogeneously with one certified Bilingual or ENL 
teacher. Groups will be formed with no more than fifteen students.  Our ENL teachers will keep 
a binder containing ENL students attendance, letters of invitation and any notification pertaining 
to the program  sent to parents in different languages, professional development attended, 
materials used for the program.  One of the administrators of PS 22 will supervise the Title III 
program. It has not yet been determined if another program will be running at that time. If an 
additional program is running during the Title III After School Program, there will be no costs 
associated to the Title III After School Supplemental Program.    Records will be maintained, 
including student attendance and program notification, in parents preferred language by  the 
Assistant Principal of ELL students.

An important focus at P.S.22 is the professional development of all our staff. As mandated by 
CR Part 80, our ENL and Bilingual teachers will attend 50% of professional development related 
to English language acquisition, mainly focused on best practices of co- teaching and integrating 
content and language instructions for English Language Learners.  All our staff and 
administrators are provided a minimum of 15% of professional development related to language 
acquisition to address the needs our our English Language learners. We take advantage of the 
ENL workshops offered by our Office of English Language Learners, and  Teachers College 
Reading and Writing program. This year Ms. Simpson, our ENL supervisor, will conduct a Book 
Study Club based on the book "Young Dual Language Learners" by Karen N. Nemeth. This 
book focuses on leadership, programming and how to address different home languages when 
assessing children and classrooms. The club will meet once a month during professional 
development time on Mondays.  
Ps 22 ENL teachers have attended and will attend various workshops related to English language 
acquisition and best practice for our ELLs:

Part C: Professional Development  
After attending professional development, our staff is given the  opportunity to turnkey new 
information to other teachers during schools meetings and PD sessions. Every Monday, during 
teacher team, our ENL, Bilingual and Dual language teachers meet to address our students needs, 
best practices and next step for our  instructional plans. In addition, the five certified 
ENL/Bilingual teachers who will be teaching in our ENL After school program will receive 8 
hours of Professional Development over the course of 4 days prior to the beginning of the Title 
III Program. This professional development will include looking at data from our new 
EDAT and most recent RLAT reports to instruct our ELLs based on assessments. Another one 
will be looking at the four modalities on the NYSESLAT, to guide effective instruction for our 
ELLs. We will also review progress reports from our RAZ-Kids online program and reading 
levels in  Teacher College Assessment Pro. The teachers will also be given time to train and get 
familiar with new books and materials from the National Geographic Learning programs “Reach 
into Phonics” and “Language, Literacy and Vocabulary”. Teachers will also have the opportunity 
to research Maryann Cucchiara’s list of complex texts and prepare 3 Ts lessons. These 
professional development sessions will be led by the supervisor and the ENL teachers of the after 
school program.  The dates for this professional development will be given from  December 
2018 -  March 2019.  Our model ELL teachers will provide professional development in between 
these dates to foster the strategies.  As part of the Host school for Learning Partner Programs, our 
teachers will participate in inter visitation with other schools around language acquisition and 
best practice for Ells.  
Records will be maintained including agendas and attendance sheets by the Assistant Principal of 
ELLs.

students come from homes where parents are unable to provide support in assisting their children 
with homework and school projects on a daily basis. Our ENL teachers  will be working 
diligently  to increase parental involvement and to provide assistance on how to support their 
children with school work at home. Such workshops will be conducted either, on Parent 
Engagement Project (PEP Family Night), and during Parent time every Tuesday after 
school.   At the beginning of the school year, our parent coordinator conducts a needs assessment 
of what parents would like for workshops.  This inventory is made available in the parents 
preferred languages. 
AS a culminating activity, our parents will be invited via back packed letters  to 
see their children performance. These invitation letters will be written in 
parents native language. Refreshments will be provided to them.  
 Parent workshops will be held on a bi-monthly basis, that will make six,  one hour sessions. 
These workshop will begin in November 2018 and end in April 2019.  Our  workshops will be 
provided by Ms. Simpson, our ENL supervisor, Mrs. D'Vicente, Mrs. Passarelli, and Ms. Fhamy 
our ENL certified teachers.  Some topics to be covered during these workshops will be:

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Providing parents with resources to help their children with academic issues to succeed in 
school; Understanding our Raz-Kids online reading program and how to monitor their children's 
reading; Navigating Think Central for our online Math program. Another parent workshop will 
be how to choose appropriate books to read to their children to develop fluency and vocabulary 
at home. In March 2019, we will offer a culminating parent and student celebration of the After 
School program. This year we wil have the Marquis Studio Residency Program Performance for 
parents.  Our school will provide refreshments and a presentation of their children best dance 
piece.    Our school hosts ENL classes for parents in the morning twice a week. Parents are 
notified of these workshops through translated letters prior to the beginning of the program, and 
during parents orientation meetings.  All records pertaining to our After School Program, such as 
attendance, sign out sheets, permission letters,  meetings, and invitations to attend the program 
will be maintained in a binder.  All information sent to parents is translated to parents native 
language.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
1.  Early Literacy skills of our ELLs are assessed with the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project(TCRWP) 
Assessment tool. This tool assesses the independent functional reading level of a student. Mrs. Passarelli, Mrs. D'Vicente, and 
Mrs. H. Fahmy , the ENL teachers, Mrs. Villalobos and Mrs. Hartnett, the Kindergarten Dual Language Teachers, Mrs. Ruffini 
and Mrs. Tait, the First Grade Dual Language teachers, Mrs. Lopez and Ms. Zipf,  second grade Dual Language Teacher, Mrs. 
Auslander, Third Grade Dual Language teacher, fourth grade dual language teacher TBA. and Mrs. Abreu, Bilingual Special 
Education teacher, and all general education classroom teachers of students of ELLs, review this data to determine each 
student's  reading level and skills. This assessment informs the teachers how well a student reads with fluency, accuracy, and 
comprehension. Based on the results of this assessment, we have found that the majority of our ELL population has literacy 
skills that are two or more levels behind their English proficient peers. Our school's instructional plan is then modified 
according to this data.  This informs us how to provide more supplemental activities for our ELLs to increase their literacy skills. 
It also informs all teachers if any other intervention strategies are needed for specific students, (ie SETSS, or After School for 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

ELLs.) Our Dual Language Classrooms and Bilingual Self Contained teachers also use ESTRELLITA and Fountas and Pinell, 
 Spanish Leveled Assessment to assess the reading levels of our Spanish ELLs in their native language. Through these 
assessments we have found that many of our ELL students in kindergarten end up acquiring both English and Spanish literacy 
simultaneously. As they move up in grades, their native language literacy skills increase alongside their English literacy skills, 
usually surpassing their English abilities. 
  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Once all summative data has been gathered, teachers collaborate among themselves to implement needed interventions. All 
reports are analyzed to determine each student individual needs. Our school leadership team ensures that lessons are aligned 
to each students needs. Students are periodically assessed to ensure they are moving up reading levels. Dual Language 
teachers use Estrellita to assess phonics skills.In addition, each classroom teacher has an assessment binder to monitor 
student growth. For upper grades Dual language teachers use the Sistema de Evaluaciones to evaluate growth in 
Spanish.  School leadership ensures that instruction is implemented based on the data and planning by checking in with the 
teachers to find out what supports they need for their program.  Teachers are provided common planning time to prepare 
lessons and strategies that will support the students and programs in place. Teachers can come together and share their best 
practices with one another to ensure that all students are receiving appropriate and vigorous instruction. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Our teachers determine the success of our ELLs by evaluating students outcome  at the beginning and ending of 
Teachers College Units.  In addition our teachers perform Teacher College Reading and Writing benchmark assessments every 
other month. Teachers use these assessments to drive instruction and to differentiate lessons for each student being assessed. 
The  ELL Periodic Assessment is an optional assessment that can be administered to our ELLs twice a year to determine their 
language skills and acquisition. This assessment provide teachers with specific students needs and how to address them. The 
NYSESLAT scores provide individual needs in the four areas of English language arts. Teachers are able to group students 
according to their language acquisition stage Teachers run  informal running record often to address students growth. 
conference notes and  teachers observations are part of teachers lessons. Our ELL teachers examine the data in the EDAT 
report which shows our ELLs progression from proficiency levels. This year our school met the Annual Measurable 
Achievement Objectives 1 that is to say, many of our students showed progress on their proficiency levels. The Bilingual 
teachers also utilize  El  Sistema de Evaluaciones to assess their students in Spanish.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 Teachers maintain an assessment data binder to monitor students' growth on a regular basis. General Education 
teachers  share data with the ENL teachers to ensure proper intervention is offered. Once ENL teachers have performed 
different kinds of summative assessments, they provide differentiated instruction to small groups. Teachers monitor students' 
progress between six to eight weeks to adjust interventions. Our ENL teachers provide support in students' home language 
when needed. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
 
 Our teachers evaluate student comprehension levels using Teachers College Running Record Assessments, periodical 
assessments, conference notes, teacher made assessments/checklist, and New York State ELA and Math scores to determine 
the need of the Response to Intervention Framework for our students. Our ENL teachers use high-quality research-based 
instruction that is differentiated for ELLs through data collection, monitoring of ongoing progress, and collaborating with 
colleagues in making student decisions based on the data collected. Teachers share their knowledge of student performance in 
the context of the regular classroom, as well as their expertise in the classroom content and grade-level skills. Mrs. 
DVicente,Mrs. Passarelli, and Mrs. Fahmy, our ENL teachers, establish a process for determining which students should receive 
Tier 1, 2 or 3 intervention. Our teachers further evaluate the levels of language acquisition through the NYSESLAT scores and 
years in the United States school system of the students to provide evidence for language needs. Students are placed in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

different tiered  groups for instruction. Our teachers provide differentiated and explicit instructions using scaffolding, while 
providing opportunities to apply skills and strategies in reading and writing as well as phonemic awareness and other 
foundational skills. Teachers monitor students progress during a period of six to eight weeks, re-evaluate and 
adjust  instructional  support as needed. Specific programmatic interventions used may include but are not limited to: 
Fundations Phonics program, small group instruction with targeted areas of focus, and guided reading groups. Once students 
have been intervened and re-assessed, teachers and the school based support team determine if a referral is warranted. The 
team meets to discuss students specific behavior  and abilities  and to determine if there is a language deficit or learning 
disability. 
 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
  After analyzing our data from the RLAT and EDAT, we noticed that our students scores ranged from emerging 
through expanding. Twenty four of all ELLs tested, received a commanding score. Our NYSITELL data patterns show that our 
newly admitted ELL students come in with stronger skills in listening and speaking than they do in reading and writing. 
According to the NYSESLAT data, students are more proficient in the listening/speaking modality over the reading/writing 
modality. Therefore, teachers will focus on the deficient areas. Teachers form groups according to students’ proficiencies and 
skills. Guided reading, shared reading and shared writing,  using Teachers College Reading and Writing Approach. In addition, 
ENL teachers group students and provide small group instruction using modeling, scaffolding and close read,  to further assist 
with reading comprehension and writing mechanics. 
 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Administration reviews data and distributes to teaching staff.  During teacher team meetings,  teachers analyze student data 
and create groups according to students' proficiency levels, language ability and skills. Teachers use the language progression 
chart which provides a breakdown of what students current language acquisition allow them to perform. The classroom 
teachers as well as the ENL teachers  provide differentiated activities that students are able to accomplish based on their 
current  abilities. These performance indicators for each modality are mapped to five levels of language progression that 
demonstrate how ELLs at each of the five levels can meet the Common Core standard for their grade level. 
Teachers  ensure   students have access to grade level texts and provide the appropriate support needed.  Teachers are 
expected to input student data monthly on Google docs for administrator review.  Along with observation cycles, 
administration uses these tools to support teachers in making adjustments to programs. Through classroom visits and 
meetings, administration ensures that adjustments are made. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Currently, PS 22 is servicing 192 ELLs. Grades K - 5 are serviced everyday using the integrated and stand alone models. 
In the integrated model the ENL teacher works with ELLs during Language Arts and/or content area instruction, 
depending on proficiency level, in collaboration with the regular classroom teacher to provide language acquisition 
and vocabulary support. In grades K-5, all mainstream ENL students are placed into one class per grade regardless 
of language level. This allows the ENL teachers to collaborate closely with the classroom teacher and 
provide instructional supports aligned with the curriculum being taught in the classrooms. By following the integrated 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

model, our ELL students are provided with opportunities to learn alongside their English speaking peers and 
receive instructional support without missing valuable lessons. Some students may be pulled out for additional stand 
alone, small group instruction when needed. Entering students receives 360 minutes of ENL services. These students 
receive 180 minutes of stand alone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA. Emerging students receive 360 
minutes of ENL services. These students receive 90 minutes Standalone ENL and 180 minutes integrated ENL/ELA. 
Transitioning and expanding level students receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL with ELA or any other content area. 
The ENL teachers use the stand alone model mostly to service the entering and emerging students to develop English 
skills in listening, speaking, reading and writing. 
 
  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Our school has a Transitional Bilingual Special Education in kindergarten and  first grade. These classes were designed 
so that students develop conceptual skill in their home language as they learn English. At the beginning of the school 
year,  instruction is conducted 75% in Spanish and 25% in English. According to research students acquire literacymost 
effectively in the language most familiar to them. As the year progresses and students are acquiring the 
English language, instruction is conducted mostly in English. Mrs. Posadas and Mrs. Abreu, our Bilingual Special 
Education teachers, determine which concepts or subject to teach in which language.   
 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Our Dual Language program is composed of,  two kindergarten classes following the side by side model, first grade 
has been changed to one class following the roller coaster model. to a side by side model too as well as second grade. 
Third grade follows the roller coaster model. Our Dual language programs have been designed to continue developing 
students home language as well as English language skills. Instruction in the Dual Language Program is given 50% in 
English and 50 % in Spanish. Our Dual language teachers follow the literacy program Estrellita for the lower grades 
and Teachers College for the upper grades. The students are learning from the  New York city  Social Studies program 
and the Amplify Science program. Teachers have materials available in both languages and also 
supplemental  resources and information. Math instruction is received through the Go Math Common Core Program. 
Dual language classes have materials for math in both  English and Spanish. In English Language Arts teachers are 
using The Teacher College program. The Dual Language classes have literacy materials in both languages. The Dual 
Language teachers create charts and graphic organizers in both languages. We use instructional scaffolding 
techniques from Maryann Cucchiara, who partners with Dr. Lily Wong Fillmore Our teachers prepare close read 
lessons by carefully choosing complex, compelling and concise texts to ensure all students are exposed to grade 
appropriate lessons. Teachers pre-teach vocabulary words and ask text dependent questions, followed by 
deconstructing and re-constructing rich (juicy) sentences. Teachers will provide students with different scaffolds, such 
as, graphic organizer, linguistic frames and sentence stems to enhance students’ writing. ENL teachers have been 
trained in these programs and have worked closely with classroom teachers to push in and support ELLs using 
strategies such as modeling, scaffolding and prompting to help make content more comprehensible for their English 
Language Levels. Teachers are also using the Teachers College writing curriculum where small unit skills are taught 
directly to and modeled for students. In all content areas we promote collaborative learning which encourages peer 
support, enhances motivation and increases language use. Smart board visuals and recording are used to help the ELL 
in the content areas. Computer activities through RAZ-Kids are also used to encourage and provide language usage. 
The teachers scaffold academic language and complex content to support students’ participation. We use stories that 
are based on students’ culture that connect to students’ prior experiences. 
 
   

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

                   Our school ensures that the mandated number of instructional minutes are provided according to level in each 
program model. Our ENL teacher arrange their schedule ensuring their ELLs receive the mandated minutes by grouping them 
according to their mandates. 
 
a. Students receive ENL minutes according to their English proficiency levels as per NYSELSAT scores. Entering students receive 
360 minutes per week of which 180 minutes are stand alone and 180 minutes are in integrated ENL/ELA. Emerging students 
receive 360 minutes per week of which 180 minutes is for ENL/ELA and 90 minutes of stand alone service. Transitioning and 
Expanding students receive 180 minutes per week in i1ntegrated ENL/ELA orENL/ content area. Native Language minutes for 
DL Spanish is 50% English NL 50%; TBE - NL 75% English 25%. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
 Content Area instruction in the Dual Language Program is given in both English and Spanish. The students are learning from 
the New York City Social Studies Program  and the "Foss Kit" for the Science Programs. Teachers have materials available in 
both languages and also rely on the Internet for additional resources and information. Math instruction is received through the 
Go Math Common Core Program. Dual language classes have materials for math in both English and Spanish. In English 
Language Arts teachers are using Teachers College reading and writing workshop models.The Dual Language classes have 
literacy materials in both languages. The teachers create charts and graphic organizers in both languages. Various ENL 
strategies are used to teach ELLs in the content areas. ENL teachers use these ENL strategies in both, Push in and Pull out 
models. In all content areas, we support the emergent and early development of English literacy skills.We support the ELLs as 
they develop academic language. ELL teachers are implementing Maryann Cucchiara's Text Complexity approach to assist 
students in close reading and vocabulary development. In all content areas we promote collaborative learning which 
encourages peer support, enhances motivation and increases language use. Smart boards visuals and recording are used to 
help the ELL in the content areas. Computer activities through RAZ-Kids are also used to encourage and provide language 
usage. The teachers scaffold academic language and complex content to support students’ participation. We use stories 
that are based on students’ culture that connect to students’ prior experiences. 
 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

    To ensure that ELL's are properly evaluated in their native language, the Dual Language teachers have been trained to use 
the Estrellita program to assess the students in the early grades. The upper grade teachers have been trained to use the 
Sistema de Evaluacion de la Lectura by Fountas and Pinnell. In addition, TBE and fifth grade dual langauge administer the ELE 
at the end of the year to all dual language students to assess their target language progress. Teachers administer this 
assessment in Spanish Literacy to their ELLs two to three times a year. They also assess their ELL students through running 
records, conferencing with students individually and in small groups and also through informal observations. The Dual 
Language teachers have taken the Teachers College Reading and Writing Assessment in English and created their own informal 
Spanish Literacy Assessment to use along with El Sistema de Evaluacion de la Lectura to assess their ELL students literacy 
development. 
  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 
  Our ENL teachers differentiate instruction for the different ELLs subgroups. A. Currently our school does not have any SIFE 
students. In the event that we admit SIFE students, we will screen  the child with the oral questionnaire  and all the 
assessments provided by the New York City Department o Education to determine the students prior education. Once this is 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

determined the  students will be provided with an enriching environment where they can acquire English in their own pace 
while building their strengths and self-esteem. ENL teachers will use the buddy system where students are paired with 
responsible students to help them adjust to our school environment. B. Our school has a large number of newcomers, for 
those students who are English pre-emergent and emergent; the ENL teachers provide support by using graphic organizers, 
allow sufficient response time, list instructions/process and review orally. Teachers frequently summarize key points in lessons 
and repeat important terms during interactive Read Alouds. ENL teachers create opportunities for guided reading and shared 
reading to further increase reading comprehension and oral language development. New students who have been in the 
school system for more than one year  take the NY State ELA test, the school provides an after school program to assist 
children in test taking strategies as well as reading and writing strategies. C. Developing ELLs are provided with strong language 
lessons while offering ample opportunities to have extended interaction with peers of varying English proficiency levels. This 
approach provide ELLs with a range of models for how to use English words or structures appropriately, as well as abundant, 
personalized feedback on ELLs’ own developing English use. Teachers sometimes group students heterogeneously according to 
English proficiency, and sometimes homogeneously, depending on the purpose of the task.  D. Our school has seventeen 
students who have been receiving services in the 4-6 years range. We continue supporting these ELLs by providing small group 
differentiated instruction with access to visuals, hands-on activities,  graphic organizers and students are grouped according to 
skills and abilities. In addition, the ENL teachers provide small group instruction to further assist students in vocabulary 
building and language interactions. Our Long Term ELL’s receive additional instructional time through the RTI Framework. The 
ENL teacher provides small group instruction in writing and reading to support the literacy instruction taking place in their 
classrooms. These long term ELLs have struggled to attain proficiency in the Reading/Writing Strand of the NYSESLAT. Some of 
our long-term ELLs are also Students with Disabilities (SWDs) who also receive additional support from Special Education 
teachers. Our plan for them is to align ENL instruction with the students’ academic goals on their IEPs. The ENL teacher and 
Special Education teacher meet regularly to discuss our Long Term ELLs progress and to plan appropriate intervention activities 
throughout the school year. E. Our former ELLs are placed in the designated ENL classrooms with  ELLs  and the ENL 
teacher provides additional support as needed. They also receive testing accommodations for two years after scoring 
commanding. As mandated per the new CR part 154; former ELLs are entitled for continued support for an additional 2 years 
after they achieve a commanding score on the NYSESLAT exam. The ELL teachers continue to work with these students for a 
minimum of .5 units per week. The ENL teachers follow the integrated model and continue to work with Former ELLs in 
content areas and ELA. As per new rules, classroom teachers are able to  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Mrs. DVicente, Mrs. Passarelli and Mrs. Fahmy  and teachers of Ells continue to implement more individualized instructions for 
our ELL-SWDs. One of our goals this year is to provide more ENL instruction in the students classrooms through use of the 
integrated  model. While they are still pulled out for part of their ELL mandated minutes, whenever possible we deliver 
instruction in their appropriate environments. We provide multiple strategies to  these students such as Mrs. Maryann 
Cucchiara's Three L's (Language, Learning and Literacy) text complexity approach to build academic language.This approach 
provides an instructional repertoire with research proved scaffolds for language and compelling texts for ELLs and SWDs . In 
addition, teachers use of manipulative and a heavy reliance on visuals, graphic organizers and guided practice in all content 
areas. Our ELL-SWDs have access to grade level appropriate materials such as text books in social studies and science. We 
preview the material and have the students review the academic content and domain specific vocabulary before and during 
instruction. To help accelerate their English language development, small group instruction is provided by using close read with 
emphasis on vocabulary  and questionings. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
    Our school uses curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs within the least 
restrictive environment by closely collaborating and communicating with these students' various service providers such as 
SETSS, Speech and Counseling teachers. Our school ensures that flexible programming is used to maximize time spent with non 
disabled peers by closely looking at ELL-SWDs individual IEPs. Through flexible scheduling an ELL-SWD may spend part of their 
day in a General Education setting for instruction based on their academic strengths. Monthly LRE( Least Restrictive 
Environment) meetings are held to discuss students who may benefit from a reduction in service, a change of service as 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

appropriate per the continuum of services. Also, ELL-SWD students participate in enrichment programs such as art squad, peer 
mediators and chorus. Their non disabled peers are with them in these programs. Whenever possible, the ENL teachers 
provide instructional support in their classrooms so they do not miss important academic content in all subject areas. Mrs. 
Passarelli,  Mrs. DVicente and Mrs. Fahmy   attend monthly Pupil Personnel Team meetings to familiarize about ELLSs/SWDs 
IEP goals and to provide information on students' Language Acquisition progress and participate in the ELLs referral process if 
required. We also have a Language Proficiency Team for these meeting.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
      
Teachers offer different types of intervention services for ELLs in the content areas. Some students will receive instruction 
from our Title III Funding after school program. The school also offers ELA, Math and ELL classes after school in the content 
areas. During the day the ENL certified teachers focus on the subjects the students are making less progress in. Our 
ENL/Bilingual teachers are implementing strategies from the work of Dr. Lily Wong Fillmore, which mainly focuses on text 
complexity, close reading and the teaching of academic language. Mrs. Cucchiara(an associate of Dr. Fillmore) is providing our 
teachers with professional development on Dr. Fillmore's research about ELLs and their academic progress. Dr. Fillmore 
believes that the lack of complex texts and higher expectations towards our ELLs is one of the main factors why they do not 
develop academic language and literacy skills to succeed and be college ready. Our teachers prepare close read lessons by 
carefully choosing complex, compelling and concise texts to ensure all students are exposed to grade appropriate lessons. 
Teachers pre-teach vocabulary words and ask text dependent questions, followed by deconstructing and re-constructing rich 
(juicy) sentences. In addition, our ELL students will participate in small group Guided Reading lessons, Shared reading, as well 
as small group word study activities to develop their phonemic awareness and knowledge of sentence structures. Students will 
increase their writing abilities through intense small group instruction while practicing oral language through academic 
discussions (turn and talk). Teachers will provide students with different scaffolds, such as, graphic organizer, linguistic frames 
and sentence stems to enhance students’ writing. ENL teachers have been trained in these programs and have worked closely 
with classroom teachers to push in and support ELLs using strategies such as modeling, scaffolding and prompting to helpmake 
content more comprehensible for their English Language Levels. The ENL teachers are working with classroom teachers of ELLs 
to look at the Go Math Program that we use and differentiate instruction according to their needs. Special Education ELLs are 
provided with small group instruction and also more manipulative and visuals to make the math more comprehensible. Our 
ELLs are encouraged to use computer programs such as, Starfall.com, Vocabulary.co.il, ABC Mouse, Raz Kids, along with 
Fundations. Students are encouraged to join the Chorus or the Art Squad where they can participate in subjects they excel in 
and at the same time speak English with their peers in a less restricted environment. 
 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

 A few programs and improvements have been implemented and will continue for the upcoming school year. An After School 
Program will be offered to assist all ENL students in small groups to further develop language arts skills. The Certified ENL 
teachers will use the RAZ-Kids reading levels in conjunction with read alouds, guided, shared reading and writing. Smart Boards 
have been installed in every classroom throughout our school to provide updated technology learning and core knowledge to 
our students. Smart boards accommodate different learning styles. Children and teachers are able to collaborate and interact 
in a given lesson. Cognitive research has shown that learning is most effective when the four fundamental characteristics of 
learning are present: Active engagement, participation in groups, frequent interaction and connection to the real world. 
Roshelle, Pea, Hoadley (2000). This is a very effective tool for our ELLs since it provides them with the visual, audio and 
interaction. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

PS 22 dismantled the transitional bilingual 3rd/4th grade class due to  students language needs. Most of our Ells are proficient 
in English. They will receive support from their bilingual paraprofessionals.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

        Our ELLs are encouraged to participate in any or all activities and programs that all of our students participate in. Many of 
our ELLs are in the chorus. The PS 22 Chorus motivates our ELLs to participate and become more confident in the use of English 
particularly with their verbal skills. The art squad encourages our ELLs to express themselves through artistic expression which 
also furthers their oral language development. ELL students are also members of the Student Council where they need to 
partake in classrooms debates and solve conflicts. Our ELLs also participate in our K- Kids team. In this team our ELLs 
participate in various community social issues. Our second grade and fifth grade dual language students participated in the 
Math Bee and Spelling Bee in Spanish. We have after school programs which help further develop language skills and prepare 
students for standardized tests. We also offer Enrichment opportunities to further Literacy skills for our ELLs through our Title 
III funding for After school programs. Our ELLs attend the Title III Summer in the City program,  where they participate in the 
summer enrichment opportunities to continue acquiring English. The school invites ELLs to participate in all school programs 
by sending home parent permission requests in both English and in the child’s parents requested language of communication, 
if possible. All students are included in special school activities such as Chorus, Art Squad and Tech Team to name a few.  Our 
ELLs are invited to our Title III after school program for support in language development as well as  ELA and NYSESLAT 
preparation. Our ELLs fully participate in all special programs because they are all offered the opportunity to join. They are also 
highlighted and useful as guides for others, who may speak less English than them and also those who are strong artistically 
can show off their skills without having to worry so much about English. 
 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
 Our school utilizes various instructional materials to support our ELL population. Our school uses the Teachers College 
approach. Our teachers are given different kinds of books to teach each unit. For our kindergarten through second grade 
teachers provide phonics instructions through Fundations and Words Their Ways. Our ENL teachers  use Rigby-Activate 
Learning big books. These big books help the teachers in Shared Reading which is a technique that involves all the children 
from early emergent to proficient readers, to read together while the teacher is scaffolding the language. Shared reading 
encourages language use. As Scott & Ytreberg (1990) say, “When children start learning English, they need to be given the 
language before they can produce it themselves.” Our teachers use a large variety of different genre books for Read Alouds. 
Oral language development becomes a standard as the children begin to have conversations about the book being read. Our 
ENL teachers use Gay Su Pinnell Guided Reading lessons by using leveled reading materials to support the reader at each level. 
Exploring Non-Fiction by Time For Kids which gives the children an opportunity to explore and learn about non fiction with real 
photographs and graphic organizers.  For Social Studies we use Multicultural Celebrations by Modern Curriculum Press and for 
Science we use the STEM program. Stem allows for the opportunity to explore and learn about science, technology, 
engineering and math. ELLs participate in hands on activities and utilize technology to enhance their language skills. One 
website, ABC Mouse.com has been very helpful in assisting  our ELL students in the entering and emerging stages to acquire 
basic English skills, while also learning phonics and reading. Our entering and emerging , as well as transitioning, expanding and 
commanding ELLs also benefit from our use of Reading- A-Z.com. Teachers are able to access books for guided reading support 
and content area support in English as well as Spanish on this site. Our ELL students in Entering through Expanding Proficiency 
are given access to dictionaries that are in their native language to support their acquisition of English. 
 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

   Our Dual Language and Bilingual Programs are designed to continue developing ELLs native language, as well as English 
Language skills. The English Proficient speaking students learn to become bilingual through linguistic role models, interaction 
and language development in both languages. There are content area curriculum books in Spanish as well as leveled library 
books and guided reading books. In ENL, we provide books and dictionaries in several languages to help support our ELLs and 
help them feel more confident. We use these books to compare and contrast our various cultures during content area 
instruction or whenever necessary. For our incoming Spanish speaking students, we administer the Spanish Lab-R to assess the 
students' proficiency in Spanish.    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

 Our ELL students in both DL and ENL are provided with support services and resources that correspond to ELLs' ages and grade 
levels. We have literature and leveled books available in the students native languages that are equivalent to their English 
materials. Students are provided with supports that will help them  feel more comfortable and secure in their classrooms. An 
example of these materials are dictionaries in the students native language and English to support their vocabulary/language 
development. There are content area curriculum books available in Spanish for Math. A variety of of books in different 
languages are kept in baskets in the ENL classrooms for students to read. Our ELLs are in classes and groups where they receive 
support  services that correspond to their age and grade levels as noted above. 
   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Currently, PS 22  does not share a building (co-location). In the event that we would have to share our building we would share 
materials and resources as needed and would consult with a co-located school as to best practices. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
 P.S. 22  staff welcomes our newly enrolled ELLs by providing them with orientation about the school and programs we offer at 
school. Newly enrolled students are provided with a school package which offers vital information about our school. Our 
PTA team, and our parent coordinator, Kim Bonabentura coordinate incoming kindergarten orientation meetings late in 
June. In this orientation parents are informed of all school policies, and school events. Our staff provides school tours, and 
informational meetings in the summer to explain the various programs when requested. New Ells are invited to attend our 
Enrichment Summer School Program from July to August. All these meetings are provided with the use of interpreters if 
needed. Mrs. DVicente, Mrs. Passarelli and Mrs. Fahmy ensure that  new Ells feel welcomed and supported while adjusting to 
our school culture. The Ell teachers pair up students with other students who speak their native language. As our ELLs 
transition to Middle Schools, our Parent coordinator, Kim Bonaventura, provides parents with all pertaining information 
regarding dates and open house for middle schools in a timely fashion. All parent letters and documents are translated into 
parents native language.  
If newly enrolled ENL students are having a difficult time transitioning to a new school and culture, Ms. Erika Lisiewski, Ms. 
Deborah Santamaria or Mr. Brian Landano, our school guidance counselors are available to pick up students in small groups for 
at risk counseling and to teach  students transition and social skills to become more comfortable in their new classes. 
One way we support our ELLs as they prepare to move  on to middle school, is we have our fifth grade classes departmentalize 
to model a structure in place in middle school.  We teach our students how to ask for help when confused and to find peers 
that are friendly and helpful that they can work with in classes.  We have shown them in the past how to use online translators 
for native language support. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

             Currently PS 22 does not offer language electives to our ELLs. However, our ENL teachers provide a library with a 
variety of books in different languages so that students are able to read in their native language.Some of our English speaking 
students are learning Spanish in our Dual Language Program.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

  
 a.Our kindergarten, first grade  and second grade dual language program follows the side by side model. 
Our dual language teachers provide instruction in a ratio of 50% English instruction and 50% Spanish 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

instruction. Our third and 4th  grade dual language follow a single teacher  roller coaster model. Our dual 
language teachers provide instruction one day in English the next day in Spanish. b. All dual 
language classes are taught the core content areas in both English and Spanish depending on which 
language day it is. Content areas are taught in both languages using books in leveled libraries in both 
languages. c. In all dual language classes, the language is separated every other day. One full day is 
Spanish instruction followed by one full day in English instruction. d. Emergent literacy is taught 
simultaneously depending on the day. One day the instruction is taught in English and the following day 
the instruction is in Spanish. 
 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 
            As per CR Part 154 new mandates, P.S.22 ensure that all teachers, administrators/assistant principals, 
school secretaries, teachers that address the needs of ELLs. Our parent coordinator attend, professional development related 
to language acquisition and academic language instruction. Our ENL teachers participate in meaningful workshops and 
meetings as well as various conferences on ENL instruction throughout the year. Some of the workshops our teachers have 
attended are:

PS 22  provides PD for our teachers of ELLs as they prepare ELL students to learn in the content areas by having the ENL 
teachers along with teachers of ELLs attend PD for ELL strategies that are offered by the Office of English Language Learners, 
Teachers College, and also through the After School Professional Development Program. These teachers who attend the PD 
can also turnkey the information and strategies to other staff during the school day, on Professional Development days, and 
also during the Professional Development time on Mondays. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
   As mandated per CR part 154.2, professional development is provided throughout the year to all our staffs, all our staff 
attend a total of 15% of total hours of PD related to English Language Learners.  All our ENL and Bilingual teachers receive 50% 
of total hours of professional development which specifically addresses the needs of English language learners. Our Teachers 
attend Teacher College workshops geared towards language acquisition, best practices and strategies for Ells. Our teachers of 
ELLs have received  intensive training with Mrs. Maryann Cucchiara whose main focus is rigor in academic language and close 
reading strategies for our Ells. Our ENL teachers maintain a binder with agendas and attendance on all workshops attended. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Parental Involvement   
  
  1. Our school provides annual individual meetings with parents of ELLS to discuss goals, students' progress and language 
development needs. Our ENL teachers invite all parents to attend a meeting regarding their child's progress and how to further 
assist at home. These meetings are usually conducted during parent time on Tuesdays. Our teachers keep record of these 
meetings. Our school provides interpretation services.  
  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
   At PS 22 there are many opportunities for our ELL parents to get involved in their child's education. Our ENL teachers arrange 
individual meetings with parents to discuss their child's progress and goals. At PS 22, every Tuesday afternoon are dedicated to 
parents. Our ENL teachers invite parents to discuss individual students growth and needs. Our ENL teachers invited parents via 
translated letters in their native language. In addition to that, teachers of ELLs invite parents to attend various workshops 
throughout the year. ENL teachers offered a NYSESLAT workshop in which parents have the opportunity to become informed 
about the different tests. In cooperation with our PTA and the Y After-School Program we hold Parent Engagement Project 
Events (PEP) every other month. This event provides families an opportunity to enjoy dinner, PTA meeting and to attend 
workshops. At these workshops, parents  learn about ways to help their children at home. Teachers and other staff are 
available at these workshops to translate vital information in the families native language. Every time ENLteachers have 
meetings with parents, they make sure interpreters are available to assist in their native language.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Melissa Lamb Donath, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

PS 22 ensures that ELL parents and our school community maintain good communication in all parents native 
languages. The school reviews ATS reports such as RHLA and RCLP to determine the native language spoken by 
our parents. The School also uses the information written on the Home Language Survey provided by our parents 
upon registration. Our school parent coordinator, Kim Bonaventura creates and updates a tally chart of our 
parents different languages to ensure that documents to be sent are translated accordingly. Mrs. Bonaventura 
also sends surveys home to identify parents in need of translation for Back to School Family Night, Parent Teacher 
conferences, kindergarten registration, ENL orientation meetings, and for any other activities and workshops in 
the school. Our school ensures that documents to be sent to parents are translated into our parents' respective

Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

At the beginning of each school year, Mrs. Donath, our principal, distributes a copy of the Chancellor's Regulation A-
663 to all school staff to ensure that Limited English Speaking parents are provided with a meaningful opportunity to 
participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education. Mrs. Bonaventura shares

PS 22 fulfills Section VII fo Chancellor's Regulation A-663 regarding parental notification requirements for translation 
and interpretation services. Our secretary generates reports ATS reports which indicate preferred languages for 
parents in our school. In the school lobby, there are posters and signs in different languages. Our staff accommodates 
our multicultural community whenever it's needed. Mrs. Bonaventura, our Parent coordinator provides a bulletin 
board with parental information in the different languages of our school. She also sets up a table displaying 
brochures, fliers and other important information in different languages. Our school lobby near the primary entrance 
displays signs in each of the covered languages, or most prominent covered languages, indicating the availability of 
interpretation services.When a parent visits our school and requests translation, the parent coordinator places a call 
to the NCYDOE translation Unit and parents are able to communicate on the spot. Parents are informed of their rights 
to receive translated documents in their native language and to receive interpretation services when visiting our 
school. Parents are informed to visit  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

PS 22 gathers feedback from parents on the quality and availability of translation and interpretation services by asking 
them to fill out a parent survey, provided to them in their native language. Parent surveys are taken into 
consideration to further inform and assist them in their preferred language.
