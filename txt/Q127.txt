Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

At PS/IS 127 we work collaboratively to promote the social and emotional growth of all students and cultivate self-
motivated lifelong learners who are college and career ready. Through the use of rigorous curriculum aligned with 
Next Generation Standards, all staff members will encourage student engagement and close the achievement gap.

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
P.S.I.S. 127Q Aerospace and Science Academy, located in the welcoming neighborhood of East Elmhurst, New York, is 
an inspiring school that serves a diverse student body from countries around the world, with students speaking more 
than twelve different languages. Our instructional programs are student-centered, differentiated, driven by the Next 
Generations Learning standards while adapting to the Next Generation Learning Standards and created to meet the 
individual needs of our learners.  

Our school offers a number of extracurricular and enrichment opportunities such as an award-winning chorus, 
participation in Disney Musicals in Schools, a dance residency with Flamenco Vivo Carlota Santana for English 
Language Learners and Students with Disabilities, an after school Arts and Literacy program for students in grades 6-8, 
the New York Junior Tennis League after school for students in grades 2-5, an advisory program for students in grades 
6-8, the Sanford Harmony Social-Emotional Learning Program, and various clubs catering to the interest and needs of 
our students. 

 

P.S./I.S. 127Q supports and encourages learning for all members of our school community. This not only includes 
students but also their parents, families and school staff. The parent coordinator works closely with families by 
offering workshops and programs to better equip the parents to help their children. We also offer programs to help 
engage the community in the education and success of our student population. We strive to meet the needs of our 
students who are at risk of not meeting NGLS standards through a number of staff-directed programs. These 
programs are student-centered and reflect the individual needs of at-risk students.  

The Principal, Assistant Principals and teachers servicing ELLs have been given the opportunity to attend various 
professional development seminars and workshops, since so much of the school population is learning English as a 
New Language (ENL). These teachers then turnkey what they have learned and share best practices with other staff 
members. This teacher collaboration helps to ensure the success of our school’s growing ELL population. In addition 
to a free-standing ENL program, our school also offers a Spanish dual language and transitional bilingual program. The 
dual language program offers students the unique opportunity to be taught literacy and content in both their native 
language and English; this helps create students who are bilingual, bi-literate, and who will ultimately have high levels 
of academic success in two languages. 

Our School Leadership Team (SLT) is working to strengthen our family-community ties and increase parent and 
community involvement in all aspects of life here at P.S./I.S. 127Q. The School Leadership Team works together with 
other members of the staff to create opportunities for our parents and students to get involved in a variety of events.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

31.34% of the students attending P.S./I.S. 127 are English Language Learners (ELLs). The needs of these students are 
met through the parent's choice of either a Spanish Dual Language Class, a Spanish Transitional Bilingual Class or an 
English as a New Language (ENL) Class. 14.66% of the school population qualify for Special Education Services. Over 
the past few years we have found that these subgroups of students have not demonstrated the same rate of 
academic proficiency as other subgroups, resulting in not making adequate yearly progress. As a result, we have 
worked to strengthen our instructional core by including Advance Literacy practices.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

According to the Quality Review Report (2017-2018),our area of celebration was QR indicator (3.4). According to the 
report, it states that school leaders convey high expectations for instruction to staff through professional 
development workshops and through written communication, such as the “Instructional Essentials,” that reflects the 
Danielson Framework for Teaching. School leaders communicate high expectations to families that are connected to 
college and career readiness. Impact School leaders consistently communicate high expectations to the school

community, providing training and a system of accountability to ensure those expectations are met. School leaders 
and staff offer ongoing feedback to help families understand student progress toward those expectations. 

According to the Quality Review Report(2017-2018), our area of focus was QR indicator (4.2). The report states," The 
majority of teachers are engaged in vertical or grade band professional collaborations and consistently analyze 
assessment data and student work. However, the data were not always systematically analyzed through the use of a 
protocol to unpack student data."

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
On the 2017-2018 Quality Review Report, our school was rated proficient in the following QR 
indicators:1.4,3.4,1.3,3.1,4.1,4.2, and 5.2 

On the School Quality Guide (2017-2018), 98% of teachers stated that the professional staff believes that all students 
can learn, including English language learners (ELL) and students with disabilities. (Q6a) 

Upon reviewing the School Quality Snapshot (2016-2017) we noticed that 33% of the students met standards on the 
English state test and 24% of the students met standards in the Math state test.  

In consideration of these data sources,it was determined that there was a need for teachers to continue 
collaboratively customize curriculum planning to improve instructional practices. In addition, we will continue to 
incorporate Advance Literacy across all subject areas to support the diverse needs of our students.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

During the 2018-2019 school year, teacher teams will 
collaboratively customize curriculum to include academic 
vocabulary(Hallmark 2 of Advanced Literacy Skills) based on 
administrative feedback. Teachers meet twice a month on 
Mondays for 80 minutes to analyze student work and teachers 
meet once a week for 45 minutes during their common planning 
time.  

During the 2018-2019 school year, administration will provide 
teachers with feedback related to component 1e (obs) and 
domain 3, based on observations conducted throughout the 
school year. 

 

During the 2018-2019 school year, all teachers will provide 
parents with grade wide expectations regarding the curriculum. 
They will equip the parents with strategies and guidance to 
support the needs of their child(ren) at home. This includes 
sharing a variety of resources and modeling ways in which 
parents can interact with their child(ren) within the context of 
Advanced Literacy skills, in an effort to improve their 
achievement level. 

Teachers will attend targeted Professional Learning 
Opportunities and turn key strategies and instructional practices 
to other teachers in order to customize the curriculum aligned 
with the Hallmarks of Advanced Literacy for all students .

Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
In conducting a comprehensive needs assessment, the following data sources were considered and findings noted: 

  OORS Reports (SY 17-18) – 140 Total 

o  Level 1 – 11 
o  Level 2 – 14 
o  Level 3 – 42 
o  Level 4 –68 
o  Level 5 – 5 
o  Measure of Teacher Practice Detail Report – School Year 2017-2018 

  97% of teachers across grades K-8 were rated Effective or Highly Effective each observation within the 

Danielson Framework for Teaching Domain 2 – The Classroom Environment.  

Based on the analyzed data sources, it was determined that efforts to incorporate additional supports across all 
stakeholders groups should be utilized in order to decrease the number of student incidents that require entering a 
report into OORS.  

In addition, it was determined that the school will implement tiered behavioral intervention. Taking this action will 
ensure that students who are at-risk receive the support needed.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, the school will continue to identify and develop behavioral interventions for students and provide them 
with appropriate social-emotional supports that meets their individual needs and ensures success in performance 
resulting in a 5% decrease in the number of student incidents as measured by the Online Occurrence Reporting 
System reports.

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

Upon conducting a comprehensive needs assessment, the following data sources were considered and findings noted: 

Quality Review(2017-2018) 

Quality Indicator 3.4 (High Expectations) was rated Proficient and also identified as an area of celebration.  

Findings: 

School leaders convey high expectations for instruction to staff through professional development workshops and 
through written communication such as the "Instructional Essentials", that reflect the Danielson Framework for 
Teaching. School leaders communicate high expectations to families that are connect to college and career readiness.  

Impact: 

School leaders consistently communicate high expectations to the school community, providing training and a system 
of accountability to ensure those expectations are met. School leaders and staff offer ongoing feedback to help 
families understand student progress toward those expectations.  

Quality Indicator 4.2 (Teacher Teams and Leadership Development) was rated Proficient, but also deemed the Area of 
Focus.  

Findings: 

The majority of teachers are engaged in vertical or grade band professional collaborations and consistently analyze 
assessment data and student work. However, the data were not always systematically analyzed through the use of a 
protocol to unpack student data. 

Impact 

Teacher teams are engaging in inquiry-based work that promotes the implementation of the Next Generation 
Learning Standards while preparing to adapt the Next Generation Learning standards. However, this work does not 
result in shared improvement in teacher practice, school wide instruction, and the mastery of goals for groups of 
students

Teacher leadership and inquiry practices have strengthened teacher instructional capacity although not coherently for 
all students’ achievement towards a level of mastery. Although structures are in place for teacher voice, they are not 
as yet embedded systemically where they play a primary role in strategic decisions. 

School Quality Snapshot (2016-2017) 

24% of students met standards on the Math state test.  

Based on the analyzed data sources, it was determined that teachers should focus on their ability to increase student 
achievement by utilizing multiple entry points to support mathematics instruction.

Section 6: Academic Intervention Services (AIS)  

(Required for All Schools) 

  

Directions: Schools need to maintain accurate records of students who are receiving Academic Intervention Services 
(AIS) to ensure that students who are not achieving proficiency receive effective and timely assistance. These records 
need to be made available upon request and indicate the total number of students receiving AIS in each subject area 
listed below and for each applicable grade in your school.

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS/IS 127Q, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and of students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. 

 

P.S./I.S. 127Q will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

● providing materials and information to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, 
e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision making in 
support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress. P.S./I.S.127Q has planned events to encourage and foster parent support and participation – 
information regarding the high school application process presented by the Guidance Counselor, support and 
educational information, safety meeting and New York State Testing meeting, awards nights, Family Literacy Nights, 
and District 30 Town Hall Meetings.  

● providing information to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand 

● Academic Outreach: assist parental involvement in students’ academic progression, P.S./I.S.127Q holds three 
Parent/Teacher Conferences during the school year in the months of November, March and May. To enhance 
understanding of the expanse of the curriculum as well as academic course requirements, we schedule a “Meet the 
Teacher” for parents during which they meet the faculty at the onset of the school year and learn about expectations 
of the faculty and demands of the curriculum. This is an opportunity for families to familiarize themselves with the 
curriculum for that year. This will help parents assist their child(ren) to achieve academic success. Faculty members 
also communicate and/or meet with families on Tuesday afternoons to update them on learning expectations and 
academic performance. Parents are invited in for a fourth Parent/Teacher Conference in May to celebrate the 
learning and academic successes of their child(ren) throughout the year.  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 
To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents such as the School Leadership Team, the Parent Association 
(or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support and ongoing 
professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;

school and families. The Parent Coordinator will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent 
Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the 
central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, assessment expectations, literacy, accessing community and support services, and technology

P.S./I.S.127Q Title III program provides ELLs with supplemental instruction in an ELL After 
School and Saturday Program . Our programs will service students in grades 3-8.The ELL After 
School Program will meet  from 2:30pm to 4:30pm on Wednesdays and Thursdays beginning 
November 28, 2018 through March 28, 2019 . The Saturday Academy will meet from 9:00am to 
12:00pm on Saturdays beginning January 12, 2019 through May 18, 2019. Group size will be 
maintained at 15-20 students per teacher in order to ensure that students receive individualized 
instruction. Teachers will be certified in ENL or hold a bilingual extension. 
 
This program will focus on ENL methodologies, and literacy in order to help students who are at 
risk meet Citywide Instructional Expectations and New York State Next Generation Standards. 
In addition, instruction will also be provided on test taking strategies and address the 4 
modalities of the NYSESLAT. Appropriate materials such as textbooks and teacher's guide will 
be purchased for this program - these materials are different than the materials that are utilized 
during the school day. Materials will include workbooks and teachers guides from Continental 
Press "Finish Line for ELLS 2.0" and teacher created resources. In addition, (students’ 
workbooks, teachers’ guide, textbooks, dictionaries, paper, pencils, atlas, globes, videos, 
notebooks and pens) that may be needed will be provided to all students and teachers. 
 
From analyzing a myriad amount of data sources (local and state), which includes the EDAT, 
New York State Examinations, it was noted the number of students who scored proficiency grew 
by 7% in NYS ELA and 3% in NYS Math. Although there was an overall growth in the number 
of proficient students, our Limited English Proficiency (LEP)/English Language Learners 
(ELLs) had limited growth in the NYS Examimations. 
 
Further analysis of the New York State English Language Arts and Mathematics Examinations 
demonstrated an upward trend for students achieving levels 3 and 4, with a stronger 
improvement and overall performance on the New York State English Language Arts 
Examination. However, each proficiency level remains below 30%, which means that the 
majority of students in the building are achieving proficiency levels of 1 or 2. 
That stated, we thought it necessary as a school to focus our program on literacy and math with a 
focus in English language development since all other intellectual powers depend on it. 
Lastly, it is important to note that the Bilingual/ENL Coordinator will house all student 
attendance and program notification sent to parents' in the preferred language. We currently have 
a central location where all these materials are housed.

Begin description here:            
P.S./I.S.127Q  will  provide differentiated professional development for all ENL teachers 
through cyclical session. Teachers will be provided with knowledge about second language 
acquisition, customization of curriculum along with a deeper understanding of the content.  
 
As a school, we strive to engage our teacher in the work of action research. We anticipate that 
teachers will leave each professional development session with new strategies/techniques and 
tools that they will implement into their practice. These sessions we believe will provide ongoing 
opportunities for ENL educators so that they will continue to improve their knowledge which 
will impact student achievement. We believe that when educators learn, students learn more. 
 
As such, professional development will take place every two other Mondays from 2:30pm -
3:35pm. We are working on partnering with organizations such as local colleges, UFT Teacher 
Center, NYC DOE Mental Health, Sharzer and Brainpower to provide professional 
development. For the 2018-2019 school year we will focus on Advanced Literacy Hallmark 3: 
Extended writing as we continue building strategies from Hallmarks 1 and 4 which were the 
focus during the 2017-18 school year. To support the staff and students' -social emotional needs, 
teachers are being trained in Brainpower. Also, we continue training our teachers in Move-to-
improve. Last but not least, all teachers are trained in using iReady. Our ENL teachers attend the 
Queens North Field Support Office professional development sessions focused on ENL 
strategies.

P.S./I.S.127Q Title III program will provide ELL parents with family literacy and language 
acquisition classes to improve their listening, speaking, reading and writing skills in English. The 
Parent Coordinator will support in identifying workshops that would benefit our parents. It is 
important to note that there will be an emphasis on the use of technology, mock job interviews, 
developing resumes and English in the workplace.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
When deciding on the focus of the program, we utilized informal data such a conversation with 
parents to determine their needs.  
Classes will be taught by Bilingual/ENL teachers. There will be a total of two classes serving 
approximately 60 parents on Saturdays from 9:00 am until 12:00pm starting January 12, 2019 
through May 18, 2019. Textbooks, bilingual dictionaries and general supplies will be purchased 
for this program.  
For all parent workshops, parents are notified about these programs through letters, phone 
messages and  phone calls. We work relentlessly to ensure that messages are sent to parents in 
their native language. As such, we utilize in-house personnel as well as NYC DOE translation 
and interpretation services  to assist parents with translation.  We typically contract translators in 
the event that we do not have a staff member who is fluent in the parent's home language along 
with the  NYC DOE translation and interpretation unit in order to provide the translation 
services. 
The ENL/Bilingual Coordinator will maintain all attendance records including agendas and 
invitation to parent in parent's preferred languages.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
At P.S.127, we use the Fountas and Pinnell assessment,school designed common writing assessment and Ready NY CCLS-ELA 
assessments (grades 2-8 ) to assess the literacy skills of all students. Teachers administer these  assessment in the months of 
September, January and May. These  assessment help teachers  determine students independent as well as instructional 
reading levels .In addition, this data is aggregated and analyzed with teacher teams as part of the inquiry process. As 
such,teachers are able to identify the gaps in student learning and create data driven plans for each child. 
 
 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

To support teachers with analyzing student work, administration has established deadlines to collect and analyze student data. 
Additionally, for the upcoming school year, administrators will engaged in data driven conferences with teachers to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

discuss class and grade level data. Administrators and teachers will work collaboratively to  create a plan of action to support 
students who are not making adequate gain. 
 
Teachers will also engage in inquiry. Inquiry will be held on selected Mondays during the school year. On these Mondays, 
administrators and teachers will work collaboratively to detect the learner center problem and determine appropriate next 
steps. 
  
As a school, we have also created  non-negotiable regarding  instructional practices. For example,teachers  are required 
to customize the prescribed curriculum to meet the needs of students. Teachers are provided with the "127Q Instructional 
Essentials" which is aligned to the Danielson Framework for Teaching which is a tool that should be utilized when planning 
instruction for students. 
  
 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
  We evaluate the success of our program for ELLs by using a myriad of data sources. For example, we utilize the  NYSESLAT 
Exam, the New York State English Language Arts Exam,Ready NY CCLS-ELA (grades 2-8)assessment,school designed writing 
common assessment and the Fountas and Pinnell assessment. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

As a school, we make every attempt to provide students with targeted support and intervention. For example, upon reviewing 
the summative data, students are grouped strategically in their classrooms and receive small group intervention. Taking this 
action provides students with the opportunity to receive tailored instruction and feedback at their appropriate level. 
 
In addition to small group instruction, selected students receive AIS students. Given the number of students who require 
support, we structure our after school programs to also provide additional support for students. For example,we strategically 
select students for the different programs.For example, students who are excelling in the NYSESLAT but are not excelling on 
the NYS ELA examination are invited to our Saturday Program. In our Saturday Program, we utilize the IReady program and 
explicitly teach testing taking strategies and academic vocabulary to students. It should be noted that this program also infuses 
the Arts to ensure that students are able to apply their understanding of the content. 
 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
   
Our school is constantly analyzing data for all subgroups.We do this through the use of formative assessments(exit 
tickets),interim assessments and  summative assessments. The data that we collect inform the decisions made in and out of 
the classroom. If we realize that a student is struggling with a concept after a lesson,the teacher's first step is to re teach this 
concept using a different strategy. If this does not yield the anticipated results, the teacher then consults with a coach, mentor 
or a critical friend to see if there is another approach that can be used.  
  
In teacher teams, our teachers analyze, and identify strategies and tactics needed to move  children to the next level.Teachers 
come to these analysis meetings with the children assessment in their hands. 
  
That stated,if students are still not making adequate gains,our next step is to have these student work in small groups . 
Reducing the class size typically yields  significant growth. If this approach does not work our next steps is usually to place this 
child in RTI tier 3. 
  
An example of what RTI looks like in our school 
RTI:Tier 1  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

Sheltered Instruction Techniques utilized: For example, the teacher may scaffolding language by paraphrasing key words, 
providing opportunities to extend answers, supporting language by using familiar synonyms (e.g., “that is also like…”) and 
familiar antonyms (e.g., “that is also different from…”), re framing students' responses, confirming aspects of the answer that 
are correct, and providing language supports to further explain aspects that require refinement. 
RTI:Tier 2  
Guided Reading: Teachers provide intensive reading interventions to ELLs demonstrating low reading skills immediately when 
needed. Teachers ensure that interventions are sufficiently intense by retaining small groups (3–6 students) who are provided 
intervention for a minimum of 30 minutes each day. 
  
RTI:Tier 3 
Intervention is provided by a highly qualified teacher who uses a different research based program with the students.    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
As stated above,our school has established benchmark assessments that we utilize to measure success. For our ELLs, we utilize 
the NYSITELL,NYSESLAT, F&P assessment, school designed writing common assessment and Ready NY CCLAS-ELA (grades 2-8). 
 
The NYSITELL and NYSESLAT data (RLAT report in ATS) is used for programming our students to make sure they are receiving 
mandated services as per CR Part 154.  
 
Additionally we use the EDAT data is used to select students for our Title III  after-school program. In addition,this data is 
shared with all teachers in our building. Teachers utilize this data to customize instructions.  
 
We also utilize this data when planning professional development workshops for all ENL teachers.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Information regarding  the progress of our ELLs, is share in the following manner: 
 
-Chancellor Conference Day: In the beginning of the school year, administrators share information with the staff regarding  the 
rate of success/lack of success of different subgroups. Administrators outlined the instructional focus/initiate that will be 
implement to support these students. 
 
-Data Conference: Administrators will meet with their teachers after data collection day to discuss trends in each teacher's 
classroom. Teachers and administrators will create a plan of action to support students who are not meeting expectations and 
standards. 
 
-Inquiry Meetings: Teacher teams meet and discuss the trends in each classroom along with the subgroups that are not making 
significant progress 
 
 
-Breakfast with the Principal: The principal shares information regarding the progress of our school with parents during this 
time. This includes an overview regarding different subgroups academic progress in our school. 
 
-Parent Conference: Teachers communicate students progress during selected Tuesdays.

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

 
 
Self-Contained ENL 
In the Kindergarten, first,  second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth grade levels we offer self-contained ENL classes taught 
by certified ENL teachers. The students in these classes are at all proficiency levels (EN, EM, TR, EX, and CM) according 
to their NYSITELL and/or NYSESLAT scores. They receive ENL and/or ELA instruction according to the CR Part 154 
regulations. Students at the Entering and Emerging levels receive at least 360 minutes per week of ENL instruction 
(180 standalone and 180 integrated), and Transitioning and Expanding level students receive at least 180 minutes per 
week of ENL instruction. FELLs are given 90 minutes of ENL support per week for the first two years after exiting the 
ENL program. Required instructional time is achieved through flexible grouping and differentiated instruction. The 
teachers of these classes also implement ENL methodologies into their lessons. They also modify the curriculum 
programs as needed to suit the various levels of their students. A great emphasis is placed on developing social 
language as well as academic language to meet the Common Core standards. This setting will help bridge the gap 
between the student’s English language proficiency level and the level of the curriculum. 
  
Push-In ENL 
     Our special education ELLs in grades Kindergarten through eight  who are in ICT or 12:1:1 classes receive ENL 
services by licensed ENL teachers.  Also children in General Education settings who are eligible for services receive ENL 
push in service.These students are serviced in a push-in setting. The students are served as per their IEPs. If an ELL 
student in an ICT or 12:1:1 class has an IEP that states bilingual instruction and the ICT teachers do not have a 
bilingual certification, we provide these students with a language paraprofessional.  Students at the Entering and 
Emerging levels receive at least 360 minutes per week of ENL instruction (180 standalone and 180 integrated), and 
Transitioning and Expanding level students receive at least 180 minutes per week of ENL instruction. FELLs are given 
90 minutes of ENL support per week for the first two years after exiting the ENL program as per CR Part 154. Required 
instructional time is achieved through flexible grouping and differentiated instruction.  Push-in ENL services are 
delivered by permanently licensed ENL teachers. By having these students in a mainstream class they can work side 
by side with native speakers of English. In grades Kindergarten through second the Fountas and Pinnel LLI (Leveled 
Literacy Instruction) Program is used by our ELL service provider to develop literacy skills such as reading 
comprehension, oral reading accuracy rate and writing.  Our ENL service providers,utilize the stand alone and 
integrated models when working with their students.  
  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A  
  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

 
Dual Language :K-8 
     This year we have expanded the Dual language program into the grade 8. Our Dual language classes are taught by 
certified bilingual teachers. The students in these classes include ELLs and English Proficient students. We have 
implemented a 50/50 model in which all students are instructed in English for 50% of the instructional time and in 
Spanish for 50% of the instructional time. This is achieved by teaching one day entirely in Spanish, and then entirely in 
English the following day. This pattern continues with the alternating languages on a daily basis. The ReadyGen 
(grades K-2)  and  Expeditionary Learning (grades 3-8)  programs are used in Spanish and English on alternating days 
during the literacy block for both reading and writing. Go Math is used in English and in Spanish on alternating days. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

The NYC Harcourt Science program is used on English days and the NYC Harcourt Ciencias program is used on Spanish 
days. The NYCDOE Passport to Social Studies program is also used in English and Spanish on alternating days. The 
preview-review strategy is used to make input comprehensible. In the preview phase the teacher presents content in 
the native language on the first day and then in the second language on the second day. The content is then reviewed 
in the student's native language with an emphasis on comprehension.  
 
DL classes receive at lease one period (45-50 minutes) of HLA instruction per week. 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

     
The organization of our staff ensures the mandated number of instructional minutes are provided according to the proficiency 
levels  in our ENL, and dual language programs. Our ELL population continues to grow each year and we take this into 
consideration during the hiring process by continuously seeking highly qualified ENL and bilingual common branch teachers. 
We partner with universities such as St. John's, and utilize the New York City Department of Education open market hiring 
system and the Teach For America system that allows us to post vacancies by license area, and receive resumes from qualified 
applicants. We also encourage our current staff to obtain ENL and bilingual licenses through programs such as the Intensive 
Teaching Institute (ITI). Our self contained ENL classes are taught by dually licensed ENL/Common branch teachers. Our Dual 
language classes are taught by dually licensed bilingual/early childhood teachers. The schedules of these classes are designed 
by making it a priority to program the mandated minutes of ENL, ELA and HLA before anything else is programmed. In other 
words, these areas are built into the teacher's program. For example,all of the Dual Language classes receive one block per 
week of HLA instruction. We believe that the more   literate students are in the home language, the stronger and 
more expedient their transition to academic English proficiency. 
 
Standalone ENL instruction is typically delivered during the Small Group Instructional period of each ELA period. 
 
The languages of instruction spoken by our cluster teachers such as art, music and physical education are also taken into 
consideration when making the schedules. ENL students in monolingual special education and ICT classes are provided with 
ENL push in services by a licensed ENL teacher. Students at the beginner and intermediate levels receive 360 minutes per week 
of ENL instruction, and advanced level students receive 180 minutes a week of ENL instruction as well as 180 minutes of ELA 
instruction. Schedules are created for push in teachers with priority placed on meeting the number of mandated minutes in 
ENL and in ELA.  In addition, we plan on noting in the schedules whether the period is for standalone ENL or integrated ENL. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
    We utilize the NYSESLAT along with the NYSITELL proficiency levels in order to provide appropriate instruction for all 
students.  
  
   During the integrated (EN,EM,TR,EX,CM) and stand alone (EN,EM) models of ENL instruction in ELA and content areas 
,teachers are encourage to adhere to the following structures in their lessons: 
1 .Create a hook before teaching: During the lesson introduction, we suggest that teachers begin with an engaging activity 
that  involves students interest 
2. Build background knowledge: We challenge all teachers to build schema for our students before teaching the material.We 
believe that words alone on a page will not hold meaning for students in the early stages of language acquisition therefore we 
recommend that our teachers use videos,visuals etc in order for students to connect  with the content. 
3.Vocabulary Development: Teacher select words that merits review to explicitly teach before beginning a unit/lesson. When 
teaching these words we recommend that teachers match actions with words to convey meaning(multi-sensory approach). In 
addition,teachers should show students how to use these words and give students the opportunity to use these words.

4.Limit teacher to student talk: We also advice that teachers prepare questions that provoke a provocative class discussion  for 
all students. By pre planning these questions,this allows for an authentic conversation to take place between students and 
support the thinking process of our students. We believe that this will then transfer over to supporting our students with 
writing because the prerequisite skill for writing is thinking.  
5.Provide feedback: In order for our students to transcend their academic level,we  strongly believe  that teachers must give 
the gift of  daily feedback. Effective feedback is actionable,and specific.We believe that effective feedback from a teacher is 
what separates a beginner ELL student from an Advance ELL student. 
 
*Our school works actively to support teachers with implementing the gradual release of responsibility teaching model in the 
classroom. In addition, our school has created an Instructional Essentials guidance document that we encourage all teachers to 
utilize as we work toward meeting the demands of the CCLS.Lastly,our school takes the necessary steps needed to ensure that 
your teaching practices are aligned to the Blueprint for ELLs success * 
 
  
  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

      Evaluation in the native language 
We evaluate Spanish speaking ELLs in their  native language with the Spanish Lab shortly after registration. Classroom teachers 
and ELL providers also examine the reading and writing skills in the native language through reading and writing conferences. 
We evaluate the language abilities of the lower incidence language students by presenting them with sight words and simple 
writing tasks presented to them by staff members who are fluent in the specific language. Formal assessments are also used 
such as Fountas and Pinnell benchmark assessment, Estrellita assessment and the ELE Spanish exam. The results of these 
assessments are used to drive instruction in the native language. The results of all evaluations in the native languages are also 
shared with parents through conferences to determine the level and quality of previous schooling. 
 
 SIFE students are immediately identified through home language surveys, teacher reports and BESIS data collection. The 
school informs all teachers and providers that these students do not have adequate literacy or writing skills in their native 
language to transfer over to the target language. The assessments and methods used for them are adjusted accordingly. In 
many cases it is necessary to provide basic phonics and mathematics computation lessons to these students ; in addition to 
immersing students in content-area learning. Our SIFE students are also offered academic intervention services through our 
RTI providers and ICT cluster teacher. SIFE students receive priority placement in our Title III instructional program. In some 
cases a SIFE student with little to no formal education may be referred to a school within the district that has a bilingual 
program at the appropriate grade level.Newcomers in grades 6, 7, and 8 may be referred to IS 235, a middle school solely for 
newcomers. Upon completion of one school year, they can return to PS 127. Newcomers to PS 127 develop English language 
skills as they are immersed in content-area learning. Using scaffolds such as sheltered English, concrete materials, and prior 
knowledge, English language skills are taught through the content areas. The goal is to align English language learning with the 
content that is being taught in the classroom. This gives the students the support they need to participate fully in the 
classroom lessons. Since newcomers are tested in ELA after one year of being enrolled in an English Language School System, it 
is crucial that we use this short time period effectively. There is an emphasis on developing BICS (Basic Interpersonal 
Communication Skills) as rapidly as possible so that these students can begin to transition into learning academic language in 
English. Newcomers are also provided with support during the school day such as Stand-alone or Integrated push-in ENL, and 
academic interventions through AIS providers .

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

Due to our diverse learning community, our instruction always need to be differentiated.  Our ELL students have different 
languages, backgrounds, interests, styles of learning, reading levels and different degrees of skills and strategy mastery that 
necessitate a flexible approach to teaching varying content, process, and products.  Instruction for our SIFE students has been 
especially challenging for obvious reason.  By making an individualized student needs assessment, creating a data driven action 
plan that focuses on literacy and math and providing differentiation of instruction using grade appropriate instructional 
support and intensive native language support, these ELL students are achieving success. 
 
Teachers provide differentiated instruction to create learning opportunities that make allowances for differences in how 
individual students learn to ensure ENL students have access to important academic content. Content may be modified for 
students who need additional practice with essential elements before moving on; however, the expectation is that 
modifications will ultimately allow students to master the same key content. Our teachers differentiate based on content (the 
information and skills that students need to learn), process (how students make sense of the content being taught) or product 
(how students demonstrate what they have learned). 
 
Similarly,  newcomers are welcomed into our school and made to feel comfortable and secure.  Our  teachers implement the 
buddy system which pairs newly arrived ELLs with students who speak the same language and also serve as good English 
models.  Teachers create opportunities for our newcomers to listen to English and interact with other students in small groups 
as well as opportunities for newly arrived ELLs to participate in classroom projects that support language 
development.  Targeted academic intervention in ELA, mathematics, science and social studies during the school day, as well 
as after school, is also offered to our newcomers.  Newcomers are also encouraged to attend our after school  program 
where they receive additional support and make social connections.   
 
 Similarly, our instructional plan for ELLS receiving service 4 to 6 years involves intensive daily academic support.  Our 
Transitional Student Support Plan ensures that ELLs who pass the NYSESLAT receive testing accommodations and ELL support 
for up to two years.  Our plan for our Long Term ELLs involves creating individual needs assessments and creating a data driven 
plan that focuses on literacy and math.  Our plan for special education students involves collaboration between the ENL 
teacher, the classroom teacher and IEP teacher to ensure that all our special education ELLs are serviced as per their IEP and 
are receiving proper accommodations and modifications.  Furthermore, we seek to meet the needs of these students through 
inquiry-based curriculum and strong RTI structure.  Our inquiry team has been studying the needs of our struggling 
reading  students, looking closely at students with IEPs who have lost ground in the past year.  By understanding the 
challenges these students face, we will be bale to bridge the gaps. 
 
 
Former ELLs receive mandated services of 90 minutes using an integrated model within the content area each week.These 
services along with testing accommodations are mandated for 2 years after scoring proficient on the NYSESLAT or if they 
scored a 3 or 4 on the ELA and expanding on the NYSESLAT. Former ELLs  receive time and half when given an assessment. In 
addition,they also receive the following:  
  
Time extension (all exams): Schools may extend the test time for ELL students on NYS ELA and content-area assessments. 
Principals may use any reasonable extensions, such as "time and a half" (the required testing time plus half that amount), in 
accordance with their best judgment about the needs of the ELL students. Principals should consult with the student's 
classroom teacher in making these determinations. However, there are no time limits.  
 
• Separate location (all exams): Schools are encouraged to provide optimal testing environments and facilities for ELL students. 
NYS assessments may be administered to ELLs individually or in small groups in a separate location.  
 
• Third reading of listening selection (English Language Arts exams only): Proctors may read the listening passage three times 
to ELLs on grades 3-8 English Language Arts assessments. 
 
• Bilingual dictionaries and/or glossaries: ELLs may use bilingual glossaries when taking State examinations in all subjects 
except languages other than English exams (LOTE). The bilingual dictionaries and glossaries may provide only direct one-to-one 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

translations of words. Bilingual dictionaries and/or glossaries that provide definitions or explanations are not permitted. 
Bilingual glossaries in the content areas are available for downloading.  
 
• Simultaneous use of English and alternative language editions are not allowed for English Language Arts examinations. For 
state examinations for which SED provides written translations, ELLs may use both English and an alternative language edition 
of the test simultaneously. However, they should be instructed to record all of their responses in only one language. The 
alternative language edition used by the student should be so indicated on the student's answer sheet.  
 
• Oral translations for low incidence languages are not allowed for English Language Arts examinations. We provide ELL 
students with an oral translation of a state examination for the NYS MATH exam when there is no translated edition provided 
by SED. All translations must be oral, direct translations of the English editions. Written translations are not allowed. No 
clarifications or explanations may be provided.  
 
• Writing responses in the home language are not allowed for English Language Arts examinations. ELL students making use of 
alternative language editions or of oral translations of state examinations may write their responses to the open-ended 
question in their home languages.  
   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
  Our instructional approach support for ELL-SWD, includes time for students to practice what they are learning in mini-
lessons.  We are currently using Core Knowledge in the lower grades(K-2), and Expeditionary Learning(3rd-8th) standards-
based programs.These programs utilizes a variety of materials that integrate listening, speaking, reading and writing and foster 
critical thinking skills.  Furthermore, all our ELLs are provided with a variety of instructional strategies to assist them in 
the development of academic language and literacy.  The six major types of scaffolding – modeling, bridging, contextualization, 
schema building, text-representation and meta-cognition – are evident in all our classrooms.  Furthermore, our students 
experience the following consistent common teaching practices in all academic classrooms:  explicit learning targets, research-
based comprehensive strategies and discussion protocols for engaging in accountable talk.  
  
Technology used to support students: Brainpop ESL,Brainpop,Reading A-Z,Tumble books,Thinkcentral 
*Students are given access to the computer carts on each floor.  
  
Native Language Materials:  Most curriculum materials (Go Math, Harcourt Science and Social Studies -just examples of some 
of the materials ) are provided in each student's native language .Supplemental resources are also given to students. 
 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
ELLs identified as having special needs are in self-contained special education classes, Integrated Collaborative Teaching 
classes, or a SETTS program. Teachers and providers who work with these students are provided with a copy of the student’s 
IEP as per the Standard Operations Procedures Manual for Special Education. The instruction for these students is based on 
their data as well as their IEP goals. Programs such as Fountas and Pinnell and LLI are used with these students. Students with 
learning disabilities are instructed with strategies such as previewing and reviewing information in a text, hands-on activities in 
the content areas, visual and auditory aids, peer tutoring to build confidence and native language support through providing 
text in the native language. Our ELLs in special education also receive small group instruction as well as one on one instruction. 
We maximize the amount of time that our ELL-SWDs spend with non-disabled peers in a number of ways. Our Integrated 
Collaborative Teaching classes which are inclusion models, began at the Kindergarten level several years ago and now span 
from Kindergarten through grade six. The IEPs of our SWDs also state that they only require special education settings during 
the core subjects. This allows them to be with the general education students during music, art and gym as well as recess. Our 
school trips are also arranged by grade with special education and regular classes combined. In addition to these strategies our 
students with social or emotional disabilities are provided with counseling services through our 3 guidance counselors and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

Project Share worker. Positive behavior is reinforced through a school-wide system through our administrators, teachers, dean 
and SAVE room teachers.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
P.S.127 has a comprehensive academic intervention plan for all students, including English language learners.  Targeted 
intervention in literacy, math and science takes place throughout the school year by our classroom teachers, ENL providers and 
RTI providers. We currently have daily small group individualized instructional periods , which focuses on academic support 
skills,and includes a heavy emphasis on reading assessment and raising reading levels. In our classrooms  all students receive 
scaffolded reading support  from a teacher who documents their reading growth and provides them with concrete immediate 
feedback.  Furthermore, we  provide academic support to our ELL students by providing an after school program. The students 
are selected for after school program utilizing the EDAT at risk data.  
 
The use of two languages is utilized during standardized testing as a test accommodation. Children are allowed  
to use a bilingual dictionary. If necessary, ELL students have the test available in their native language as well.  
Explicit English as a Second Language (ENL) and ELA instruction is ongoing to meet the needs of our beginners,  
intermediate, and advanced students. ELL students will be instructed using the Core Knowledge and Expeditionary learning 
program in ELA,and the Go Math and Connected Math program in Math. These programs are designed for instruction in 
listening, speaking, reading, and writing in English specifically for the ELL population. The program is aligned with grade 
curriculum and the lessons provide differentiated instruction for every lesson. This program complies with State guidelines 
in ELL instruction. It teaches language using manipulatives, flashcards, audio, and charts to help develop language and build 
transitions to comfort levels.   
       
As a school we have incorporated  a variety instructional of strategies in accordance with ENL/ELA standards that will allow ELL 
students to become proficient readers and writers. These strategies include, but are not limited to, role-playing and 
components of a Balanced Literacy Program including shared reading and writing, interactive writing, guided and independent 
reading and read alouds. We use graphic organizers and cooperative learning provides ELL students with an opportunity to 
engage in accountable talk. Furthermore, ENL instruction utilizes pictures, games, Total Physical Response (TPR), 
dramatization, text representations, and manipulatives, chants, songs, poems, and charts to help them acquire language skills. 
ELL students are given an opportunity to operate at all levels of the cognitive domain, striving to reach higher order thinking 
skills such as: analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Phonics and vocabulary instruction are provided through various materials to 
help build language acquisition. Class trips provide the ENL teacher with opportunities for discussion, language experience 
approach and reinforcement of topics being taught in the classroom. Numeracy acquisition is developed through engaging in 
hands on activities. ELL students have multiple opportunities to make connections in science and social studies through 
literature. 
  
Data that is being used is formative and summative data that teachers are collecting in the classroom. In addition,teacher 
utilized the NYSESLAT data in order to determine gaps in all modalities.    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

 Improvements for the upcoming school year includes the following: 
 
- We have 62  students who scored EX in the NYSESLAT yet, they scored a 1 in the NYS ELA exam. We plan to utilizing i-ready 
during the after school programs to support students with their language skills to improve their NYS ELA results. 
 
- We also noticed that we have students who have also scored 1 or 2 in the ELA exam. Teacher will utilizing techniques from 
the Hallmark 1 Advance Literacy District Instructional Initiative to support our students by providing them with rich academic 
content and multiple entry points.  
 
- For all ELLS we will focus on Hallmark 4 from Advanced Literacy to build students high utility vocabulary and academic

language. 
 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Due to low enrollment of students, we no longer have the students needed to open up a TB class. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 We offer a variety of programs to our ELLs during the school day aside from the core curriculum. Students generally receive 
one forty five minute period a day of a subject such as physical education, movement, music, art, technology, Spanish, library, 
science lab and writing. Students who have IEPs or require special services may also receive, speech therapy, occupational 
therapy, physical therapy, SETTS or counseling. Our administrative team and service providers work collaboratively to ensure 
that there are no scheduling conflicts and that students have the opportunity to participate in all activities and receive 
mandated services as well. Our school offers a variety of after-school and Saturday programs such as Title III, NYS Math Test 
Prep, NYS ELA Test Prep, NYSESLAT Test Prep, Saturday Academy, SES Tutoring Services through Liberty Learning Lab and 
Edison Learning as part of Title I, as well as chorus and sports after school programs. We ensure that our ELLs get equal access 
to these programs in a number of ways. We make every effort to schedule these programs so that the students do not have to 
choose one over another. We also provide written notices and permission slips to parents for these programs in the native 
languages. Bilingual staff members are available during these programs to assist students who are unable to communicate in 
English. Our bilingual office staff which includes secretaries and school aides are always available to answer questions from 
parents about these programs as well as provide follow-up to parents if needed. We also schedule our book fairs, school trips, 
school dances and movie nights so that they do not fall on or immediately before school exams that our ELLs participate in 
such as the NYSESLAT. 
  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Native Language Materials and Support: Bilingual dictionaries, glossaries, and bilingual and native language  
books are used to support students' native language. In our ENL program, newcomer students are paired with  
bilingual students when necessary. Cognates and cognate word walls are used to scaffold language learning.  
Pictures and realia are used. 
  
Please see question regarding the technology that our school utilize to support our ELLs.    
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

The materials used in our programs are aligned to the core curriculum.  This includes the use of high interest/low level texts 
and primary sources.  Materials include native language sources and instructional technology to support both English and the 
mother tongue of our English language learners.  Recognizing that reading and writing in the native language supports the 
acquisition of English, P.S.127 has acquired bilingual classroom libraries and stories on tape in several languages.  Teachers 
support both reading and writing in the native language and encourage students to incorporate their native language, culture 
and experiences in classroom projects that are personally meaningful to them.   Furthermore, bilingual dictionaries as well as 
culturally relevant books are evident in all our classrooms.  Spanish language and Latino culture are important parts of the 
school-wide curriculum and we take great pride in our yearly Hispanic heritage program. Due to the fact that children’s native 
language is a valuable asset to be fostered, we also provide native language support to our ELLs through our Spanish classes 
and through daily interactions with our large staff of bilingual teachers and paraprofessionals.  Our ELLs are provided with 
opportunities for meaningful interactions in both English and their native language, including verbal interactions and 
engagement with printed materials and books.  Furthermore, all our ELLs are provided with a variety of instructional strategies 
to assist them in the development of academic language and literacy.  Effective practices such as graphic organizers, 
semantic maps, concept maps, modeled writing and read aloud foster academic language development and are utilized in all 
our classrooms.  Classrooms are print rich with word walls, rubrics, student work and charts modeling correct language 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

usage.  Additionally, we maintains a state of the art computer lab with a smart board, and computers are distributed in 
classrooms throughout the school.    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

  ELL services and resources correspond with ELL's ages and grade levels. Grade level materials are utilized in  
the programs. In addition, ELL teachers use grade level pacing calendars and curriculum maps when planning and consult with 
classroom teachers . They also refer to the Common Core State Standards when planning to ensure that their materials is age 
appropriate.   
Teachers customize the resources by using TPR,and visual aides. In addition,teachers chunk material and utilize guided notes 
to support students. We realize that all students learn differently therefore there is a myraid of scaffolding and adoption that is 
executed to support students with mastering the curriculum.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We do not share a building. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
 Selected students are given an opportunity to attend the summer enrichment program for ELLs. 
 
Unfortunately,P.S. 127  does not have any  activities in place before the beginning of the school year to assist newly enrolled  
students; however P.S.127 does have several activities to assist ELL's at the start of the school year and during the  
school year. These include parent orientation breakfasts, open school night, and the pairing of newcomers with  
bilingual students to assist them. In addition, the school provide numerous activities that involves students and  
parents such as: Fall Festival,Breakfast with the Principal,Novemberfest. 
  
All staff members participate in the above activities (Principal,teachers,Parent Coordinator,Bilingual Coordinator etc) 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

  Spanish 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

2017-18 we expanded our Dual Language (Spanish/English) program into the 8th grade. We now offer 
Dual Language classes in grades K-8. 
 
In our Dual Language classes the English proficient students as well as the ELLs spend 50% of their 
instructional time in English and 50% of their instructional time in Spanish by alternating the language of 
instruction every other day.  
  
The languages are separated by time, subject and theme and are not used simultaneously. Teachers 
alternate the language of instruction on a daily basis in all subject areas such as reading, writing, math, 
science and social studies. The Dual language model being used is the self-contained model.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

 

A typical student schedule includes literacy, writing and word study in the language of the day(English or 
Spanish) for a minimum of one hundred and thirty five minutes daily. Mathematics instruction is 
delivered for ninety minutes in the language of the day (English or Spanish) on a daily basis. Social studies 
is provided three times a week for forty five minutes and science is provided three times a week for forty 
five minutes in the language of the day. Students also receive special subjects such as art, music, 
technology, writing and movement which are delivered by cluster teachers for forty-five minutes. These 
activities are strategically programmed into the schedule to ensure enriching learning opportunities for 
the students. 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 PS 127 will offer several staff-development sessions for our ENL/Bilingual teachers as well as our monolingual staff.  
These sessions will take place on staff-development days as well as during the common preparation periods. There will be a 
series of  ongoing workshops which will include the following:  
1.   Introduction and review of the  NYSESLAT  
2.   NYSESLAT data analysis to drive instruction  
3.   Using student data to drive instruction  
4.   Santillana Amigos/ Estreillta Program Training for Bilingual Teachers  
5.   Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System Training  
6. Leading Advanced Literacy Instruction to Promote ELLs' Achievement 
7. I Ready Training for using data to drive instruction 
 
     
     We have also formed a professional development committee which consists of the administrative team, teacher center 
representative and literacy coaches. The team meets regularly and collaborates to provide support to all teachers with an 
emphasis on ELL and special education strategies. The team streamlines and organizes all of the professional development 
activities that take place inside and outside of the school so that they are appropriate for each teachers' needs. The PD 
committee also distributes surveys to staff so that they can determine the areas that teachers  require professional 
development in. We also offer staff development to both monolingual teachers and teachers of ELLs on language transfer 
issues through workshops offered by the Department of Education, OELL, BETAC as well as the City University of New York. A 
system has been put into place to ensure that teachers who attend these workshops have the opportunity to turn-key the 
information to the rest of the staff.  The PD committee works with teachers in using ELL strategies, scaffolding, and language 
structures needed in order to transition students from social language proficiencies to academic language proficiencies. 
Differentiated professional development is offered to pedagogues by literacy coaches in the form of model lessons targeting 
specific teacher needs. Demonstration lessons in the classroom are followed up by a debriefing session, highlighting best 
practices observed in the lesson, teacher feedback, possible follow-up classroom visits, and further coaching opportunities. 
Debriefing sessions are designed to create a foundation for collaborative teaching discussions that allow for pedagogues to 
connect the P.D. sessions offered to daily classroom practices. Open periods are also offered as an opportunity for teachers to 
request any additional resources, assistance, or support that may still be required. In addition to ELL staff development, our 
staff will receive further training through our literacy coaches and teacher mentors. through workshops offered by BETAC, 
OELL, CUNY, PS 127 New Teacher Network, as well as through the New York City Department of Education. Our professional 
development committee along with the administration keep a record of these workshops. A secretary also registers the 
teachers for the workshops and prints a confirmation which is kept in a binder as well. The teachers file the agendas of the ELL 
workshops they have attended in their tenure portfolio binders. They also log in these professional development hours into 
the New York State Office of Teaching Website, so that they will count towards the mandated hours of professional

development required to maintain their license.  The professional development committee also coordinates the workshop 
offerings for the administrative team and support staff to suit their needs. 
 We are currently in the Learning Partners Program working together with two other schools that have similar populations and 
needs. 
 
Guidance Counselors receive professional development around CR Part 154 in the beginning of the school year.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
In our school,we have three guidance counselor who work to support all of our students. We have a guidance counselor for 
the early elementary grades,upper elementary along with the middle school. Once an ELL student has met the requirement 
and will be promoted to middle school or high school,our guidance counselor work with these students in counseling groups to 
support students with the skills needed to be successful as they move on in their lives. In addition,our guidance counselor 
facilitates several workshops for parents and teachers regarding school transitions. 
  
Our school provide,high quality professional development that is of sufficient intensity and duration that have a positive and 
lasting impact on the teachers’ performance in classrooms.We do this buy utilizing Title III funds to send our teachers and 
school building leaders  to city-wide and nation wide professional development. In addition to outside professional 
development,our school offer PD for all ENL/Bilingual teachers on Mondays.During these PD sessions, teachers engage in 
action research,data analysis and traditional professional development sessions.  
The PD committee house all professional development records.     
 
 

Parental Involvement 

 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
During the Parent Teacher Conferences,our teachers along with the ESL/Bilingual Coordinator meets with the parents of ELLs 
to discuss their child's progress towards attaining their goal. At these meetings,we provide translation services for all parents 
who requires this service. If a parent is absent on PTC night,the teacher and the ESL/Bilingual Coordinator schedules an 
appointment with the parent at the most convenient time for that parent.  
 In addition,our school provides qualified interpreter/translator in the language or mode of communication the parent or 
guardian best understands. Our school determines the manner and form of such individual parent meetings, in accordance 
with collective bargaining agreements. We also maintain a record of attendance using existing procedures.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Our parent involvement begins with the parent orientation sessions and continues to extend much further. Many of the 
parents of our ELL students participate as volunteers in our school through the Learning Leaders Program. We also have a full-
time Parent Coordinator. The Parent Coordinator and the ELL Coordinator work collaboratively throughout the year organizing 
and conducting the workshops for parents of newly enrolled ELLs. The Parent Coordinator and ELL Coordinator also work 
collaboratively in scheduling workshops for parents 
 
P.S. 127 also collaborates with several community based organizations such as Vaughn College, LaGuardia Kiwanis and 
LaGuardia Community Outreach. Our Parent Coordinator in collaboration with LaGuardia Community Outreach will hold a job 
fair for parents of the community. Community groups offer their services to help our students socially and academically. 
Elmcor provides recreational as well as educational activities for the students in the community.

PS 127Q’s Title III program will provide ELL parents with family literacy and language acquisition workshops so they can assist 
their children in learning English at home. This year we are offering workshops to provide information to parents to help them 
acquire a greater understanding of the Common Core Standards, promotional criteria and state assessments. The Title III 
parent workshops are given by members of our staff who are bilingual so the native language can be used if needed.  A series 
of three two-hour workshops will be held on different topics to accommodate the schedules of the parents. The topics of the 
workshops will be as follows: The NYSESLAT Exam and its components: How to help your children make gains in listening, 
speaking, reading and writing; The NYS Assessment Calendar and how to help your children do their best. Parent workshops 
will be facilitated by our Bilingual / ESL teachers and Parent Coordinator. The sessions will be held after school on Saturdays 
and in the evenings to accommodate parental needs.  
 
In addition to the above programs we also  have activities such as International family night, Novemberfest,Coffee with the 
Principal, School Leadership Team, and Title I meetings. The activities provides parents with the opportunity to share their 
culture and any specific concerns.    
 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
 P.S. 127 continues to experience a rapid growth in enrollment as well as an increase in our number of English Language Learners. 
The majority of our ELLs have a home language of Spanish and the number of lower-incidence languages is increasing. We have 
seen an increase in the number of Asian languages spoken and our Bengali-speaking population has doubled continuously for the 
past two years. We are also noticing an influx of Arabic speaking students from Yemen, Egypt and Lybia. Our Parent Coordinator, 
ELL Bilingual Coordinator and parent volunteers work together to ensure that we are meeting the needs and interests of these 
students and their parents. We have also developed a student mentoring program in which middle school students support newly 
enrolled ELLs. The demographics of our community is changing and we are making every effort to ensure that our programs reflect 
these changes. We have continued to expand our Spanish dual language program to meet the needs of the community based on 
parental choice. Our dual language programs allow our Spanish-speaking students as well as our English proficient students 
opportunities to become truly bilingual, biliterate and bicultural. Our school community will continue to ensure that the programs 
we offer reflect the needs of the students and community.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Evita Sanabria, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

During registration at PS 127, parents or guardians complete a HLIS (Home Language Identification Survey) which 
is part of the student's cumulative folder. The ELL Coordinator (a licensed pedagogue) interviews the parent 
during this process to make sure that the form is completed properly and accurately.  

The survey requests information about the languages that are spoken in the home and how frequently these 
languages are spoken. It also asks parents to identify the preferred language they wish to receive verbal and 
written communication from the school. 
  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71 

 

When necessary we utilize the over the phone translation provided by the office of Translation and Interpretation 
Unit - if we do not have a qualified person in our building to translate to the parent.  

This information is then entered into ATS by the pupil accounting secretary. A RAPL report is run on ATS by class . 

Our Administrative team and our Language Access Coordinator often receive requests from staff members 
regarding translation needs. 

They then identify a staff member or community member that speaks the target language. The school uses this 
information to make every effort in providing notices and information in other languages so that parents are 
informed of school events and policies. As we receive information of parent updated language preference we run 
another report to ensure that we have the most updated report (RAPL).  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In an event of a school emergency we have a telephone system that we use to communicate with parents in their 
preferred language.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

During Staff meetings Chancellor's Regulation A-663 will be distributed.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Our Parent Coordinator has copies of the Parent Rights and responsibilities brochure which she gives to parents upon 
registration for the parents and general meetings. These brochures are also available in her office. Upon entering the 
school, Parental Notification Postings are visible to all visitors assuring them the availability of translators. Important 
documents are also available from the DOE. Depending on the needs of the parents, letters are translated into a 
variety of home languages and interpreters are hired when necessary. 

Parents may also indicate that they need interpreters through written communication with the school. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77 

 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Throughout the year, we will review and update ATS reports which indicate parents preferred language. 

Additionally, we analyze data from our latest parent survey and 96% of our parents strongly agree/agree that our 
school  

communicates with them in a language that they can understand.
