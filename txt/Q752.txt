Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Pursuant to the school’s mission statement, “The Queens Transition Center supports all students in gaining access to, 
and being successful in their post-secondary lives. It is our mission to ensure that students graduate from this public 
educational experience with skills, intrinsic abilities and sufficiently developed work ethics. Our commitment to caring 
helps achieve our goal to provide access for all students ensuring them a quality education, through transition and 
technology. This allows students to respond to societal expectations which will enable them to succeed as functional, 
independent, contributing members of their communities.”

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
The Queens Transition Center is a District 75 high school with 366 students from grade 9 through grade 12. The school 
population comprises 55% Black, 28% Hispanic, 7% White, 9% Asian and 1% American Indian/Alaskan Native students. 
The student body includes 20% English language learners and 100% special education students. Boys account for 69% 
of the students enrolled and girls account for 31%. The student population includes student in Standardized and 
Alternately assessed classes. One hundred percent of the students possess and Individual Education Program (IEP). 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The student population includes students who access Alternate Assessment and Standardized Assessment 
coursework. One hundred percent of students possess an Individual Education Program (IEP) and they are classified in 
the following ratios 6:1:1, 8:1:1, 9:1:3 and 12:1:1. Their needs include provisions for access to speech, occupational 
and physical therapy. Although the population of students at the Queens Transition Center consists of students with 
multiple disabilities, the school’s focus relies on strengthening the varying “abilities” of our students and providing 
them with opportunities and experiences which mirror those found in a comprehensive, general education high 
school.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which our school has made the most progress over the past year 
are: Rigorous Instruction, Collaborative teachers, Effective School Leadership and supportive environment. The 
Queens’ Transition Center’s key areas of focus for the 2018-2019 are Trust and Strong-Family Community ties.  

In the area of rigorous instruction there was evidence of the following: 

● An increase in the percentage of students sitting and passing the Regents exams in comparison to data analyze 
during the 2016-2017 school year and the 2017-2018 school year.  

● An increase in the number of students making inquiries in college and employment opportunities, thus adding the 
trips to visit Yale, Princeton and City University of New York (CUNY). 

● An increase in the participation of students in academic activities such as: The Stock Market game and the District 
75 Debate team. 

● An increase in the utilization of Technology in every classroom.  

In the area of Collaborative teachers there was evidence of the following 

● An increase in the positive interactions and collaborations between our Inclusion teachers and their General 
Education Colleagues.  

In the area of Supportive Environment & Trust there was evidence of the following 

● An increase in sports opportunities such as: basketball (CHAMPS/PSAL), flag football , and running (NY. Road 
Runners/ Mighty Milers) . 

● An increase of participants engaging in the STEP ahead after school program for career readiness (winners of 
entrepreneurship competition summer 2014). 

● An increase in the number of community-based organization partnerships to support social emotional growth such 
as STEP USA, and Shades of Beauty. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

● An increase in the student participation in the ARTS .Specifically visual arts and music and introduction of music for 
our students with Autism such as: Music That Heals program and the addition of a licensed music/special educator to 
staff.  

● The addition of the Getting Ready to Learn (GRTL) yoga program physical fitness for setting that build attention, 
awareness, physical relaxation, and sensory balance for our students on the Autism spectrum disorder and the 
expansion of the program to the Elmhurst Educational Campus .

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Throughout the Queens Transition Center (QTC), there is a shared school- wide belief that links rigor with the use of 
Webb’s Depth of Knowledge (DOK) categories. During the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 school years, members of the 
QTC Instructional Cabinet (IC) and staff members from the QTC community, continue to reinforce defining “rigor” for 
all populations of the student body. Teachers continue to utilize the DOK categories to assist students to actively 
engage in intellectual activities that are challenging, differentiated, and age appropriate. In addition, data from the 
ADVANCE teacher evaluation system was aggregated and resulted in the QTC Instructional Cabinet to embed 
additional strategies to address “discussion & questioning techniques” and “designing coherent Instruction” to ensure 
that high standards are set in every classroom and lessons are Common Core aligned. During the 2015-2016 school 
year, staff members looked at best practices of the school, trends and systems and attempted to align school 
information with the DOS' Capacity framework. This enabled staff members to dicuss potential goals for the 2017-
2018 school year. The goals for the 2018-2019 school year will continue to focus on building the capacity of all 
stakeholders and allowed staff members to utilize the data from the Quality Review of 2017-2018 to impact student 
outcomes. 

Lastly, the QTC community continues to strive to focus on activities aligned to the Department of Education’s “Shared 
Path to Success”, the “multi-phase initiative, focusing on preparing all students to graduate from high school fully 
prepared for college, careers, and independent living”. This includes counselors and school staff engaging in systems 
of on-going transcript review, on-going review of Regents requirements and ongoing review of Career Development 
Occupational Standards (CDOS). 

Based on the feedback from the 2017-2018 Quality Review, the priority areas needs that will continue to be 
addressed includes:  

● Assuring that teachers are producing and utilizing higher- order work products across grades and subject areas.  

● Ensuring the availability of sufficient evidence of tiered supports to monitor progress for struggling learners and 

● Increasing the monitoring of instructional planning to increase continuity across all classrooms and disciplines. 

Increasing the utilization of higher work products across all classrooms.

priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, there will be a 50% increase in the instructional staff’s utilization of higher-order work products to 
increase student outcomes by 10%, as evidenced by summative data from Student Assessment Need Determination 
Inventory (SANDI) , Formative Assessment of Standard Tasks (FAST), Regents and the Advance teacher evaluation 
system.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The Queens Transition Center’s school community continues to articulate a vision that professional collaboration 
successfully impacts student outcomes. The school’s mantra, given the multi-sited, multi- faceted nature of the 
organization continues to be “One School, One Voice” which is intended to promote togetherness, unity, and 
collaboration. 

Each year school leaders evaluate current structures and activities and make the necessary adjustments to increase 
the impact of the work within the school community. The QTC community aligns their teacher team activities aligned 
to The Department of Education’s “Citywide Instructional Expectations” specifically “collaborative professional 
learning”. This initiative allowed our school to create activities which refines, continues to develop and deepens the 
work our school engages in regarding to collaborative professional learning. The Queens Transition Center’s Teacher 
teams are structured to address the rationale to systematically analyze key elements of classroom practice and build 
instructional coherence throughout the school community. Teachers engage with the Danielson’s Framework for 
Teaching, the DOE’s College and Career Readiness Benchmarks, the Four Pillars of Student Achievement and The 
Framework for Great Schools. By utilizing strategic work protocols, assessment data, student work samples and 
collaborative inquiry, teachers are able to make informed instructional decisions, impact student achievement and 
engage in the process of shared-decision making to increase student outcomes.  

Based on the school’s needs assessment the priority needs that will be addressed includes: 

Assuring that new teachers and those rated ineffective or developing are paired with those teachers engaging in 
structured, collaborative inquiry  

Increase the structured collaborations to include social/emotional goal creation to support academic success. 

Lastly, The Queens Transition Center’s SLT will utilize summative information from student assessments, OORS data 
and parental engagement activities from the 2017-2018 school year, to look at gaps between the current state of the 
school and the school’s mission for the future. The SLT will then create a flow chart or priority list to set short and long 
term goals for the current school year and discuss actions steps and selecting new programs and innovations to close 
the gap. The SLT will also revisit the school’s mission and vision statement to describe the school’s current state and 
revisit how to message to schools vision and mission to the community at large. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Queens Transition Center, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A 
of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Queens Transition Center will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSA/State accountability 
system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning 
Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in

sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

 Q752 also known as the Queens Transition Center (QTC) is a high school with 420 students in 
grades 9 to 12, 112 of whom are ELLs. Students are aged 14-21 years. We serve students in 
staffing ratios of 6:1:1, 8:1:1, 12:1:1. Students participate in standardized and alternate 
assessments. Presently 50% of our school population participates in standardized assessment, 
and 50% in alternate assessment. The student body includes 27% English Language Learners and 
100% special education students. The school population comprises 61% Black or African 
American, 24% Hispanic or Latino, 9% Asian or Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islands, 5% 
White and 1% American Indian or Alaska Native students. 
QTC offers a rigorous curriculum, providing students with diverse special needs in grades 9-12 
with classroom, shop, and community-based learning experiences. QTC serves 74 English 
Language Learners (ELLs), which is 19% of our total school population.  Seventy-
four ELLs participated in 2016-2017 NYSESLAT to determine their language proficiency 
level. All 15 students entitled to Bilingual Instructional Services as per their IEP receive ENL 
services supported by alternate language paraprofessionals in their native language.  
QTC endeavors to provide our ELLs with the units of ENL services pursuant to CR Part 154 
mandates as much as it is possible within the confines of staffing and student placement. The 
ENL services are provided by two New York State certified ENL teachers, Ms. Anna 
Ghasabyan, holding a professional certificate, and Konstantyn Cybura, holding Initial certificate, 
through Stand Alone and Integrated ENL models of instruction. 
To ensure that students meet the standards and pass the required state and local assessments, 
ENL instruction follows the NYS Common Core Learning Standards, New Language Arts 
Progressions and incorporates alternate grade level indicators from NYSAA for Social Studies 
and Science, and NYSAA Extensions in ELA and Math, Career Development and Occupational 
Studies and utilizes ESL strategies and methodologies. The ENL instruction is designed on the 
principles of the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) creating such instructional goals, 
methods, materials, and assessments that are effectively used to support all students and can be 
modified and adjusted for individual needs of our diverse school population. In addition, the 
Cognitive Language Learning Approach (CALLA) and Quality Teaching for English Learners 
(QTEL) strategies and scaffolding are integrated into the instruction.  
Every spring, all ELLs are administered New York State English as a Second Language 
Achievement Test (NYSESLAT) to assess their English proficiency. NYSESLAT is a state-
mandated test to measure the proficiency and growth in English language acquisition of the 
ELLs.  The 2017 NYSESLAT featured greater emphasis on academic and classroom contexts 
and new items that address the Common Core shift to reading for information.  Based on 
NYSESLAT 2018 test results, 66 students scored at Entering level, 21 students scored at

Emerging level, 13 at Transitioning, and 12 at Expanding level. Twenty-fife (25) students 
showed significant progress in mastering cognitive academic language skills in English and 
scored one proficiency level higher or moved up on the Proficiency Level Continuum in 
2018 NYSESLAT as compared to 2017 NYSESLAT results. Students who participated in 2017-
2018 Title III after school program also showed big progress in English language learning: 2 
students scored from Transitioning to Expanding level. 
P752Q is a specialized high school in District 75 serving  100% students with IEPs. Our students 
require specific testing accommodations. The implementation of the accommodations requires a 
recommendation from the LAP team and signature of the team’s chair, a parent/guardian and the 
principal. Questions regarding the proposed accommodations are directed to the school’s Test 
Coordinator. The implementation of the Language Allocation Policy will be an ongoing process 
that will involve the school administration, ENL and content area teachers, paraprofessionals, 
related service providers and parents. Alternate Placement Paraprofessionals support students in 
use of the Native Language to foster comprehension in the target language. 
The ENL and other teachers involved in providing classroom instruction to our ELL population 
will constantly assess their progress by collecting evidence of student learning and need of mid-
course changes that are systematically implemented across the program. 
Title III supplemental instructional support will be provided to 12 ELL students in grades 10-12 
in classes with 12:1:1 ratio. Services will be provided by Ms. Anna Ghasabyan, a certified ENL 
teacher. Professional development workshops and parent workshops will also be provided by 
ENL teacher Ms. Anna Ghasabyan. Language of instruction is English. Students, whose IEPs 
indicate Bilingual Instructional Services will receive home language support from the alternate 
placement paraprofessionals who speak their native languages. Parents speaking other languages 
will be supported by alternate language paraprofessional according to their language needs. 
Students will receive services twice a week, every Tuesday and Friday, for 28 days (language 
instruction period),  at the (Elmhurst Educational Campus (EEC) off-site of the QTC  from 3:00 
– 5:00 p.m. Our entire Title III program "Robots in Our Lives" will start in February 2019 and 
end in May 2019.  
All our students have different developmental disabilities such as intellectual disability, autism, 
attention deficit, emotional disturbance, etc. All 12 students who will participate in Title III after 
school program are in Alternate Assessment program at QTC and participate in classes focusing 
on functional academic skills, communication, and daily living skills. Some of these students 
will also participate in Community-Based Learning program where they gain experience they 
need to enter the world of work upon completing high school. 
Based on the data collected from student assessments, portfolios,  and student interests, our 
school decided to reinforce literacy instruction through STEM program utilizing innovative 
technology tools such as smart phones, iPads, laptops, gizmos and gadget kits.  
STEM is a popular acronym that stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. 
Journal of Special Education Technologies highlights the need of highly trained individuals to 
compete in the STEM workforce. According to the National Science Foundation, individuals 
with disabilities are employed in only 5–6% of the U.S. STEM jobs. Educators are encouraged to 
provide accessible and relevant instruction in STEM at the secondary and post-secondary levels 
including helping students with disabilities participate and progress in STEM curricula. Whether 
it is to support students with learning, sensory, or physical disabilities in pursuing careers in 
STEM or to incorporate elements of STEM curricula for students with intellectual or behavioral 
challenges, innovative technology tools offer students with disabilities opportunities to be 
successful. (Students with Disabilities Can Participate and Succeed in STEM Education, 
Technology and Media Division of the Council for Exceptional Children, www.tamcec.org). 
Recent studies published in the Journal of Autism and Development Disorders indicate students 
with autism naturally gravitate toward majors in STEM-related fields at even higher rates than

Our English Language Learners come from different backgrounds and have different learning 
styles, academic and social-emotional and behavioral needs. Therefore, the universal design of 
instruction is the key for success for all students. Our after school program is specifically 
designed to make the lectures, discussions, visual aids, videos, tech tools, printed materials, web 
resources and hands-on work accessible to all our students. 
QTC will purchase Littlebits Electronics STEM Learning kits, new generation iPads to introduce 
our students to the modern-day innovative tools to create exceptional work of their own and 
develop skills, knowledge and confidence to be prepared for and excel in the contemporary 
competitive world. 
Our school will use the motivational effects of robotics to teach students Computer Science, 
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (CS-STEM). Students will engage in 
problem solving, creative thinking and collaboration through invention-based learning and 
developing content core vocabulary and mastering their reading skills. These programs are 
designed in partnership with educators to incorporate NGSSs and Common Core in curriculum. 
Students will learn how to design robots and use iPads to code the robots to perform different 
tasks. Students will download and use Littlebits Invent App to complete these activities. ENL 
instruction will be designed on the principles of the Universal Design for Learning and 
incorporating educational resources from Reading Rockets, http://www.readingrockets.org/, You

The Title III professional development plan at QTC will offer opportunities for our staff 
members (1 Assistant Principal/Administrator, 1 teacher, 1 paraprofessional) to receive adequate 
training to provide our ELL population with sufficient support to alleviate their social and 
academic challenges and meet the goals and objectives set by this program.  
The professional development series will enhance the ability of teachers and paraprofessionals 
participating in the series to understand the challenges ELLs face in school, acquire effective 
strategies to build and implement rigorous lessons aligned with the Common Core Learning 
Standards, assess and remediate possible challenging behavior of ELLs and ensure they receive 
necessary social, emotional, and academic supports to perform at high levels. 
There will be six (6) Title III professional development workshops that will take place on 
alternate Thursdays throughout the program from 3:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m. commencing one week 
prior to the instructional program. The students will not be in attendance during the professional 
development workshops. The professional development workshops will be provided by the

Begin description here:            
Our school will invite parents of English Language Learners on Tuesdays and Fridays from 3:00-
5:00 pm to our Title III after school program to learn and work alongside with their children. 
Parents will have a unique opportunity to collaborate with the students, develop computer and 
smart tech skills and share their experiences. ELL parents will also learn effective ways of 
supporting their children’s education and improving their language proficiency level, learn about 
the new Common Core Standards and expectations, STEM content areas and  develop new smart 
technological skills to enhance their English language proficiency level and content area 
knowledge. 
Parents will work and learn alongside with their children how innovative tools such as iPads, 
smart phones, tablets, Smart Board enhance their children's academic success, personalize their 
learning and provide them with the skills and proficiencies necessary for their daily living and 
workforce in the future.  
During the period of our Title III program parents will also participate in discussions on such 
topics as Title III overview and implementation, building collaboration between schools and 
parents of English Language Learners, Common Core Standards, STEM programs for ELLs, 
iPad Basics, exploring literacy, organizational, educational Apps, etc. 
Prior to starting our Title III program, the DOE Title III letters will be sent out to parents 
informing them about our Title III program and available services in a parent's preferred 
language as stated in a student's IEP. The interpretation / translation services will be in place to 
provide the parents of ELLs with all necessary information in their preferred language. All the 
necessary information, letters, handbooks, IEPs and other documents will be translated either 
orally (by phone or in person) or in written from the New York City Department of Education 
web site or with the help of our translators unit. The majority of parents expected to attend our 
program are Spanish-speakers.  A Spanish-speaking alternate placement paraprofessional will 
work with the parents to meet their language needs. 
Parents will also receive educational resources for their future reference and practice at home as 
well as certificates of completion of the program.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
In compliance with NCLB, I.D.E.A., and Part 200, students with severe disabilities are administered the New York State 
Alternate Assessment (NYSAA), SANDI-FAST. The NYSAA is used to assess student progress in meeting New York State ELA, 
Math, Science, and Social Studies learning standards. Students also take SORT, Key Math and Edperformance. These tests 
provide the teachers with data, which can be tailored to classroom instruction and also individual and evolving needs of 
students.  
Edperformance is a computer-adaptive standards-based test that lets teachers quickly pinpoint the proficiency level of 
students, across a range of subjects (English Language Arts, Reading, and Mathematics). This provides for more accurate 
student placement; diagnosis of instructional needs, including instructional adjustments; and measurement of student gains 
across reporting periods.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

 

The following assessment tools are also used to determine the level of language proficiency for ELLs: 
•     NYSITELL 
•     NYSESLAT 
•     NYSAA 
.    SANDI 
•     Progress Reports 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Teachers receive coaching and support from our School-Based Coach and Testing Coordinator. Teachers work individually and 
in collaborative teams to test students and use data to plan their instruction. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The ENL and content area teachers who deliver instruction to our  ELLs continuously assess students' progress by collecting 
evidence of student learning and need for mid-course changes that are systematically implemented across the program. 
Our ELLs participate in the NYSESLAT yearly testing. The NYSESLAT test results come back in July and provide students, 
teachers, and parents with an objective report of each student’s strengths and weaknesses in the English language skills of 
listening, speaking, reading and writing. Our school uses ATS RLAT report to receive the last three years’ NYSESLAT scale scores 
as well as each student’s modality results for reading/writing and speaking/listening. 
Our ELLs also participate in SANDI-FAST online Alternate Assessment for students with disabilities aligned with ELA, Math, 
Social Studies, Science NYS CCLSs, Emotional, Behavioral, Transition-Education, Employment, Transition-Community. SANDI-
FAST also assesses student's fine motor, gross motor skills, and adaptive daily living skills as baseline/benchmark 
assessment. We use this information to determine whether these students are making adequate progress toward English 
language proficiency and make appropriate adjustments in our instruction so that all ELL students become proficient in 
English. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Summative data is used to design a differentiated individualized instruction for every ELL to ensure they actively and 
adequately participate in all academic classes. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
P752Q is a high school. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Every spring all our ELLs participate in New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test. Several ATS reports are 
utilized to determine students eligible for NYSESLAT and to analyze data (RLER-LAT, RLAT, HISE). 
In 2017-2018 school year,  9 students were administered NYSITELL, and all nine students scored at the Entering Level. Based 
on NYSESLAT 2018 test results, 66 students scored at the Entering level, 21 students scored at the Emerging level,  13 at the 
Transitioning and 12 at the Expanding level. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Our ENL teacher closely collaborates with content are classroom teachers as well as share data and their professional opinion 
during teacher team meetings. Collaboratively, they design differentiated lessons that support every student's academic and 
language needs.

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

P752Q offers freestanding English as a new language (ENL) programs providing instruction in English with home 
language support, emphasizing English language acquisition. As per CR Part 154, there are 2 types of ENL: Stand-alone 
ENL -  instruction to develop English language skills so that students can succeed in core content courses. It is 
delivered by a certified ENL teacher, and, Integrated ENL: instruction to build English language skills through content 
area instruction. It is delivered by co-teaching by a certified ENL teacher and a certified content area teacher (i.e., 
English language arts, math, science, or social studies). This method of integrated ENL instruction includes content 
area subject matter and English language development using ENL strategies.   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

P752Q features ENL program only. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

P752Q features ENL program only. 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Our ELLs are serviced by two New York State certified ENL teachers through freestanding stand-alone ENL and integrated ENL 
programs. The language of instruction is English with native language support. Other staff servicing the ELLs include bilingual 
paraprofessionals (Spanish, Bengali, Chinese, Haitian Creole, Hindi and Urdu), and one bilingual guidance counselor (Spanish). 
Due to the nature of the population of students whom we serve and diversity of their individual needs and IEP mandated 
service requirements as well as native language backgrounds, it is not always possible to form a bilingual class. In this case a 
student whose IEP recommendation is Bilingual Services, he/she is provided with ENL services, plus an Alternate Placement 
Paraprofessional, who speaks the student’s native language and English. As per CR Part 154 mandates our school provides ENL 
program based on a student’s English language proficiency level, as identified by the NYSESLAT, as follows: 
(i) Entering: Students receive at least three units of study or its equivalent of English as a New Language instruction. At least 
one unit of study or its equivalent is Stand-alone English as a New Language instruction; at least one unit of study or its 
equivalent is Integrated English as a New Language in core content; and one unit of study or its equivalent shall be either 
Integrated English as a New Language or Stand-alone English as a New Language instruction.  
(ii) Emerging: Students receive at least two units of study or its equivalent of English as a New Language instruction. At least 
one half of a unit of study or its equivalent shall be in Stand-alone English as a New Language, at least one unit of study or its 
equivalent shall be Integrated English as a New Language in core content instruction, and one half of a unit of study or its 
equivalent shall be either Integrated English as a New Language or Stand-alone English as New Language instruction.  
(iii) Transitioning: Students receive at least one unit of study or its equivalent of English as a New Language Instruction. At least 
one half of a unit of study or its equivalent is in Integrated English as a New Language instruction and at least one half of a unit 
of study or its equivalent is either Integrated English as a New Language instruction or Stand-alone English as a New Language 
instruction. 
(iv) Expanding: Students receive at least one unit of study or its equivalent of Integrated English as New Language instruction. 
(v) Commanding: For at least two school years following the school year in which a student is exited from English Language 
Learner status    
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

At P752Q, the ENL instruction uses the core content curriculum as the base for English as a New Language. The instruction is 
aligned with the New Language Arts Progressions (NLAP) and Home Language Arts Progressions (HLAP) aligned with the NYS 
Common Core Learning Standards. P752Q also provides ENL services during summer school program, and implements Title III 
supplemental program.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Students whose IEPs mandate for bilingual instruction receive ENL services with home language support provided by alternate 
placement language paraprofessionals. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Newcomers receive tutoring, a buddy student, and a nurturing environment to facilitate language production.  This school year 
we will also have Title III after school instructional program where our ELLs receive differentiated instruction utilizing iPad 
applications addressing the different needs of our students and their learning styles. Currently we have 34 newcomers. For 
newcomers we implement an intensive learning program within two weeks to help them obtain minimum basic 
communication skills so they can enter the alternate placement classrooms with some English language knowledge. The 
following intervention strategies will be implemented: 
● Academic Intervention Services (AIS) will be provided to the ELLs to target instruction in listening, speaking, reading and 
writing. 
● ELLs will be provided with related services as indicated in their IEP.    
● ELLs will be paired with other students that can help them with specific reading and writing. 
SIFE: Presently there are 10 students with interrupted formal education (SIFE) at 752Q. In order to recognize and address the 
presence of SIFE, we carefully review the transcripts and/or student records when available, organize structured interviews 
with students and family members to determine whether the student is an immigrant (born in a country other than the USA or 
its territories), and come from a home where a language other than English is spoken, and enters a US school after grade two 
having two years less schooling than their peers, functioning at least two years below expected grade level in reading and in 
mathematics, and being preliterate in their first language. To accommodate the needs of SIFE our school will use the following 
strategies: 
•     Cooperative learning groups where students of all levels can contribute  
•     Modeling learning strategies that facilitate language and content instruction  
•     Multiple teaching and assessment methods that support individualized education  
•     Native language support  
•     Staff support and development  
  
Long-term ELLs continue to receive services that are provided through freestanding snandalon and integrated ENL programs as 
well as sheltered English language programs where they receive services from monolingual teachers who have been trained in 
ENL methodologies and strategies until they reach the language proficiency level to be moved into a monolingual classroom 
setting without ENL services. To ensure that ELLs with disabilities meet the standards and pass the required state and local 
assessments, the ENL instruction follows the NYS NLA standards and alternate grade level indicators (AGLIs) from the NYS ELA 
and Career Development and Occupational Studies and utilizes ENL strategies such as the Cognitive Academic Language 
Learning Approach (CALLA), Total Physical Response (TPR), Language Experience, Whole Language. Appropriate graphic 
organizers and various strategies of differentiated instruction and scaffolding are being utilized during the cooperative learning 
activities that have been adapted for use with ELLs who have severe disabilities (learning disability, emotional disturbance, 
mental retardation, and autism). Multisensory and multicultural ENL materials are infused to all aspects of instruction. 
Students who are in ESL program for more than three years will also participate in our school’s Title III supplemental program. 
Long term ELL students continue to receive services from the ESL teacher as per their IEP. They are also supported through 
Title III after-school program, AIS, Instructional Technology, visual arts enrichment. Students no longer requiring Bilingual or 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

ENL services according to the IEP will be supported for two years with ENL services.  
For the students who have proficiency in the NYSESLAT, a two-year transition plan with related services will be implemented. 
Our ELL students in both standardized and alternate assessments will participate in the after school program funded by the 
Title III. Students will practice and increase their reading and writing skills and enrich their core content knowledge by utilizing 
iPads and other tech tools. The program supports the curriculum and, therefore, the standards. In response to the State 
citation, 752Q provides ENL services to all ELL students as per their IEPs. 
  
All our ELLS are afforded equal opportunities to all schools programs. Students participate in Talent Show, Fashion Show, 
Multicultural projects, Champs after school program, etc. This school year we will also have Title III supplemental after school 
program engaging students in STEM activities, which will enable students achieve their reading and writing goals within 
literacy, learn about healthy eating habits and exercise, and develop student efficacy.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
To accommodate the needs of our ELLs we use the following strategies: 
•     Cooperative learning groups where students of all levels can contribute  
•     Modeling learning strategies that facilitate language and content instruction  
•     Multiple teaching and assessment methods that support individualized education  
.            Integration of technology and instruction 
             Project-based learning 
             Native language support  
•     Staff support and development  
  
These students will also participate in and benefit from our school’s Title III after school instructional program learning English 
with iPads. The iPads will be used to support both reading and writing goals within literacy. They provide multiple ways to 
differentiate content and accommodate a variety of learning needs and styles of our diverse population. Our eligible ELLs will 
continue to receive ENL services as per their IEP, and in accordance with their proficiency levels indicated on the NYSESLAT. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The instruction of ELLs follows the principals of the Universal Design for Learning allowing teacher to differentiate the content 
in multiple ways and accommodate a variety of learning needs and styles of our diverse population. Our eligible ELLs will 
continue to receive ENL services as per their IEP, and in accordance with their proficiency levels indicated on the NYSESLAT. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Our ENL teacher in consultation with content area teachers will collaborate in content area instruction. The content area 
instruction is aligned with the NYS Common Core Standards for ELA, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies and Technology and 
is provided in English. Students in Alternate Placement receive additional support in their native languages from 
paraprofessionals who speak students’ home languages.  All subjects are taught in English through ENL methodologies by 
Special Education teachers who have completed the mandated 10 hours of ENL training organized by the Office of English 
Language Learners, District 75. The Jose P. certificates are kept in teachers' files. The ENL methodologies used include: 
Cognitive Academic Language Learning Approach (CALLA), TPR, Language Experience, the Natural Approach, and multisensory 
approaches are used in conjunction with augmentative communication devices and Mayer Johnson symbols (for autistic 
students). Our school also implements district-wide curriculum Attainment available for ELA, Social Studies and Math.  
Content area instruction will be taught through the use of visuals and/or real objects to support students’ understanding of the 
main academic content. The use of digital resources will also be incorporated into content area instruction to increase ELLs 
English language proficiency. All services and resources are age- and grade-appropriate. 
In Social Studies content area, students will have access to computers and technology to create Powerpoint presentations 
for  exit projects. They will be able to visit teacher-selected websites having opportunity to work with  primary source 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

documents, participate in political on-line debates and elections. Using Smart Board tools, ELLs will create electronic 
notebooks demonstrating their ability to share written information.  Particular focus will be given to preparing students for 
competitive, supported, and sheltered employment. This will be addressed through the NYS Career Development and 
Occupational Studies (CDOS) learning standards. The development of job, functional and literacy skills will be infused 
throughout all aspects of instruction.  
Science: Homework Help and Test Prep – one to one and small group instruction delivered 5 x weekly during regular school 
days on teacher administrative prep. time.                Virtual computer lab - based science laboratory (froguts.com) 
In Math content area, students participate in Equals Mathematics math intervention program. Equals Mathematics is a K-!2 
standards-based curriculum developed for students of different abilities. In Science, students get help with homework and test 
preparation as well as develop and increase their Science knowledge working in the Virtual Lab, a computer-based science 
laboratory (froguts.com). 
 For the students who have proficiency in the NYSESLAT, a two-year transition plan with related services will be implemented. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Currently we have two new programs: Attainment and Equals Mathematics. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

No programs will be discontinued. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All our ELLs have equal opportunity to participate in Title III after school program. Many of our ELLs participate in programs 
focusing on functional academic skills, communication, and daily living skills. Some of these students participate in work-study 
programs where they gain experience they need to enter the world of work upon completing high school. 
The focus of our 2018-2019 Title III supplemental program "Robots in Our Lives" is to introduce our students to modern-day 
innovative tools to create  exceptional work of their own and develop skills, knowledge and confidence to be prepared for and 
excel in the contemporary world. Our school will use motivational effects of robotics to teach students Science, Technology, 
Engineering, and Mathematics ( STEM). Students will engage in  problem solving, creative thinking, ad collaboration through 
invention-based learning and developing content core vocabulary and mastering their reading skills. These programs are 
designed in partnership with educators to incorporate NGSSs and Common Core in curriculum. The individual use of iPads is 
another way to empower students to maximize their full potential and prepare them for college and the workplace. 
Technology immersion into education empowers students to take a more active role in their education and become 
independent learners.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Our school uses iPads, laptops, Smart Board lessons to actively engage all students in learning. 
Use of technology in English language instruction provides fantastic visual and auditory learning opportunities for our student 
population, but only iPad addresses three important learning modalities that students work through: visual, auditory, and 
kinesthetic. Students enter a world of virtual kinesthetics in which they can manipulate information by touch and control 
spatial design. iPad is an incredible literacy tool for the special education classroom. iPads are very adaptive, and can be 
customized to each student's needs, are lightweight and mobile, and give the students the sense they are connected to a 
larger, high-tech community. It's highly engaging and motivating especially for students with learning disabilities, attention 
deficit and emotional disturbance. 
2018-2019, our ELLs will participate in  Title III supplemental program "Robots in Our Lives" that will introduce our students to 
modern-day innovative tools to create  exceptional work of their own and develop skills, knowledge and confidence to be 
prepared for and excel in the contemporary world. Our school will use motivational effects of robotics to 
teach students Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics ( STEM). Students will engage in  problem solving, creative 
thinking, ad collaboration through invention-based learning and developing content core vocabulary and mastering their 
reading skills. These programs are designed in partnership with educators to incorporate NGSSs and Common Core in 
curriculum.

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Students in Alternate Placement receive additional support in their native languages from paraprofessionals who speak the 
students’ home languages.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

P752Q ensures that all students participate in rigorous, age-appropriate and grade-level academic activities as explained in 
prior sections. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our ENL teachers travel to our school's sites to provide ENL services. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
For newcomers we implement an intensive learning program within two weeks to help them obtain minimum basic 
communication skills so they can enter the alternate placement classrooms with some English language knowledge. The 
following intervention strategies will be implemented: 
● Academic Intervention Services (AIS) will be provided to the ELLs to target instruction in listening, speaking, reading and 
writing. 
● ELLs will be provided with related services as indicated in their IEP.    
● ELLs will be paired with other students that can help them with specific reading and writing.

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Currently our school features only ENL.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Fritzy Sannon Brown, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

To ensure that English Language Learners (ELL) parents are provided with meaningful opportunities to have access 
and participate in programs and services critical to their children's education, our school’s LAP team creates a 
database including student names, their parent/guardian information, copies of home language surveys with an 
indication of whether the parents need an interpreter’s support and in what language. Currently, our school's ELL 
parents represent ten language groups (Spanish, Haitian, French, Punjabi, Bengali, Urdu, Polish, Chinese, Korean 
and Turkish). All school-related news and information, letters, handbooks, IEPs and other documents will be 
translated and/or interpreted (by phone or in person) or written in parent's preferred language of communication 
using the New York City Department of Education official website or with the help of the Translation and 
Interpretation unit. 

The language needs of ELL parents at 752Q are identified using a variety of methods and in a variety of ways 
during interactions and interviews with parents. We also consult ATS reports and SESIS information for 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

identification of home languages other-than-English spoken by 752Q ELL parents. In addition, information on 
parent language needs is collected from parents/guardians from the sources and methods listed below.  

• Home languages of students in school indicated in ATS. 

• Evaluations completed by parents during parent meetings, parent conferences, and other parent activities.  

• Language needs identified by parents during IEP conferences. 

• Language needs identified by parents on pre-registration, registration, and attendance forms. 

• Language needs identified by parents to Parent Coordinator during individual and group meetings. 

• Language needs as determined by language of written communication to teachers and other staff received from 
parents. 

• Review of translated written correspondences sent home to parents in the past. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.
