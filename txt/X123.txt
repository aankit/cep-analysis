Section 2: Executive Summary and Organizing Principles 

 
The Objective 
The intent of this Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) is to continue to frame a three-year process 
for each Renewal school and design a comprehensive plan that outlines a strategic path to a paradigm shift in each 
school at every level. The motivation driving this work is our commitment to providing every child with a school that 
meets their academic and social-emotional needs. Closely accompanying this imperative is our belief that every school 
can be renewed and foster a community based culture of learning. The job of the district is to use our position to 
provide the systemic vision, strategies, and resources to facilitate school renewal through a collaborative effort including 
all stakeholders.  
 
The core values held as essential for the success of the School Renewal Program: 

  A “learning stance” must be held by all community members (district leaders, school leaders, school staff, 

community-based partners, students and families). The work should be approached with humility and integrity. 
We must all be willing learners. 

  A “theory of action” must guide the work to ensure clarity and coherence. 
  Authentic teams that collaborate in the spirit of trust, within and across the various levels of the school 

community, are prerequisites for successful school renewal 

  Schools will be places of robust engagement, anchored in positive youth development, ensuring that the school 

environment is welcoming and empowering for students, families and community members. 

  Strong professional development/learning is a fundamental part of our work. 
  The school renewal implementation must be simultaneously dynamic and responsive as well as sustained over 

the three year period of renewal. 

 
The organizing Theory of Action that guides the School Renewal Program strategy: 

By using the Six Elements of the Framework for Great schools as our improvement structure, we seek to align 
instructional coaching and leadership development with structural supports in order to build staff capacity.  
Using schools  instructional foci, school leaders  and staff will implement changes  in curriculum,  instruction, 
school  culture  and  structures  so  that  there  are  sustainable  improvements  in  student  outcomes  and  school 
culture. 

 
The arc of the School Renewal Program strategy: 
In order to attain high levels of achievement for all students in Renewal  schools we must build capacity to increase 
student achievement through the adoption of new attitudes and behaviors, research based strategies that improve 
teacher practice, coupled with the use of clear data driven supports for building students’ skills in the content areas and 
increasing student engagement. We are particularly prioritizing reading and writing across the curricula.  The use of 
student learning data will drive instruction through strong teacher teams; onsite, job embedded professional learning 
and problem solving, and accountability at all levels of the system:  central, district and school - for results. Renewal 
schools are provided with intensive training, leadership and pedagogical coaching, and structural supports, monitoring 
of implementation and ongoing feedback and revisions as needed. Further, each Renewal school will become a 
Community School and strategically partner with community based organizations (CBO) to integrate social services and 
expanded learning time into the fabric of the school to help them better serve the needs of students.  These schools will 
stand as centers of opportunities where families can get the supports they need to make sure students come to school 
ready and able to learn. 
 
Structure of the Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) 

The Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) will serve as the organizing and overarching document for 
each Renewal school and will be directly aligned and developed around the elements of the Framework for Great 
Schools, New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, and Strong Schools, 
Strong Communities, including the following: 

  Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks: Demonstrable improvement benchmarks located in the 2018-19 

RSCEP, in the Data and Accountability Snapshot page.  Receivership benchmarks have been closely aligned with 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          5 

 

the Renewal benchmarks so that schools will have one coherent set of improvement benchmarks to meet.  All 
Receivership Benchmarks are a subset of Renewal Benchmarks. While the targets for these overlapping 
benchmarks are not always identical, the Receivership Benchmark targets are always equal to or lower that the 
Renewal Benchmarks targets. That means that any school that meets its Renewal Benchmarks targets have by 
definition also met its Receivership Benchmarks targets. For additional information on Receivership 
demonstrable improvement benchmarks go here.  

  Establishing an overarching summative vision aligned with elements of the Framework for Great Schools and 

documenting key areas of celebration and renewal through analysis of assessments and by envisioning what the 
desired outcome for each school will be at the end of the School Renewal process.  

  Setting interim assessment benchmarks that create the path for improvement by focusing on desired outcomes 

and goals. In this way, the plan will be mapped to the overarching summative vision. In addition to the five 
discrete goals formed around the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, each school will create an 
action plan. 

  Transformation into a community school in order to increase student and family access to physical and mental 

health services and other social-emotional supports made available in or near the school. 

  Expanded learning opportunities for all students, including additional instruction provided during afterschool 

 

and/or summer programming provided in collaboration with community partners. 
Intensive professional development for all staff to ensure effective implementation of curriculum and 
instruction aligned to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and to support staff in effectively responding 
to the differentiated academic and social-emotional needs of all students. 
  Additional, focused strategies to increase parent and family engagement. 

 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Information on the Framework for Great Schools and the DTSDE 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and RSCEP Development 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          6 

 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive 
Educational Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for 
continuous improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing 
review and analysis of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement 
activities and strategies that improve outcomes for students. 
 

 
Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 
 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

1.  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
2.  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
3.  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
4.  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
5.  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
6.  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement 
 
NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4) 
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 
 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the RSCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the RSCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 

Next Steps for RSCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists in every Renewal school 

and meets all the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the American Institute of Research (AIR) needs 

assessment, the school’s updated NYSED accountability status and most current quantitative and qualitative 
data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.   

  Step 4: Create a summative vision for the elements of the Framework for Great Schools. 

  Step 5: Revisit your school’s current goals, and strategically create new goals informed by the needs 

assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART – Specific, 
Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you monitor 
progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you have identified, and will let your school 
community know when you have reached your goal.   

  Step 6: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section. Title I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement 

Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 8: Complete the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) and the Community School sections. 

  Step 9: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether strategies and activities outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust practices along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

In October 2018, James M. Kiernan School of Arts and Humanities (JHS 123) was awarded a five year Magnet School 
Assistance Program (MSAP) federal grant to convert JHS 123 into whole-school magnet program. During the fall of 
2018 the planning process for the development of theme-based magnet program and school rebranding efforts 
began. James M. Kiernan School of Arts and Humanities (JHS 123) will become known as The Bronx Urban 
Community STEAM Magnet School (JHS 123).  

JHS 123 strives to empower students with critical thinking skills and a sense of self-determination in their pursuit of 
academic excellence to prepare them for college and career. Through our content based liberal arts curriculum, JHS 
123, students graduate with knowledge of art history, musical literacy, as well as the ability to read, write, think 
critically and utilize innovative problem solving skills to address the issues plaguing our ever-changing society. In 
keeping with our current mission, we will adopt STEAM as our magnet theme, allowing the school to leverage our 
existing art focus to support a content-based, interdisciplinary instructional program in which students examine the 
ways in which technology and the arts impact our changing world.  

JHS 123 is a middle school located in the Soundview section on the South Bronx. Our current enrollment is 364; 74% 
are Hispanic, 23% are African American, 3% are Asian or Alaskan American. Twenty-eight percent of students are 
Limited English Proficient (LEP) and 28% are Students with Disabilities (SWD). Our attendance rate is impacted by 
several key factors. Many of our students, 24%, are in temporary/transitional housing or living in one apartment 
with multiple families. These housing factors in the community impact our attendance rates which fall below 90%; 
however, due to a number of attendance incentives targeting students who are chronically absent our average 
daily attendance for the 2016-2017 was 90.7%. 

According to the New Visions Heat Map, an attendance dashboard provided to Community Schools to help monitor 
and track interventions, 33% of our students were chronically absent. JHS 123 made minimal gains in student 
achievement in Mathematics (13% proficiency a 5% increase from 2015-2016) and English Language Arts (23% 
proficiency an 7% increase from 2015-2016). According to the NYC School Survey 2016-2017, 85% of parents 
responded positively responded positively to questions about Strong Family-Community Ties.  

Our challenges are to provide rigorous instruction to elevate student achievement using effective school leadership 
to foster collaborative teaching and to strengthen family community ties that will build stakeholders capacity to 
work towards the shared goal of improving student outcome. All special population students require flexible 
scheduling and knowledgeable pedagogues to deliver CCLS aligned curriculum and instructional practices. 
Additionally, in order to meet the needs of our students we need to provide supplementary support and resources 
such as regular access to innovated technology, life skills, and career experiences.  

JHS 123 will continue its designation as a Community School in partnership with Rising Ground (formerly Leake and 
Watts Services, Inc.). Through the Renewal/Community School process there will be a number of strategic

At The Bronx Urban Community STEAM Magnet School (J.H.S 123) we believe students learn best in a safe and 
respectful environment when the workshop model is employed. We believe that students learn best when they are 
presented with standards based content that provides them with frequent opportunities to read, speak and/or 
write critically. 

As part of our mission, The Bronx Urban Community STEAM Magnet School (JHS 123), believes that all students 
should graduate prepared for high school on the path for college and career readiness. Our school wide core values 
are family, accountability, creativity and excellence. In order to accomplish our mission and live our core values we 
are committed to align professional development, teacher performance and supervisory observations in a manner 
that will positively account for academic growth as evidenced by student performance on state assessments as well 
as formative and summative assessments in the classroom. Through meaningful professional development and 
supervision, our instructional goals will be addressed and monitored in order increase student performance. Our 
collaboration with our partners will help us achieve the overall mission of preparing students for their high school 
careers and future educational/employment goals. 

Through the Expanded Learning Time initiative we are able to provide students with a well rounded program that 
provides supplemental learning opportunities to students through academic enrichment and remediation.

4.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, 

Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review? 

JHS 123 was fully accepted into the Teachers College Reading and Writing Program (TCRWP) for the 2016-17 school 
year and has continued work with the program during the 2017-18 school year. The use of TCRWP reading and writing 
curriculum allowed us to solidify our successful implementation of a school wide balanced literacy/workshop model.  

As a result of the school’s adoption of this curriculum, the percentage of students who performed at levels 3 and 4 on 
the New York State (NYS) English Language Arts (ELA) assessment increased from 17 percent in 2015-2016, 23 percent 
in 2016-2017 to 25% in 2017-2018.  

Our initial analysis of 2017-2018 NYS ELA cut scores shows that 75% of the school met criteria. Our analysis of the 
2017 June Instructional Report show that our students are making growth in the majority of the ELA standards. Our 
6th graders made gains in 12 of the 17 standards that were assessed this year and last year. That’s progress made on 
71% of the standards. The progress made was an average of 9% points. We are only 12% points away from the City 
Average in Reading and 13% points away from the City Average in Writing. Our 7th graders made gains in 13 out of 14 
standards that were assessed this year and last year. That’s progress made on 93% of the standards. The progress 
made was an average of 8% points. We are only 9% points away from the City Average in Reading and 6% points away 
from the City Average in Writing. Our 8th graders made gains in 9 out of 16 standards that were assessed this year 
and last year. That’s progress made on 56% of the standards. The progress made was an average of 2% points. The 
8th grade students are only 1% point away from the City Average in Reading and out paced the City Average by 1 
percentage point in Writing. 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          17 

 

During the 2017-2018 school year, JHS 123 continued working with the National Training Network (NTN) for 
assistance with coaching and curriculum alignment for mathematics. As a result of this partnership, the percentage of 
students who performed at levels 3 and 4 on the NYS Mathematics Assessment nearly doubled from 7 percent in 
2015-2016, 13 percent in 2016-2017 to 16 percent in 2017-2018.  

Our initial analysis of 2017-2018 NYS Math cut scores shows that 78% of the school met criteria. Our analysis of the 
2017 June Instructional Report show that our students are making growth in the majority of the Math standards. Our 
6th graders made gains in 17 of the 24 common core strands that were assessed this year and last year. That’s 
progress made on 71% of the standards. Overall in math, 6th graders improved 13% points in comparison to the City 
Average and their achievement last year. Our 7th graders made gains in 12 of the 21 common core strands that were 
assessed this year and last year. That’s progress on 57% of the standards. Overall in math, 7th graders improved 2% 
points in comparison to the City Average and their achievement last year. Our 8th graders made gains in 20 of the 23 
strands that were assessed this year and last year. That’s progress on 87% of the standards. Overall in math, 8th 
graders improved 38% points in comparison to the City Average and their achievement last year. 

Feedback from the 2017-2018 New York State Education Department (NYSED) Integrated Intervention Team (ITT) visit 
noted that some departments successfully used pre-assessment data as an instructional tool to move students 
writing levels the practice of using data frequently and effectively has not been codified as a school-wide practice. 
This feedback has helped us craft our 2018-2019 instructional focus: If teachers effectively use data to differentiate 
instruction then we will see evidence of greater active student engagement or higher student achievement.  

In order to provide our teachers with the structures, supports and training needed to establish a data driven culture 
within our school then we will begin to collect and analyze data effectively to inform our instructional decisions and 
further increase student performance levels. We will provide professional development and incorporate regular 
rounds of looking at students work, creation of interventions and reassessment to check for mastery into our content 
team meetings. Additionally, we have scheduled additional RTI/I-Ready periods in which teachers will use I-Ready 
diagnostic data to teach common core aligned lessons that address student learning needs.  

In ELA we will move 45 students from level 1 to level 2 which will decrease the percent of level 1 students (based on 
our 2018-19 cohort’s most recent state test results) from 49% to 39%. We will move 58 students from level 2 to level 
3 which will increase the percent of level 3 and 4 students (based on our 2018-19 cohort’s most recent state test 
results) from 16% to 30%. In all we will move 103 students up one proficiency level which will allow us to meet our 
benchmark of 2.6 average proficiency rate in ELA. 

 

In Math we will move 53 students from level 1 to level 2 which will decrease the percent of level 1 students (based on 
our 2018-19 cohort’s most recent state test results) from 61% to 50%. We will move 26 students from level 2 to level 
3 which will increase the percent of level 3 and 4 students (based on our 2018-19 cohort’s most recent state test 
results) from 13% to 20%.In all we will move 79 students up one proficiency level which will allow us to meet our 
benchmark of 2.4 average proficiency rate in ELA. 

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Rigorous Instruction 

What is your school’s instructional focus? What is your vision for promoting the instructional focus consistently across 
classrooms?   
 

If teachers effectively use data to differentiate instruction then we will see evidence of greater active student 
engagement or higher student achievement.  

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          18 

 

The above instructional focus will be the tool that drives us throughout the school year. All of the decisions made in 
regards to inquiry, professional learning, systems and structures as well as academic interventions are planned and 
developed with the instructional focus in mind. 

All content area teachers will collect, analyze, and use a variety of data on student achievement to inform their 
instructional decisions and the administration will provide supports and training that establish a data-driven culture 
within the school that will impact student performance levels. 

As a Data Wise school, we will utilize the structures and supports that we are provided to ensure that we build an 
evidence-based culture of collaborative inquiry to make sense of data and ultimately use it to drive improvement. 
Grade and content teams will regularly use the data wise process to review data we collect internally to identify 
problems of practice and make instructional and pedagogical shifts and reflect on our progress/practice. 

Additionally, the administration team will have data talks with teachers at the end of every marking period to ensure 
that all teachers are collecting, analyzing and using data to inform small group work and promote student 
achievement. 

We will strengthen the success of our balanced literacy program by leveraging our partnership with TCRWP, by 
providing onsite and off site professional development opportunities to support teachers with curriculum 
development and pedagogy. We will strengthen the success of our Social Social curriculum and PBIScience curriculum 
by leveraging our partnerships with Lincoln Center Education, The New York Historical Society and Magnet Project 
Based Learning (PBL) curriculum development personnel.  

Our partnership with National training Network for Math which provides job embedded professional development 
and support with curriculum development that will strengthen the math department. The Envision Math curriculum 
will be embedded into NTN’s common core aligned scope and sequence. Teachers will deliver the instruction using 
the workshop model or the constructivist approach. To support teacher development in using the constructivist 
approach in mathematics, teachers will use the Five Practices in Mathematics as their professional resource along 
with NTN consultants. Additionally, we will incorporate Math journals to capture student writing. Each period of 
mathematics will have an element of student discourse which will be supported by writing. The math shifts (focus, 
fluency, application, and deep understanding) will be evident with coherence across the grades.  

Writing throughout all subjects will use the constructivist/workshop model aligned with the Passports to Social 
Studies Core Social Studies and the New York State Scope and Sequence for Science. The core subject areas will also 
employ the use of music and art. Teachers will be provided with professional development that will foster the use of 
fiction and non-fiction texts in all content subjects. 

All content area teachers will collect, analyze and use a variety of data on student achievement to inform their 
instructional decisions and the administration will provide supports and training that establish a data-driven culture 
within the school that will impact student performance levels. 

As a data wise school we will utilize the structures and supports that we are provided to ensure that we build an 
evidence-based culture of collaborative inquiry to make sense of data and ultimately use it to drive improvement. 
Grade and content teams will regularly use the data wise process to review data we collect internally to identify 
problems of practice and make instructional and pedagogical shifts and reflect on our progress/practice. 

Additionally, the admin team will have data talks with teachers at the end of every marking period to ensure that all 
teachers are collecting, analyzing and using data to inform small group work and promote student achievement.  

 

 

What is your vision for the implementation of CCLS-aligned curricula that meets the needs of your diverse learners, 
personally, academically, and culturally?  

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          19 

 

All of the curriculum programs outlined in the rigorous instruction action plan below were chosen because the 
curricula ensures that we are addressing Common Core ELA and Math standards and instructional shifts. 

Teachers College Reading and Writing curriculum provides a full alignment to the Common Core Learning Standards 
across grades and embeds key standards to address the ELA instructional shifts. The curriculum engages students in 
frequent close readings of complex fiction and non-fiction text and requires that students support their claims with 
text- based evidence throughout the school year in ELA, Social Studies and Science. Curriculum and academic tasks 
are standards based and differentiated to meet the needs of all learners. Passports to Social Studies Core Social 
Studies is our chosen standards based, common core aligned curriculum program that is supported by our TCRWP 
curriculum units and rubrics. Students have been taught to use annotations in both fiction and non-fiction complex 
text to show meta-cognition. Students were taught to use “R.A.C.E.” (Restate, Answer, Cite your evidence, and 
Explain) to answer short and extended response questions. English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities 
will be provided multiple entry points to the curriculum through the use of Lyric Studies and Painting Studies. 
Additionally, in the 2018-2019 school year teachers will incorporated the Teachers College Up the Ladder curriculum 
as an additional scaffold for students functioning below grade level.  

Our partnership with National training Network for Math, which provides job embedded professional development 
and support with curriculum development will strength the math department. NTN provides a common core aligned 
scope and sequence will be use to embed the Envision Math curriculum. Students are taught the "S.O.L.V.E" (study 
the problem, organize the facts, line up a plan, verify your plan, examine the results) problem-solving method to 
systematically approach and break down higher order thinking math problems. 

The Project-Based Inquiry Science (PBISci) curriculum. PBISci is a project-based curriculum that aligns to both the New 
York State Science Standards and Common Core Learning Standards. PBISci promotes higher order thinking skills, 
discussion, design and real-world application of learning standards to promote engagement and rigor. Real-world 
applications promote college and career readiness. Project based curriculum promotes student discussion and 
engagement. The hands-on aspect of the curriculum provides entry points for all learners including ELLs and SWDs. 

 

 

What is your vision for diverse program offerings that allow students to develop skills, habits, and behaviors to be 
career and college ready? How are instructional shifts embedded in this vision? 
The implementation of well designed planned lessons that employ the workshop model or the constructivist 
approach across all classroom will ensure that students develop the communication, collaboration, and critical 
thinking skills and behaviors needed to be college and career ready. Whether using the workshop or constructivist 
model we expect our students to frequently engage in well planned standards based learning tasks/activities that 
allow them to think creativity, critically, collaboratively and communicate through discussion and writing. 
Additionally, teachers are encouraged to incorporate frequent work reflections and goals settings into their lesson 
plans to ensure that students are engaging in reflection and revision of their academic goals. 

Based on teacher recommendations and state testing results, we have identified students in eighth grade with the 
readiness to take the Living Environment Regents. We have eighth grade Science teachers providing instruction to 
this targeted group to ensure that our students are receiving the instruction needed to be successful in passing the 
Regents Examination. Additionally, we will identify a group of incoming sixth graders with the readiness to take 
integrated Algebra by eighth grade and provide them with the instruction needed to ensure they will successfully 
pass the Algebra regents exam in eighth grade. 

Through the Expanded Learning Time initiative we are able to provide students with a well rounded program that 
provides supplemental learning opportunities to students through academic enrichment and remediation. 

During our Expanded Learning Time students will be able to engage in Regents preparation for both Living 
Environment and Integrated Algebra and participate in a socratic seminar style class in which they will be exposed to

high school level texts and writing tasks. In addition, remediation support will be provided for our students with 
disabilities and all others identified as in need of remediation support services. 

 

 

What do you envision the delivery of instruction to look like so that all students are set up for success?  
The continued implementation of well designed planned lessons that employ the workshop model or the 
constructivist approach across all classroom will ensure that students develop the skills, habits and behaviors needed 
to be successful. Whether using the workshop or constructivist model we expect our students to frequently engage in 
well planned standards based learning tasks/activities that allow them to think creativity, critically, collaboratively 
and communicate through discussion and writing. 

Teacher are expected to use a variety of formative and summative checks for understanding (shared time for student 
reflection, cold calls, exit tickets, checklists/rubrics, red and green light system, thumbs up/down etc.) frequently 
throughout the lesson and unit to assure that students are on the right track. Teachers will use that data to 
conference with students and provided them with timely, actionable feedback, and next steps.  

In addition, to the enrichment and remediation classes that students participate in during extended learning time, 
academic Interventions for targeted students will be supported by iReady online intervention program in both ELA 
and Math throughout the day. 

 

 

How do you envision teachers using multiple entry points to ensure the success of every child? 
Teachers will continue to utilize various teaching and learning strategies, differentiation strategies to provide 
students with multiple entry points. Differentiate instruction stems for frequent and ongoing assessment of students 
to determine their individual needs. All teachers will use in class formative assessments that will determine what the 
instructional priorities are during a lesson and/or a unit. Teachers will analyze the units summative assessment to 
determine what skills they need to re-teach and spiral into the following units. 

Teachers will use a variety of strategies to scaffold assignments ranging from center learning, conferring, tiered 
lessons, varied reference charts, organizers etc. to ensure that all students are successful with grade level material. 
Additionally, teachers will receive in-school staff development days on how to use Teachers College Reading And 
Writing progressions to meet the needs of diverse learners while still infusing the rigor of grade level material. 

Lastly, infusing arts based instruction (lyric study, painting study, political cartoons etc.) into our content areas classes 
as frequently as possible will provide an entry point for all students.  

 

 

What is your vision for the use of a comprehensive assessment strategy (diagnostic, formative, benchmark, and 
summative) to drive curricular, instructional, and organizational decisions that impact student outcomes? 
One of our main instructional priorities for 2018-2019 year is to collect, analyze, and use a variety of data on student 
achievement to inform our instructional decisions and practices. The administration is dedicated to providing support 
and training to establish a data-driven culture within the school that will increase student performance levels. 

 

Teachers meet weekly in content area teams for 90 minutes in order to plan lessons/units with quality utilize 
formative/summative assessments in which they can use the data to make instructional changes, analyze student 
work and plan collaboratively. These sessions occur within and across grades and are supported by National Training 
Network coaches, Teacher College instructional coaches, administrators, and Director of School Renewal for District 
8. The intended impact is for teachers to plan deliberately and strategically to group students by utilizing the 
formative data and tracked the progress. 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          21 

 

As a Data Wise school, we will utilize the structures and supports that we are provided to ensure that we build an 
evidence-based culture of collaborative inquiry to make sense of data and ultimately use it to drive improvement. 
Grade and content teams will regularly use the Data Wise inquiry cycle to review data we collect internally to identify 
problems of practice and make instructional and pedagogical shifts and reflect on our progress/practice. In addition, 
to the enrichment and remediation classes that students participate in during extended learning time, academic 
Interventions for targeted students will be supported by iReady online intervention program in both ELA and Math

In 2015-2016 our school community began to make tremendous strides towards becoming a safe and supportive 
environment for all community stakeholders. We were officially removed from the persistently dangerous list and 
ended the 2015-2016 school year with a Violent and Disruptive Incident Reporting [VADIR] score of 1.11 a significant 
decrease from the 2014-2015 2.09 score. In 2016-2017 we continued this success and strides as our OORS data 
showed an increase in level 1-3 infractions reported and a decrease in level 4 and 5 infractions. This trend shows that 
we are taking a proactive approach to discipline issues in which we address lower level offenses quickly so we could 
avoid more serious offenses. 2017-2018 VADIR score was 1.2.  

We met 2016 – 2017 daily average attendance goal of 91% an increase from 2015-2016 average daily attendance of 
90.3% due to the commitment of our attendance team and CBOs. Our ELA teams collaborative spirit and willingness 
to create a professional learning community resulted in the remarkable gains made in students proficiency levels (5 % 
to 17 %) on the ELA state exam.  

In 2017-2018, we continued our work towards creating a safe and supportive environment for students and families. 
Our quality review the past two years has highlighted school culture and climate as an area of celebration. We saw a 
decrease in overall attendance to 90.7%.  

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          27 

 

We are looking to decrease our chronic absenteeism numbers this year with more targeted mentoring which will also 
help to increase overall attendance to our previous numbers. Any student that is absent 3 consecutive days without a 
doctor’s note or significant reasoning will receive a home visit via our attendance coordinator or attendance teacher. 
Any student that receives a home visit (home visits are parent conversations related) will have a conversation with a 
member of the community room, social worker or guidance counselor to discuss attendance and supports the student 
might need going forward. Any student that is absent more than 3 days in a month will be flagged to discuss 
attendance status at the attendance meeting for next steps. Any student that is labeled as SCA or CA (in addition to 
families in high need, STH or High Risk student behaviorally) will be invited to an invite only community dinner where 
families will mingle with each other, staff members and short presentations from the floating hospital and our 
attendance teacher. The goal is to build community, share information and share positive words of encouragement 
for each student.  

We are gearing up to implement RULER from the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence in partnership with our 
current Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports System (PBIS). It is marked by incentive based activities for 
students along with the creation of classroom charter documents aligned to our schools goals and visions for creating 
a positive and safe culture and tone. There is still inconsistency in the implementation of practices (PBIS) that support 
it amongst staff. This inconsistency has led to teacher and classroom management issues has lead to frustrations on 
how behavior incidents are dealt with and lack of student buy in for PBIS.  

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Supportive Environment 

What is your vision for a supportive school environment? How will you in partnership with each CBO and families 
enact your vision? 
 

By the end of the 2018-19 school year stakeholders should describe a place where all students are encouraged to 
strive for excellence academically, socially, and emotionally in a safe and supportive atmosphere. A place that works 
in a partnership with our parents and community to create an environment where students are empowered to 
discover their strengths and to achieve their maximum potential.  

Our CBOs Rising Ground (formerly Leake and Watts Services, Inc.) and City Year New York will act in a capacity to both 
improve the academic progress and support emotional and social growth by the assignment of a one full time social 
worker and graduate level social work interns. Student voice and leadership will be supported by student 
government. We will use PBIS system in collaboration with RULER from Yale’s Center for Emotional Intelligence as our 
social emotional learning framework to lower the suspension rates, improve attendance, and academic intellect.  

The school will continue the work of our PPT/SIT Team to identify students with unmet social and emotional needs 
and create a plan to meet these students’ needs. The PPT/SIT Team will review the progress of identified students on 
a bi-weekly basis as well as attendance data. The PPT/SIT Team will also review OORS data on a monthly basis to 
compare student incidents in relation to the same time period from 2017-18. Our school will be proactive in teaching 
students how to respond in social situations. The school will institute a system for keeping good records on students 
(i.e.: behavior, connection, with parents). 

The attendance policies in place will be refined address student lateness and absence including appropriate 
intervention by the Classroom Teacher, Dean and Administration. Any student that falls in the 90% or below 
attendance categories will be assigned a success mentor that will commit to weekly check-in’s and a daily greeting 
and will let the attendance team and social work team know if they need additional services or support. 

There will be an effort to better utilize the services of the Parent Coordinator, City Year New York Attendance Focus 
List, and the resources of Rising Ground to support student attendance and family crisis situations which negatively 
impact student general deportment in school.

Part 6 – Progress Monitoring  

Part 6a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
Similar to your Annual Goal, your mid-point benchmark should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound. 
By February 2019, 55% of students who were flagged by PBIS and Attendance Team for chronic absenteeism will 
increase overall daily attendance by 3% points as a result of the PBIS Team creating incentives and addressing social-
emotional needs that impact attendance. 

 
Part 6b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. 
To assess progress towards the annual goal ATS will be monitored by the RSAL daily report to show overall year-to-
date attendance. The Community School Director will also monitor data in the Data Sorter provided by The Office of 
Community Schools.

Tenet 4 Statement of Practice 
Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan. 
4.2  School and teacher leaders ensure that instructional practices and strategies are organized 

around annual, unit, and daily lesson plans that address all student goals and needs. 

4.3  Teachers provide coherent, and appropriately aligned Common Core Learning Standards 

(CCLS)-based instruction that leads to multiple points of access for all students. 

4.4  Teachers and students work together to implement a program/plan to create a learning 

environment that is responsive to students’ varied experiences and tailored to the strengths 
and needs of all students. 

4.5  Teachers inform planning and foster student participation in their own learning process by 

using a variety of summative and formative data sources (e.g., screening, interim measures, 
and progress monitoring).

Identify the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this section. 

3. 
4.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, 

Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review? 

 

Based on the initial results of the 2017-2018 Quality Review teacher teams were rated proficient consistent with fact 
that teacher teams was noted as a area of celebration during the 2016-2017 Quality Review.  

Additionally, according to the 2016-2017 School Quality Guide, 100% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed "that at 
their school teachers talk with one another about instruction" and 82% of teacher responded that "a lot or all 
teachers at their school are actively trying to improve their teaching."  

This year all content area teams met once a week for 90 minutes for common planning time. After our teachers meet 
weekly in content area teams for 90 minutes in order to plan lessons/units collaboratively and analyze students work. 
These sessions occur within and across grades and are supported by National Training Network coaches, Teacher 
College instructional coaches, administrators, and Director of School Renewal for District 8. The intended impact is for 
teachers to plan deliberately and strategically to group students by utilizing the formative data and tracked the 
progress. 

Feedback from the 2017-2018 New York State Education Department (NYSED) Integrated Intervention Team (ITT) led 
us to institute multiple rounds of looking at student work protocol across all content teams. During these rounds 
teachers in each content team collaborated to pick a standard/assignment they wanted to focus on, taught the 
standard and assessed students mastery. After carefully analyzing student work/data to identify mastery teachers 
developed small group instructional plans based on data analysis and incorporate scaffolds/supports that allow all

students to access the curriculum. This cycle was completed three times and results were shared with admin team at 
instructional cabinet.  

Targeted professional development and constant coaching is essential to strengthen the instructional core and 
establishing a collaborative professional learning community atJHS 123. Our commitment to distributive leadership 
extends well beyond the three-person administrative team and demands that we make a concerted effort to 
strengthen a cross section of teams composed of administration, faculty, staff, and CBO partners. In order to use the 
instructional cabinet and transformation team as a vehicle for change 90 meetings will be scheduled during the 
school day. 

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Collaborative Teachers 

What is your vision for collaborative teaching?   

 

All teacher teams will collaborate to plan workshop and/or constructivist common core aligned units/lessons, analyze 
student work/data to identify trends/misconceptions, revise instructional plans based on data analysis and 
incorporate scaffolds/supports that allow all students to access the curriculum. All teacher teams will successfully use 
the Data Wise protocols and process to identify problems of practice and make instructional and pedagogical shifts 
and reflect on our progress/practice. 

 

 
 

How do you envision collaboration amongst your School Instructional Cabinet to improve teacher practices and 
student learning? 
The instructional cabinet consist of department team teacher leaders who will meet weekly to discuss 
implementation of school wide curriculum initiatives. 

As a cabinet, we have agreed to participate in the Data Wise inquiry cycle instructional rounds so we can practice the 
process before we introduce it to our department teams. We will utilize the Data Wise protocols, structures, and 
supports to build an evidence-based culture of collaborative inquiry, to make sense of data and ultimately use it to 
drive school-wide improvement in teaching and learning. After the cabinet has completed each step of the Data Wise 
inquiry process department leaders will begin to turnkey the process with their department teams to identify 
problems of practice and complete the Data Wise inquiry cycle. 

 

 

How do you envision collaboration within teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?  
By June 2019, all teachers teams will have completed one Data Wise inquiry cycle in which they will collaboratively 
identify a problem of practice based on student work analysis and create an action plan to address the problem 
within their classrooms. Teachers will participate in peer observations and use protocols to analyze student work to 
evaluate if their action plan impacted student learning. 

 

 

How do you envision collaboration across teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?  
Monday professional development sessions will be utilized for teams across the school to share and reflect on 
individual departments Data Wise journey and findings.

Additionally, the norms, protocols and structures used in through Data Wise in department meetings will be used for 
whole staff professional development sessions in which we analysis a variety of data from pre and post tests, item 
analysis, Ready benchmark and TC running records to plan for individual student needs. 

 
What data will teachers and the School Instructional Cabinet regularly review to ensure that they are reflecting upon 
their teaching practices and meeting individual student learning needs?  What is the intent for reviewing each piece of 
data? (ex. Teachers will regularly review student IEPs when developing lessons in order to ensure that tasks are 
appropriately scaffolded.)

4.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, 

Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review? 

 

Our commitment to distributive leadership extends well beyond the three-person Admin team. We are committed to 
ensuring that we empower our teacher leaders and instructional cabinet members to have a voice in key decisions.  

Based on the initial results of the 2017-2018 Quality Review teacher teams and leadership development was rated 
proficient. 

Feedback from the 2017-2018 New York State Education Department (NYSED) Integrated Intervention Team (ITT) 
stated that the administration needs to pick a few targeted professional development priorities that will maximize 
resources in order to strengthen pedagogy across the school and communicate these priorities with all stakeholders, 
and ensure that all staff receive the support and the supervision they need to implement the priorities with fidelity.  

The administration needs to develop cycles of targeted instructional supervision that is timely, comprehensive, and 
supportive of teacher growth. 

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Effective School Leadership 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

What is your vision for effective school leadership at your school? 

 

The Principal and administrative cabinet will continuously articulate the shared vision and mission to the entire 
school community by using various strategies: present school wide goals to staff, staff handbook, at vertical and 
horizontal team meetings.  

Principal will ensure the CBO partnership is strong by programming meeting times with Community School Director to 
discuss ongoing concerns. The Admin Team will define clear roles of accountability of support staff and teachers in 
respect to assignment of duties and effective communication and planning. 

The leader will establish roles for each member of the community during the summer months of 2018 and deliver the 
information to the entire community in September during opening of school. The Principal will delegate 
responsibilities to the Assistant Principals and Community School Director. They will be responsible for 
communicating weekly goals in advance and keeping the Principal informed as they meet their deadlines and 
obligations to ensure a mutual exchange of information.  

The Admin team will continue to employ the cycle of observations according to the teacher contract and Advance, 
however, there will be an increased role in supervision in professional menu activities to ensure that teacher teams 
are conducting effective planning and responding effectively to student needs. As per the ITT 2017-2018 feedback the 
administrative team will develop a schedule for bi-monthly instructional rounds. The instructional rounds should 
focus on building individual capacity and collective teacher practice on the learning priorities articulated by admin 
team. Actionable written feedback will be provided bi-weekly to each teacher observed and lessons learned will be 
shared with all staff members.  

 

 
 

On which aspects of your own leadership do you plan to focus for the upcoming school year? 
 

This year I would like to focus on setting clear roles and responsibilities for each members of the school community. I 
would like all of this information shared with all stakeholders so as a school community we are aware of works done 
by others to be able to help support and praise jobs well done. Additionally, I would like to create systems and 
structures for tracking and holding people accountable to be established. 

 

 

What is your vision for ensuring that everyone in your schools has a normed and shared understanding of the school’s 
vision, mission, and instructional focus?  
 

Each content team will have one lead teacher who will act as the department leader and each grade team will have 
one lead teacher act as grade team leader. Department team and grade team leaders will be members of the 
instructional cabinet and meet with Admin team bi-monthly to monitor progress toward our CEP’s goals, discuss 
community issues and agendas items for department/grade team meetings. The department and grade team leaders 
will work with Admin team to ensure that a shared understanding of schools vision and instructional focus is being 
messaged.

What is your vision for developing differentiated leadership throughout your school? How will you utilize teacher 
leaders to build broad capacity within your school?  
The instructional cabinet (administrators and department leaders) has agreed to participate in the Data Wise inquiry 
process so we can practice the process before we introduce it to our department teams. We will utilize the Data Wise 
protocols, structures and supports to build an evidence-based culture of collaborative inquiry, to make sense of data 
and ultimately use it to drive school wide improvement in teaching and learning. After the cabinet has completed 
each step of the Data Wise inquiry process department leaders will begin to turnkey the process with their 
department teams to identify problems of practice and complete the Data Wise process. 

 

Additionally, teachers who participate in outside professional development opportunities will meet with 
administrators and department leaders upon their return to development a plan for the teacher to share their 
learning with other members of their department on Mondays during professional development meetings.  

 

 

How will the leader foster collaborative school governance processes, and ensure full family participation together 
with other stakeholders? 
 

Strengthen the school leadership team by inviting JHS 123's diverse stakeholders (parents, students, teachers, 
community based organization members, administrators etc.) to meaningfully participate in the governance of the 
school, monitor progress toward our SCEP’s goals, and cultivate authentic leadership.

How will you organize student and teacher programs to ensure students’ needs are met? Fiscal capital?  

All teachers have weekly department meetings, grade team meeting, common planning time built into their schedules. 
We have reorganized our teacher programs to ensure that students in ICT classes receive 30 periods of co-teaching. All 
students will be programmed for 10 periods of math, 12 periods ELA and 4 ELA enrichment periods. Two of the four 
enrichment periods will be dedicated to the non-fiction close reading and writing and co-taught by a content area 
teacher and an ELA teacher. Additionally, all students will be programmed for at least one period of AIS remediation 
and/or enrichment per week.

How  will  your  school  engage  parents/families  and  support  their  understanding  of  Effective  School  Leadership  and 
strategies  to  promote  parent  leadership  and  engagement  in  order  to  support  their  children  at  home?  Include  the 
timeline and identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
We understand the importance of parent leadership and engagement to help increase our students' academic 
successes. Our Parent Coordinator and CBO Rising Ground (formerly Leake and Watts) will work to engage parents in 
learning opportunities in partnership to provide concrete examples of how parents can support learning at home. 
They will leverage knowledge and materials from our RTI plan to provide parents with the individualized learning 
plans for their students along with workshops provided by our content team members. Our team of parent 
engagement individuals will also leverage our partnership with FACE, in particular, our outreach specialist to help 
enroll more parents in their leadership development program.

Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review? 

 

There is an “open door policy” for all community members and builds respectful relationships by sponsoring frequent 
activities. Our first family event this year was a success with 75 families attending our full sixth grade orientation 
before the first day of school. We hope to continue that momentum by continuing to implement a five point 
communication system for parent/home outreach: back pack information with students, mail information, phone 
banking campaigns, use of School Messenger system and REMIND text for mass messages. We have seen an increase 
of 25% in parent responses on the NYC School Survey over the past three years.  

Based on the 2016 Quality Review findings the school has many systems in place to cultivate a trusting relationship 
with families and to provide ongoing communication. While parents said they were pleased with the school only 3% 
of parents completed the 2016 NYC School Survey online. During the school year 2017 - 2018, 55% of our families 
participated in at least one school wide event (conferences, workshops, volunteering, informal parent gatherings 
and/or school-wide celebrations) according to our in-house records.  

While the school has structures and systems in place to provide ongoing communication to parents, according to 
parent feedback during our Community School Forum, there is a need to improve our system to address 
communicating detailed student performance data to families, many of whom lack computer access and/or literacy 
or are not proficient English. In addition, we need to help build our parents capacity to engage in reciprocal ongoing 
communication with the school about their children’s’ strengths and areas of challenge.

Part 2 – Summative Vision for Strong Family and Community Ties 

What is your vision for having strong family and community ties at your school? 

 

Families will be welcome in the school and made a part of the school community through the PA , parent workshops, 
personalized outreach, and dedicated Community Room.  

Student ambassadors will be nominated to welcome families and guests into the school. Students will meet parents 
and greet them, give them information about the various programs, and tour of the school during various open house 
or parent engagement programs. School Safety will sign them in and call for an ambassador to meet them. This 
process will help to create a welcoming environment at our school.  

To provide support to families so that they understand and can take an active role in what their child is learning a 
monthly grade team newsletter with a Principal's message, upcoming events at the school and the DOE will be listed, 
and community resources will be shared. Parents will also have access and training on how to use to our school’s 
online grading program, Skedula/Pupilpath so that they can obtain real time information about their child’s academic 
progress, conduct, and attendance. During our first meeting with parents we will review the student data, grading 
and state exams. In addition, we will provide training on how to navigate our schools online support tools (i.e., Pupil 
Path online grading system, etc.) to access and understand student data and progress.  

The CBO will host fairs and celebrations as a culminating project for significant units of study in all content areas. 
These events will build support and capacity in understanding the importance of independent reading and helping 
parents understand the impact of exposure to words and content through reading.  

With Rising Ground (formerly Leake and Watts Services, Inc.) we will have the opportunity to not only engage with 
families but also support their needs. The work of the CBO will align with the support services that the guidance 
counselors and school based support team provide for students. As part of this work, there will be workshops that 
will provide families with a better understanding of the educational system, the importance of student progress, and 
student socio-emotional growth. 

 

 

Within the Community School model, how will families be welcomed into the school and made a part of the school 
community?  What support will administrators, teachers, school staff and school safety officers be given to help create 
a welcoming environment?   Will there be a dedicated space for families in the school? 
 
A dedicated space, the Community Room, has been created in the school building to help welcome families into the 
school community. The room is outfitted to provide a comfortable space for families to meet one another, hold 
meetings, and use open technology for personal use. New signage will be throughout the entrance of the school 
building to help families navigate the building and direct them to the Community Room during their visit. The Family 
Engagement Specialist in partnership with the Parent Coordinator will provide support to administrators, teachers, 
and school safety officers in how to best engage family members during school visits. These parties will also help 
direct families to the Community Room and the resources available within its walls.  

 

 

 How will the school identify and develop families to take leadership roles in school decision making/school 
governance structures?

The school will lean on the lead CBO Rising Ground (formerly Leake and Watts Services, Inc.) with its Parent 
Engagement Specialist (PES). The PES helps to foster and develop parent leaders in partnership with the FACE Office. 
It is the hope that these parents leaders will move into leadership roles over the course of the school year. During the 
2017 – 2018 three parent leaders graduated from the FACE Leadership Program it is our goal to increase that number 
for the 2018 – 2019 school year.  

 

 
 

How will the school engage the community and families? How will they ensure that teachers are able to learn from 
families about the children being taught? 
 

School will engage the community and families by various means including Pupil Path, the RemindApp, regular 
mailings, and backpacked flyers. It will sponsor workshops and other learning opportunities to help both teachers 
and parents work together to support students' learning both inside and outside of the classroom. 

Rising Ground (formerly Leake and Watts Services, Inc.) will sponsor over the course of the year several engagement 
activities to help give teachers and families an opportunity to meet one another and build positive working 
relationships.

child is learning?

Section 6: Expanded Learning Time (ELT) Program Description 

 

Directions: Expanded Learning Time (ELT) activities are directly aligned to the elements of the Framework for Great 
Schools, Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environments, and Strong Family and Community Ties. ELT provides enriching 
educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship-
building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and 
extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring 
that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200 
additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of 
instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in 
grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced 
curriculum that can include ELA, math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development. Complete the sections 
on this page to demonstrate how the school will meet these requirements.  
 
Part 1 – ELT Program Goal(s) 

Describe the summative goal(s) of the ELT program for the 2018-19 school year. Goals for ELT should align to the 
Renewal Benchmarks.  How will the school will ensure that all students’ individual needs are served during the 
Renewal ELT and how the school’s vision for ELT will impact both academic achievement and social emotional 
growth? Be sure to construct the goal to be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
By June 2019, the ELT program will support an average increase of 2-3 grade levels on students TC running records by 
providing an additional hour of literacy instruction and practice Tuesday through Friday.  

 

 
Part 2 – ELT Program Type 

Is the ELT program voluntary or compulsory?

Additional ELT - If there is a voluntary ELT program in addition to the compulsory Renewal ELT, indicate how you will 
actively encourage the participation of all students, with the goal of serving at least 50% of students. 
The school will schedule the ELT as an extension of the school day (period 9) increasing academic periods. As a result, 
the school will have a minimum of 90.3% attendance rate.  

 

 
Part 3 – ELT Program Description 

Target Population: The ELT program for a Renewal School will be offered to all students in the school. 

Describe how the school will meet the following SED requirements for an ELT program: 
How will the school integrate academics, enrichment, and skill development through hands-on experiences that make 
learning relevant and engaging?   
How will CBO staff and the school’s teachers be integrated to provide a seamless learning day? 

  Offer a range of activities that capture student interest and strengthen student engagement in learning so as 

to promote higher attendance, reduces risk for retention or drop out, and increases the likelihood of 
graduation. 

  Actively address the unique learning needs and interests of all types of students, especially those who may 

benefit from approaches and experiences not offered in the traditional classroom setting. 

  What new content areas and opportunities will be offered to students? How will the school ensure all IEP and 

language mandates are met during ELT? 

  Contain components designed to improve student academic, social, and emotional outcomes, including 

opportunities for enrichment programs such as in music and art. 

  Ensure instruction in any core academic subject offered in the program will be delivered under the 

supervision of a teacher who is NYS certified in that particular content area.

  How will community educators receive professional development?  Are there plans to provide joint PD to 

school faculty and community partner staff? 

  What content will be led by pedagogical staff and what content will be led by CBO partners? 
  How will the school best utilize CBO partners to impact student achievement? 
  How will effective outreach be conducted to families? 
  How will programming be made easily accessible to students and families in order to encourage 

participation? 

By the 2018-19 school year the school will be work with CBOs to provide ELA/Math enrichment during the ELT. City 
Year New York AmeriCorps members will use Scholastic Reading Inventory and Scholastic Math Inventory along with 
ELA and Math Ready Assessment scores to identify students who would most benefit from small group instruction.  

The City Year New York AmeriCorps will have targeted focus list students in both ELA and Math. Classroom teachers 
will also work with students to provide literacy and math remediation and/or enrichment. Additionally, ELT will be 
included in the school’s PBIS program to promote the students’ social emotional well-being .  

City Year New York will be working exclusively with 6th - 8th graders during ELT and select and track students through 
the use of 3 focus lists:  

1. Socio -Emotional Learning Focus List ( SEL )  

● These students will be identified by Guidance Counselors, School Social Workers, School Staff, and data reviewed in 
the Attendance Heat Map as being able to benefit from a mentoring relationship with an adult. 

2. Attendance Focus List  

● Students on an attendance focus list are students who fall into 80% - 89% ADA range from the previous school year. 
The goal is to get students to 90% ADA range by the end of the year. These students will be identified using the 
Attendance Heat Map.  

3. ELA Focus List  

● City Year will use three data points to determine a focus list of students for ELA :  

o Assessment TC Running Record  

o Previous school year's ELA report card grade 

o Previous school year's ELA state test score 

● Students are eligible to be put on a City Year ELA focus list if they:  

o received a letter grade of an "F," "D," or "C" on their previous school year's ELA report card grade 

o received a "1" or a "2" on their previous school year's ELA state test score 

● The goal is to have students improve two consecutive marking periods in their letter grade by the end of the year as 
well as improving in their assessment scores.

activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work. 
Renewal Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and 
services, as determined by the asset and needs  assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time 
(ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the 
right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly 
coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day. 
Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to 
strengthen this initiative. 
Renewal Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and families 
feel welcome,  actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of their 
schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community 
School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this  family 
engagement strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Renewal School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (RSCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/RSCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 11: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. I.S. 123 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

I.S. 123 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

· providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

· providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

· fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

· providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

· sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

· providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

· actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

· engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated directly 
to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

· ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

· support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
At IS 123, the majority of our ENL students are Spanish speakers although we have students 
with low incidence languages such as Bengali, Fulani and Hindi. The school has two ESL 
certified teachers, Mr. Powell and Ms. Perch,  and support staff to meet the academic and 
social/emotional needs of our ENL students. We also have Spanish speaking students who are 
proficient in both English and Spanish to work with and support ENL students in class through 
the use of strategic grouping and heterogeneous partnerships. Instruction is delivered in English 
and at times teachers translate directions and assignments into Spanish to ensure that all students 
have access to the curriculum.   
We will use the Title III funding to purchase the `Getting Ready for 
the NYSESLAT Curriculum to provide our ENL students with intensive, small group instruction 
at their current language levels. This intervention program will be implemented after school four 
times a week for one hour and 15 minutes, which will be lead by ESL providers, Ms. Perch and 
Mr. Powell. The program will take place on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday during 
the months of January, February and March. 
Since the majority of our ENL's scored at the Transitioning and Expanding levels of the 
NYSESLAT, in order to meet their language needs, we plan to implement I-Ready and Duo 
Lingo web-based programs throughout After School Program. Due to the the fact that we are a 
middle school, the majority of our ENL's come to us as Long Term ENL's and are in the fourth 
or fifth year of service. They struggle in the area of English Language Arts due to the challenges 
of the high cognitive demands of reading and writing at the middle school level. Our goal is to 
build academic vocabulary, fluency and stamina through the use of I-Ready, Duo Lingo and 
NYSESLAT Test Preparation which ENL's can use in school and at home.  
In addition, ENL's are expected to pass the Math exam for promotional consideration. Our 
school has purchased and will implement a math I-ready online program. This program is 
designed to assess student's math ability and corresponding grade level and then will provide 
explicit instruction to move the student up to grade level ability.

2. District 8 Monthly Liason Meetings 
3. Any applicable PD's offered in the Bronx Field Support Center (Fall Catalog)  
4. NYSESLAT and Beyond: Targeted and Strategic (K - 8)  
During this professional learning cycle, participants will focus on instructional strategies that 
teachers can embed in their daily lessons to ensure student progress in both content and language 
acquisition. Participants will develop a toolkit of instructional strategies targeted to support 
improved language skills, which include developing an understanding of the Targets of 
Measurement (ToMs) and the Performance Level Descriptors (PLD's) and to understand the 
requirements of the NYSESLAT and plan lessons that address the rigorous linguistic demands. 
5. Advanced Literacy for ELL's Institute (K - 8)  
During this professional cycle, participants will build knowledge in the Advance Literacy reform 
to identify instructional challenges and high-support approaches that meet the needs of 
linguistically and culturally diverse students. Participants will adapt lessons using the Four 
Hallmarks of Advanced Literacy as a reference. 
6. Mistaken Identity: Second Language Acquisition vs. Learning Disability (K - 12)  
During this professional learning cycle, participants will deepen their understanding on the new 
mandate as per NYSED CR-part 154 to form a Language Proficiency Team (LPT). Members of 
the LPT are charged with the responsibility of determining whether a student has a learning 
disability (LD) vs. a language acquisition (LA) need at the time of new registration.   
7. English as a New Language/Bilingual Teacher Institute (K - 8) During this professional 
learning cycle, participants will engage in protocols with colleagues to maximize sharing and 
resource gathering as they work to plan for and to support ELL's. At the end of this professional 
development cycle, participants will develop effective systems for planning and supporting 
ELL's as well as utilizing ELL resources to modify their curriculum units of study.  
8. Best Practices on How to Program ELL's to Ensure Section 154 Compliance  
During this session, participants will use the NYSED Units of Study and Staffing requirements, 
in order for schools to program ELL students according to their proficiency levels and mandated 
minutes of instruction. This will be a hands-on session in an open lab where participants will 
acquire the skills needed in regards to the technical aspect of programming the ELL students.

Workshops 
Research demonstrates that parental involvement has a direct impact on student achievement. In 
order to ensure that parents of ENL's are involved, we provide translated materials. We also 
reach out to parents directly and work on providing a warm and comfortable atmosphere.  
To promote greater involvement of parents of our ENL population, our Parent Coordinator, Mr. 
Robles, who is bilingual, will reach out to parents of ENL's to attend Parent Workshops, School 
Events, Parent Teacher Association/School Leadership Team meetings and Parent Teacher

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
In order to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs, we use TC Running Records to evaluate students' independent and 
instructional reading levels in English. In addition, we also use Fountas and Pinnell texts to determine language ability.  For 
incoming Spanish-speaking students we use the Spanish LAB to assess native language skills and the NYSITELL results to 
determine knowledge of the English language.  Once students' reading levels have been determined, they are grouped either 
homogeneously or heterogeneously, depending on the number of ELLs per class.  Teachers also use this information to drive 
instruction when differentiating activities and configuring groupings of ELLs for individual lessons.  We have ELLs with skills 
ranging from pre-primer to grade level. Our beginner ELLs are given additional ENL support and native language support in the 
content areas. If available, we also use any Spanish-speaking City Year core members and/or CBO volunteers, and language 
paras in as many content area classes as permitted.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          78 

 

 

We have a coach from Teachers College working with teachers to ensure the calibration of conducting TC Running 
Records.  Additionally, our ELL coordinator will meet with our two ENL teachers once per week individually, and once per week 
as a team to provide additional support. In these meetings, the ELL Coordinator will work with the ENL providers using the 
Language Progressions and TC curriculum to tailor specific lessons for the Push-in component of ENL services. The ENL 
teachers have received initial training on the use of the Recipe for Reading Language Acquisition program which will be used 
for all Pull Out services. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We evaluate the overall success of our ELLs based on scores on their NYSESLAT and NYS Exam assessments. On a yearly basis 
almost 58% of our students make progress on the NYSESLAT.  However, the targets have risen from 62% to 69.6% over the last 
seven years. We have not been able to meet AMAO1 based on our NYSESLAT data. This shows that ELLs are making progress 
but not enough progress to meet the target. ENL teachers will disaggregate the data to identify the at-risk ELLs who need 
additional supports and interventions. In regards to achieving proficiency on the NYSESLAT, I.S. 123 has met that target for the 
last seven years. In regards to this indicator it should be noted that the NYSESLAT has become progressively more difficult each 
year as it is aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. We are aware that our level has remained stagnant over the last 
few years. For 2015-2016 and beyond, the ENL teachers are going to target students or subgroups of students for additional 
support (e.g. after school) in order to prepare them for the increasing demands of English proficiency.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

We have built in a weekly ENL meeting time for teachers to analyze and plan how to use the results from summative data. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Most of our students took the NYSITELL (previously known as the LAB-R) in elementary school and have since progressed in 
their English skills. We have an average of 20 students who are taking the NYSITELL as new enrollees. The majority of them are 
found eligible (scoring below 40%) and entering across all four modalities. According to their Spanish LAB results, many display 
weakness in reading and writing in their native language so the ENL teachers are helping develop English skills through a 
balanced literacy program while content area teachers provide Native Language supports.  According to the data we received 
for the 2015 NYSESLAT, our students fall into the following ranges: Entering - 31 students, Emerging - 13 students, 
Transitioning - 9 students, Expanding - 21 students, and Commanding - 6 students. We are currently using the yearly 
NYSESLAT results to determine the effectiveness of our Pull Out and Push In Services. After reviewing last year's data, we 
determined that students who were Entering and Emerging weren't progressing through the levels quickly enough. Therefore, 
we have implemented a specific Language Acquisition Curriculum which we hope will provide the explicit English instruction 
needed. We will use the 2016 NYSESLAT results to determine the effectiveness of the program (Recipe for Reading) which was 
implemented in February of the 2017 school year.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The ENL coordinator is part of the school's Instructional Cabinet which meets weekly.  The ENL coordinator will disseminate 
findings to the Instructional Cabinet.  The Instructional Cabinet will oversee all curriculum adjustments.

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

I.S. 123 is a vibrant learning community serving 6th, 7th and 8th grade students. The academy offers the unique 
perspective of the American experience weaved through all subject areas but aligned and supported by NYS learning 
standards. Our Freestanding ENL program follows a comprehensive approach to language learning. The curriculum is 
aligned with the NYS learning standards in ENL, and Common Core standards in English and 
NYS standards in the other subject areas. We offer differentiated levels of ENL classes to meet the needs of Entering, 
Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding, and Commanding ELLs. Students are grouped both homogeneously and 
heterogenously, depending on how many ELLs are in each grade level and the availability of classes.  Depending on 
their NYSESLAT results, students receive either integrated ELA services, stand-alone services, or a combination of 
both. Various software programs have been made available to students not only in English but in Spanish as well. The 
ENL teacher works with the target population to enhance their understanding of reading passages and to assist in the 
development of written language conventions. 
  
Our school is set up with Grade teams in a departmentalized model. Time is set up for each grade team and 
department to meet weekly. We also have core members from City Year working in our classrooms with ELLs to 
provide additional support as they are able to work with a small group of students or individual students 
during class.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Part V: ELL Programming Based on the students English proficiency scores from the NYSITELL or NYSESLAT, students are 
provided with mandated units of ENL instruction in either a standalone block for Entering (360 minute) and Emerging (360 
minutes), Transitioning and Expanding 180 minutes, Commanding 90 minutes. Ms. Perch and Mr. Powell will use NYSESLAT 
scores (if not available then NYSITELL) to determine student mandates and construct their schedule to provide mandated ENL 
support across content areas.    
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   In the grades 6-8, the ENL teacher works with students in providing scaffolding, re-teaching, and embedding of vocabulary. 
These activities encompass all four language modalities. The ENL teacher works with students in the area of Readers and 
Writers Workshop, providing intense vocabulary development and scaffolding of tasks, modeling and paying attention to 
writing mechanics. Although all four modalities are addressed, the emphasis for these groups is in the writing modality. In 
Science and Social Studies, teachers are provided with rich libraries that are differentiated for various reading levels. Teachers 
use collaborative learning techniques to pair students who need language support with peers who can assist the ELLs. 
Teachers also use translation software to assist students who are beginners so they can access the content while developing 
their English language skills. We disaggragate all our data and spend a lot of time reviewing how our ELLs are progressing 
throughout the school year as well as holding data chats with the ENL teachers. During these chats, ENL teachers are expected 
to provide evidence of ELL students showing progress in reading (through running records), writing (through Writer's 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          80 

 

Notebooks and published work), listening and speaking (videos), etc. 
All Spanish speaking ELLs initially receive the Spanish LAB which allows us to understand their proficiency level in Spanish. 
Additionally, the administration and ENL teachers will look for appropriate native language assessments to assess reading and 
writing. Doing so, will allow us to determine if a student is weak or strong in any particular modality. 
ELL Students with IEPs follow the same continuum of services as do their non-ENL counterparts. Students in general education 
also receive SETSS. These students are seen by our ENL teachers in accordance with the minimum number of minutes per their 
proficiency levels.  
Our ENL teachers use Readers and Writers Notebooks for all their students to monitor their responses to reading and their 
growth in writing. 
Our newcomers are not excluded from any predictive testing and the teacher receives item skill based data to review and align 
instruction to help prepare students for the eventuality of taking the NYS ELA.  
ELLs receiving 4-6 years of ESL if applicable receive an extention of services if they are not making progress because of their 
status as a SWD, difficulties in Reading, Writing or if they are at-risk and requiring intensive interventions. 
All of our scheduling is done to be as least restrictive as possible for all of our student populations. Our free standing ENL 
students spend their core classes with each other. Each class with ELLs have various levels of English language proficiency.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

  We use the Spanish-Lab Assessment to determine student ability in their Native Language, however, our program is a Free-
Standing ENL Program and we do not teach students in their Native Language. We do provide translation support so that 
students have access to the learning and understanding when they are Entering and Emerging ELLs. Therefore, we do not track 
the improvement of their Native Language as that is not an area that is emphasized in our instruction and curriculum. 
However, if we change our services to include a TBE program, we will then plan to implement both a Native Language 
instructional period and will plan to track improvement of their Native Language.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

  
In the grades 6-8, the ENL teacher and content teacher works with students in providing scaffolding, re-teaching, and 
embedding of vocabulary. These activities encompass all four language modalities. The ENL teacher works with students in the 
area of Readers and Writers Workshop, providing intense vocabulary development and scaffolding of tasks, modeling and 
paying attention to writing mechanics. Although all four modalities are addressed, the emphasis for these groups is in the 
writing modality. In Science and Social Studies, teachers are provided with rich libraries that are differentiated for various 
reading levels. Teachers use collaborative learning techniques to pair students who need language support with peers who can 
assist the ELLs. Teachers also use translation software to assist students who are beginners so they can access the content 
while developing their English language skills. We disaggragate all our data and spend a lot of time reviewing how our ELLs are 
progressing throughout the school year as well as holding data chats with the ENL teachers and the administration. During 
these chats, ENL teachers are expected to provide evidence of ELL students showing progress in reading (through running 
records), writing (through Writer's Notebooks and published work), listening and speaking (videos), etc.  
All Spanish speaking ELL's initially receive the Spanish LAB which allows us to understand their proficiency level in Spanish. 
Since it is initially handscored we determine if a student is weak or strong in any particular modality. Administration and ENL 
teachers will look for appropriate native language assessment to use. The English Language Arts teacher uses formative 
assessments during instruction to provide students with feedback to improve comprehension and writing skills throughout the 
school year. 
Most of our SIFE students do not have IEPs. These students lack proficiency in their native language, Spanish. 
ELL Students with IEPs follow the same continuum of services as do their non-ENL counterparts. Students in general education 
also receive SETSS. These students are seen by our ENL teachers in accordance to the minimum number of minutes per their 
proficiency levels.  

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          81 

 

Our ENL teachers use Recipe for Reading (for Entering and Emerging ELL's) and Readers and Writers Notebooks for all their 
students to monitor their responses to reading and their growth in writing. 
Our newcomers are given a variety of differentiated materials to assist them with language acquisition, transitioning to a new 
system and acquire strong comprehension skills. Our newcomers receive language support through the use of the Recipe for 
Reading Curriculum and the use of Rosetta Stone (web-based program).  
ELLs receiving 4-6 years of ESL, receive an extention of services (during Period 9) if they are not making progress because of 
their status as a SWD, difficulties in Reading, Writing or if they are at-risk and requiring intensive interventions. 
Long-Term ELLs receive NYSESLAT test prep and data proves that the main weakness is in reading and writing so the ENL 
teachers and other content teachers use this information to plan accordingly. 
Once a student attains proficiency on the NYSESLAT, they are considered a Former ELL. Our Former ELLs receive support from 
the ENL teachers. The ENL teachers use the RMSR report from ATS to identify Former ELLs who are in the transitional stage. 
They reach out to these students and their teachers to access what areas still require remediation and instruction. They are 
given discontinuation letters to explain to parents that they are no longer entitled (or mandated) for ENL but that we will 
continue to support their needs. We meet with teachers to determine their needs and allow them to receive test 
accommodations for an additional two years. Our ENL teachers also monitor their progress.  
All of our scheduling is done to be as least restrictive as possible for all of our student populations. Our free standing ENL 
students spend all of the day with their peers in heterogeneous classes.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
In addition to using the Teachers' College curriculum for ELA and in Math, teachers use a variety of strategies such as: 
differentiation of materials, scaffolding and modeling. Teachers use visual supports and teach students about cognates, as well 
as idioms  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
We are in the process of altering our schedule however, we have many ELL-SWDs in the least restrictive environment and thus 
are able to provide ENL and SETSS support. We also have counselors and teachers who are bilingual and can conduct additional 
assessments to determine what the least restrictive environment for ELL-SWDs.  In our school, we have a variety of classes in 
which we can place our ELL-SWDs.  For example, they may be placed in a general education classroom, an ICT class, or a self-
contained class.  At all times, the ENL teachers align ENL instruction with students' IEP goals.  Criteria used to place ELL-SWDs 
in ICT or self-contained classes is dependent on students' IEPs.  If the IEP indicates that students must be in an ICT or self-
contained class, the ENL teachers ensure that those students still receive their services.      
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
For 2017-2018, all students, including ELLs, will receive 10 periods of instruction in ELA and 10 in math a week. During the 
increased ELA block, there are additional supports which include Book Clubs led by City Year core members in a 4 to 1 student 
ratio. In addition, they are invited to attend after-school academic programs and Saturday programs. ENL teachers also have 
City Year Core members who are recent college graduates and can provide intervention in class. ENL teachers also have 5 
periods a week to work with ELLs and non-ENL licensed teachers of ELLs. Our ELLs also receive additional support during the 
school day and after school.  The Academic Intervention Services offers services to all our students who are at risk. These 
students are served by a teacher skilled in providing support in ELA and Math and all the computers are also stocked with 
programs to help build skills in ELA and Math. We plan to use our Extended Learning Time to provide additional instruction for 
all students in the ENL program, the special education students, and those at-risk of not meeting State standards. Math 
interventions are offered during the school day as well as after school and on Saturdays in English and Spanish. Science 
interventions – We are an Urban Advantage and offer students trips to museums to make science come to life. Social studies 
interventions are provided by the Social Studies content teachers but the ENL and ELA teachers plan interdisciplinary units to 
expose students to non-fiction.  Title III funds will also be utilized to provide intensive small group instruction, including 
instruction in the students' native language, which will occur after the regular school day.

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We will review the 2016 NYSESLAT Results to determine if we will continue with the Recipe for Reading Curriculum for all 
Entering and Emerging ENL students.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We do not have a bilingual program and did not have one last year. We hope to open one in the near future. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
We seek to be inclusive to all students regardless of their language status. We want to see all students succeed and attempt to 
put in place all we can to support our students. We strive to be a place in the community that is warm and welcoming. To that 
end, we posted signs in several languages and have staff that can assist with some of the higher incidence languages (Spanish, 
Haitian, French, Arabic, etc). We hold Open House events and send out notices, as well as calls, in English and Spanish. We 
make it clear to all students, including ELLs, what is expected from them and what services are available to them. ELLs are 
included in all parts of school programs and activities. We are also using Title III funds for culturally relevant trips for our ELLs 
and immigrant population. In addition, we offer Title III after-school and/or Saturday programming for ELL students to provide 
them with additional direct instruction. Title III funds are used for our ELLs with 1-5 years of ENL (including those with 
extensions of services) and Title I for our Long-Term ELLs. Teachers can provide after school programming or instruction on 
Saturdays.  ELLs are invited to attend after-school with our program partner, City Year/SONYC which offers Homework Help, a 
variety of clubs, and sports related activities.   
In addition to City Year's after-school program, all students, including ELLs, participate in Extended Learning Time (ELT), which 
affords teachers the opportunity to provide students with additional literacy support.  ELT is an additional hour and 15 
minutes of daily support that begins immediately after the regular school day., Tuesday through Fridays.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
ELLs are supported in the core content areas through a variety of instructional materials such as native language materials (i.e. 
Spanish mentor texts for Spanish speakers) and access to technology such as Google Translate. They also use Rosetta Stone 
and will be using Imagine Learning in the 2018 school year. They also receive scaffolded instruction in order for them to access 
the Writing Curriculum.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

We also provide Native Language Materials for the content areas such as textbooks for Social Studies in English and Spanish. 
We also order native language novels, texts and books for students. Classrooms also have bilingual dictionaries.  In addition to 
providing ENL classes, we make every attempt to hire bilingual speaking math teachers to support ENL students. Native 
language support for beginner ENL students is given by City Year Core members in all content classes except for ENL. Our Social 
Studies and Science teachers collaborate with our ENL teachers to design strategies or differentiated instruction for our ELLs.    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

We offer a variety of resources that correspond to the varying age levels of our ELLs. We also buy books that support our 
leveled libraries and look for novels that are high interest and low readability. All classrooms are technology rich and all core 
subject rooms contain projectors, Smart boards, laptops and classroom desktop computers. All students have access to web-
based technologies such as I-Ready, Rosetta Stone, Study Island, School Net and Performance Series.     
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our ELL Coordinator works with the ELL Coordinator of MS 337. We will share resources and space in order to provide the 
services necessary for our ENL students.

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We make several efforts in order to assist newly enrolled ELL students before the beginning of the school year. In July, we 
reach out to parents of our incoming 6th grade class using Blackboard Connect (a web-based calling service) sending out 
messages in English and Spanish to invite them to see the school in August. In August we provide a new school year 
orientation. At that event, we have rooms set up to speak to parents in English or Spanish about what they can expect for 
September. In addition, every student is given a workbook in English (with directions in Spanish for students and parents to 
understand) which gives them a preview of the academic content of their next grade. Parents of newly enrolled ELL students 
are given our Parent/Student manual with our Parent Coordinator contact information. Our school is open throughout the 
summer and we always have our Parent Coordinator and other bilingual staff members on hand to answer questions about 
registration and school rules, procedures, dress codes, etc. Welcome letters are sent home to students in English and Spanish 
along with contact information and our website address so that parents have a variety of ways to access information from the 
school.     
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Language electives are not offered at this time but will be considered for the 2018-2019 school-year. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A   
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Teachers of ELLs (Ms. Perch and Mr. Powell) will attend professional development provided in school as well as outside the 
school on a monthly basis. Teachers of ELLs will attend Professional development provided by the NYC ELL department and our 
current Borough Office. All other clusters teachers of ELLs will also attend Professional development provided in house and by 
the Department Of Education ELL department. Such professional development will include utilizing ESL strategies in Math, 
Reading in all content areas, incorporating the Common Core language standards when planning, and scaffolding effective 
lessons using ESL strategies. Teachers will also attend a series of workshops that will focus on discussions and questioning 
techniques in all subject areas aligned to Common Core Language Standards provided by administration, the school, and the 
network team. Throughout the school year, we work to provide the mandated 50% of ELL PDs for ENL providers and 15% of 
ELL Pd for all other staff members. Teachers attend ELL pds provided by certified ESL in house staff, and attend 
network/central office of ELLs Professional development.  Professional development opportunities for all staff include a 
combination of in-house and contracted services targeting instructional practices and methodologies designed to meet the 
needs of the ELL students. For example, Teach Like a Champion Strategies (September), ESL Strategies (February), Curriculum 
Mapping to include ESL Strategies and monthly weekly Professional Development PLC meetings (ongoing).  
PD topics include multidisciplinary approaches, thematic units, understanding the Language Progressions, Introducing Recipe 
for Reading, and differentiated instruction in the ESL classroom. Math teachers have attended PD from Generation Ready that 
targets needs of ELLs and strategies which they turnkey to their team. ENL teachers have received support on incorporating 
ELL supports in the Balanced Literacy Workshop model.    
All teachers of literacy, including ENL have received training on the balanced literacy model and collaborate on resources in 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          84 

 

 

planning sessions. ENL teachers also receive support from the administration to discuss the specific needs of ELLs and to order 
specific materials/books/native language supports for their students. In addition, ENL teachers attend Professional Learning 
sessions offered by the district, as well as the NYC DOE, several times throughout the year.  This information is then turn-keyed 
to the rest of the staff so they can best support ELLs' learning as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards.   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The ENL teachers are involved in planning with fellow department and grade members. In addition, the principal, Mr. Richard 
Hallenbeck, will send other staff members, such as guidance counselors, to professional learning sessions offered by the NYC 
DOE, as they become available, so they may assist ELLs as they transition.   
We offer the training throughout various key points in the year to ensure that the importance of serving ELLs is never 
forgotten. The training is split during both Professional Development Staff days (November and June) and weaved in 
throughout our weekly Monday Professional development sessions so that all staff (Assistant Principal, ENL coordinators, 
common branches teachers, subject area teachers, paraprofessionals, ENL teachers, guidance counselors, special education 
teachers, psychologists, speech therapists, secretaries, parent coordinators) receive this required training. We will continue to 
contract with Generation Ready as well as any PD in P-Weekly to offer specific training for our administration, school secretary 
and guidance staff on the intake of ELL eligible students, issues concerning ELLs, promotion criteria of ELLs, etc. All 
documentation of training (agendas, attendance sheets) is maintained by the Principal in the Main Office.    
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
For 2017-2018, the new UFT contract allows for specific Parent Outreach events and meetings on a weekly basis. ENL teachers 
will continue to use that time to conduct parent outreach to parents of ELLs to discuss goals. These individual one-to-one 
meetings will be documented by the ENL teachers using sign-in sheets and note-taking forms to document the conversations 
had with parents around students and their goals. As we have several Spanish speaking staff available for translation. Teachers 
have also been provided with the helpline number that also provides translation services for most languages.     

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

We have been working to improve parent involvement and participation across the board. We have two bilingual family 
workers who constantly reach out to parents by phone or in person by conducting home visits. We constantly have parents in 
the school for a variety of reasons and work to meet their needs. We hold an annual Parent Orientation and then continue 
individual orientations as students register throughout the school year. Parents/guardians frequently come in for school 
letters, to visit the Parent Coordinator, use the Parent Resource Center, to visit attendance, to meet with teachers or to meet 
with the Assistant Principals, Deans, Special Education Supervisor, School Psychologist, Social Workers and other support staff 
who are also bilingual. We also use an automated phone messaging service to send out important messages or reminders in 
English and Spanish.  
We consistently encourage the parents of our ELLs to attend meetings with their children's teachers, especially on Tuesdays 
during Parent Engagement time, when they are able to meet with all of their children's teachers simultaneously to receive 
current information regarding their children's academic and language acquisition progress.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, RICHARD HALLENBECK JR, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities 
are adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

We also distribute the Preferred Language Form to each family and check it against the ATS Home Language 
indicator. We run reports on ATS regarding the Home Language to use when distributing paperwork to parents. 
The data used to access our school’s written translation and oral interpretation needs include data found from a 
variety of sources. The parent surveys and parent selection forms gathered from student permanent records and 
from those filled out by parents when students entering the NYC schools for the first time. We also utilize 
information gathered from Part III of the Home Language Survey (HLIS), ATS reports, Student Emergency Contact 
cards, Language Allocation Policy, the School Parent Compact, and the School Parent Involvement Policy. We met 
with parents at Open House and the New School Year Orientation. We also did an assessment of our HILS and are 
inviting parents to several ELL Orientations. The policy of J.H.S. 123 is to provide all parents with written 
translation and oral interpretations through all means available to us.

How does your school plan to provide 

interpretation service(s)?  

We higher translators to help with 
communication between staff and 
parents. In addition, our bilingual 
teachers and guidance counselors 
assist in translations as well.  

 

Furthermore, we have numerous staff 
(school aides, family assistants, our 
Parent Coordinator and all guidance 
and social work staff) who reach out to 
parents on a daily basis.  

 

Many of our staff are available to 
provide translations in Spanish.  

For the weekly parent meetings, 
teachers will use the NYC DOE 
translation services provided by the 
DOE via the phone. 

Translation is provided to parents by 
the Parent Coordinator at these 
meetings when necessary.

Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

We will provide this information to all staff members at our first Monday Professional Development Session in 
September. We will coordinate with the Translation Unit to provide the necessary training to our Parent Coordinator 
and staff members that provide the Translation Services to our parents. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

At our annual School Orientation in August, parents are informed that all information is provided to them in both their 
preferred language as well as English. We provide this information at our workshops via verbal translations, our 
letters and fliers that are distributed at the orientation and prior to the orientation.  
 
As noted above, translation services are available daily in Spanish. All communications are sent out in Spanish and 
English to our families, together with the announcement given in several languages provided by the Chancellor’s 
Office on where to go to get materials translated into a language other than Spanish. We also use DOE websites 
(intranet and http://dfoforms.nycenet.edu/forms/) to access forms in Spanish and other home languages. 
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

The Parent Coordinator will survey parents during parent conferences (September, November, February and May) to 
gather feedback as well as to hear their concerns or receive suggestions. In addition, we will schedule a focus group of 
parents inclusive of all cultures and languages represented in our school to gather feedback and best practices on 
ways to improve communication and availability of translation services. The feedback provided will be used to inform 
future Language Interpretation and Translation Plans as well as our future Student/Parent School Orientations.
