Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

Our mission statement is: We believe that students learn best when learning is active in an environment where 
students feel safe and respected. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Learners and Leaders is located in Ridgewood, Queens. We are a Title 1 school with a diverse population; 
approximately 80% Hispanic, 12% White and 5% Asian. From September 2008 - June 2015, we were an Early 
Childhood Center, serving grades Prek-3.  

In September 2018 we will begin our third year serving grades Prek through 5. We have been working on ensuring 
coherence throughout the school. We are determined to support our students in performing at high levels in all 
content areas. We used the common core aligned programs, Ready Gen for reading, Schoolwide for writing and Go 
Math to support teaching and learning in math. In previous years, our instructional focus; Developing Students’ 
Language and Vocabulary skills. helped deepen our understanding of many aspects of teaching and learning especially 
around planning, instruction and assessment. The work we did in this area has helped us integrate the demands 
embedded within the Framework for Teaching evaluation system and the Common Core Learning Standards.  

Our CEP goals are geared toward improving student performance. Each year our goals are designed to deepen the 
work begun the previous year. We focus on incorporating our deepening understanding of strong pedagogy aligned 
with Components 3b (questioning and discussion), 3c (student engagement, and 3c (assessment for instruction) in the 
Danielson Framework. In analyzing our needs for the coming year we recognize and celebrate the progress we've 
made in pedagogy and student performance. We will build upon and expand our work. We will use our commitment 
to coherence throughout the school to improve teacher practice, student performance and partnerships with parents. 
These goals are designed to enrich our community socially, emotionally and academically.  

 

In 2017-18, we shifted the school's Instructional Focus from Vocabulary and language development to supporting 
student autonomy through meaningful student-led talk in the classroom. In the coming year the administration will 
continue to work with teachers, including ESL and special education teacher teams. In addition, grade level teacher 
teams will be supported in establishing and communicating clear expectations for student led talk, and collecting and 
analyzing data to inform planning and instruction. 

 

We have been focusing on using criteria in a variety of contexts related to academic performance and social and 
emotional support. In analyzing student work from a variety of sources, including teacher observation, Advance 
observation data, unit and chapter tests and observing student talk, we realize that we need to shift our Instructional 
Focus on the broad use of data. Teachers will use data from a variety of sources to assess student performance and 
differentiate instruction for groups of students. This will allow teachers to zoom in on analyzing and using data from 
many sources in addition to continuing and deepening our focus on student talk. Last year we purchased and began 
exploring Mastery Connect. We will use the program to support us in using data in a variety of ways to differentiate 
instruction and more effectively meet students' learning needs.  

 

In 2018-19 we will use our instructional focus to support our work as we continue to focus on the questions below to 
guide our thinking: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

1) what criteria should we use to help us determine whether learners are meeting performance expectations?  

2) what models of exemplary work can we provide;  

3) how can we use a learner-centered approach to ensure learners are aware of performance expectations and 
criteria;  

4) what specific and actionable feedback can we provide;  

5) what differentiated tools and scaffolds will support understanding and mastery of content; 

6) how can we track progress and performance;  

7) how can we design learning activities in ways that will provide evidence of learning;  

8) how can assessment during learning guide planning and instruction.  

 

We have begun to see the major shift that is represented by the way these questions are phrased. The focus is on the 
learner (who can be teacher, parent or student) as opposed to only the student. We are using this perspective to 
solidify our status as a community of lifelong learners. We are establishing a road map to support learning, ensure 
coherence, and measure progress of all members of the school community. We will deepen our exploration and 
understanding of Questions 1, 2 and 3, and also focus on Questions 4, 5, and 6. . As a school that has recently 
expanded, we will continue to address the challenges to ensure cohesiveness across the school. 

 

 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Special student populations we serve include: 

- Newcomer immigrant students who need intensive support in learning both social and academic English. 

English as a New Language learners who are performing at an Entering level are provided with instruction throughout 
the week by licensed teachers to deepen their understanding and use of academic vocabulary.  

ESL teachers use a combined push-in, pull-out model to support students at the Entering and Emerging levels. 

Certified ESL teachers use the push-in model to support ENLs at the Emerging, Transitioning and Expanding levels. 
When possible, students performing at these levels are placed with classroom teachers who possess ESL certification. 
Certified ESL teachers are assigned to work with these classes to provide additional support to targeted ENL students.  

In 2016-2017, 54 out of 154 ENLs scored at the Commanding level. Former English Language Learners (F-ELLs) who 
have demonstrated proficiency in English at their grade level are provided with continued support two periods per 
week of support provided by a teacher who has ESL certification. 

Students with Disabilities require a wide variety of services depending on specific needs. These services are 
determined by each student's Individualized Education Plan (IEP.) We provide a range of services in order to ensure 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

students succeed academically, socially and emotionally. Mandated services provided for students in 2017-2018 
include: 

Speech and Language support 

Occupational Therapy 

Physical Therapy 

Counseling (RSA basis) Currently we do not have a counselor on staff 

ICT classes consisting of 60% general education students/40% students with IEPs. These classes are served by 2 
teachers. One teacher is certified as a general education teacher and is an expert on grade level curriculum. The 
second teacher is a certified special education teacher. The special education teacher is trained in adapting and 
modifying grade level curriculum to meet the needs of students with IEPs. 

Self-contained classes are smaller classes, usually limited to no more than 12 students. Self-contained classes are 
taught by certified special education teachers who are expected to adapt and modify curriculum to meet the learning 
needs of their students. In 2016-217 our self contained classes in K through Grade 6 adopted Collaborative 
Classrooms, an ELA program designed to support struggling learners. As we did in 2017-18, we will continue to 
support teachers and students in using the program to effectively support accelerated progress for our student in self-
contained classes.  

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

In 2017-18 our Instructional Focus was supporting student autonomy through meaningful student-led talk in the 
classroom. Advance data (teacher evaluation scores on Component 3b on the Danielson rubric,) and observations 
from learning walks provide strong evidence of improvement in this area. Teachers' scores in Component 3b - 
Questioning and discussion improved from 2016-17 to 2017-18. In 2016-17 teachers' scores in 3b were 10% Highly 
Effective, 75% Effective, 13% Developing and 2% Ineffective. In 2017-2018 twice as many teachers, or 20% received 
Highly Effective ratings in 3b, while 69% scored Effective, and 13% scored in the developing range. Teachers' practice 
showed significant gains across the school.

Supporting teacher planning – in the 2017-18 school year we worked to support teacher collaboration by: 

1) Administration scheduled time for collaborative planning to allow teachers to plan units together in reading, 
writing, math, social studies and science. Teachers in Grades Prek-3 planned with grade level colleagues. Teachers in 
Grades 4 and 5 are departmentalized. Therefore they planned with colleagues on and across the grades. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12 

 

2) In an effort to enhance cohesion, two school-wide academic practices were introduced. Based on data from 3rd 
and 4th grade inquiry work, teachers decided to introduce the acronym RACER, which is used to support writing 
across grades. Teachers in Grades K-5 worked together to share practice and determine how to teach RACER in a 
developmentally appropriate sequence that would ensure students used the acronym across grades RACER, and were 
ready to build upon their knowledge and skills as they were promoted.  

3) Through feedback during observations teachers were encouraged to visit each other and to share practice. Several 
teachers who received overall MOTP evaluation of Highly Effective and Effective agreed to open their classrooms to 
colleagues, and debrief after. Thus have we begun a culture of inter-visitation and collaboration that we wan to build 
upon this year.  

 

In 2018-2019 we would like to deepen teacher collaboration. Our goal is to support teachers in working together to 
identify challenges, locate and review resources, and apply their collective learning to improve practice throughout 
the school. We will achieve this in 3 ways: 

1) Teachers will use data on student work and performance to engage in a minimum of two rounds of inquiry in the 
2017-18 school year. We expect this engagement to provide the necessary learning to an increased number of 
meaningful and productive cycles in subsequent years.  

2) Teachers who were rated Effective and Highly Effective will be encouraged to choose Advance option which include 
inter-visitations from colleagues. We want to build on and increase inter-visitations, which began in 2017-2018. 

3) Our Professional Learning Team will develop a schedule for professional learning cycles, and provide a list of 
resources and guidance for groups of teachers to use to work together to enhance practice collaboratively. These 
cycles may consist of outside providers or a collaoborative study of professional references or texts by groups of 
teachers.  

Our ultimate goal is to positively impact student thinking and performance.  

 

Trust is taking an increasingly important role in our school community. Our community has expanded and all 
members, including students, parents, teachers, and support staff are expected to work together to achieve success. 
This requires skill in working in teams, and strong trust between people. In the 2017-18 School Survey, teachers and 
paraprofessionals reported significantly lower levels of trust in the administration than in previous years. 
Administration will take steps to restore trust.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Data from teacher observation reports, our 2015 Quality Review, the Principal Performance Review for 2017-18, 
student work, unit and standardized tests, and the work of teacher teams indicates that throughout the school 
instruction is generally customized, aligned to the Common Core. This evidence is based on our work with curriculum 
programs that are aligned with the Common Core standards in reading, writing and math. This has led to exposing 
students to more complex text and engagement at higher levels. Work is customized, especially for English Language 
Learners and Students with Disabilities to some extent throughout the school. 

In 2016-17 we focused on strengthening planning and instruction in order to help students understand the 
relationship between concepts to deepen their learning. In observations and feedback to teachers administration 
highlighted the importance of recognizing by focusing on the following areas. 

Planning for high level student-centered learning activities. (1a 1e, 3b, 3c) 

Identifying the important concepts in a topic and how they are related (1a) 

Recognizing prerequisite skills necessary for learning (1a) 

Utilizing a variety of pedagogical approaches (1a) 

Planning learning activities designed to engage students cognitively and intellectually (1e) 

Using appropriate materials and resources to support students' learning (1e) 

Effectively organize and plan for instructional groups to support student learning (1e) 

Organize and sequence units and lessons to advance student learning (1e) 

Incorporating data from our analysis of student work into subsequent planning and instruction (1e) 

 

In establishing goals for 2017-18, analysis of teacher observation data indicated that teachers across the school 
recognize the important concepts within units. For the 2016/17 school year teachers focused on helping students 
understand the relationship between concepts to deepen their learning. In order to be successful teachers need to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15 

 

recognize the prerequisite skills students have and need to master concepts and content and to provide targeted 
support for grouping students.  

 

For 2018-19 we are narrowing our focus to students with disabilities. Analysis of teaching experience in ICT and self-
contained classroom revealed that six of our 14 special education teachers were not tenured. Additionally while 
students with disabilities are showing improvement across the school, many have not caught up to their typically 
developing peers. We recognize and believe that the right setting is critical to ensuring student success. It is also 
critically important to support special education teachers so they can provide the the highest level of education.  

 

Typically ICT teachers plan with their general education partners and provide at least one scaffold for students for 
each lesson. Self-contained classes use specialized ELA programs published by Collaborative Classrooms in reading, 
writing and word work to support our students with disabilities. They use the Go Math program which is also used by 
general education classes. Administration will support special education self-contained and ICT teachers in 
researching and identifying effective scaffolds designed to accelerate improvements in student performance.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019 teacher ratings for 50% of ICT and self-contained teacher evaluations will show improvement in teacher 
practice in Component 3d - Assessment for Instruction of the Danielson Framework for Teaching, which will lead to an 
increase in scaffolds provided for groups of students.

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
Although families often recognize and appreciate student progress in special education settings, they also express 
frustration that progress is often slow. Students often remain in special education settings. Oct 2018-Jan 2019 SLT 
members will work with teacher teams and parents to understand challenges and areas for growth. The team will 
work with teachers, parents and administration to develop effective ways to support families in understanding 
requirements for mastery, and the scaffolds that are used to support their children.  

ICT and self-contained teachers will contact the parent of students with disabilities at least twice during the year (in 
addition to citywide parent-teacher conferences) during Tuesday Parent Engagement time to help parents' 
understand students' needs and scaffolds and supports they are using to support progress.

human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
In order to support professional development and teacher team work the following resources will be allocated – 

Monday afternoon professional development time will be allocated for teachers to work together to analyze student 
data, determine areas of weakness and identify scaffolds and supports for groups of students.  

The administration will work with the Professional Development team to develop tools to support teacher 
understanding and implementation of Effective and Highly Effective practices to analyze data, identify resources, 
implement scaffolds and interventions, measure their effectiveness and revise (intensify or reduce) as needed.  

The Professional Development will embed critical and relevant connections between the teacher team work on 
student work and the Danielson Framework, the Quality Review rubric and the Principal Performance rubric. 

Calendar and additional planning days will be allocated to provide teacher teams with time to work in vertical teams 
to align planning and practice across the school. 

 

Administration, teacher teams and individual teachers will identify connections between improvements in planning 
and impact on instruction (measured by teacher observations) and student performance (measured by student work 
and performance on assessments.)

By February 2018 administration will have completed one cycle of analyzing ELA or math data and developed 
additional scaffolds to support student progress. The SLT will review ratings in Component 3d as well as student 
performance data and supervisor comments on teacher observations to assess progress towards meeting the goal.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
In 2015-16 we conducted a review of the school's needs based on data sources including anecdotal data from 
teachers and students' report cards, as well as occurrence reports submitted to OORS. revealed that we have students 
on every grade with moderate to severe needs in adjusting to the expectations for appropriate self-control and 
behavior in school. This results in frustration and poor self-esteem for students, and lost instructional time for 
teachers and classmates. In order to support all members of the school community we decided to focus on school-
wide strategies for supporting students with challenging behaviors. Our goal is to to ensure that the school’s approach 
to social-emotional support for our students is informed by a theory of action and results in a safe environment and 
inclusive culture that reduces the barriers to educational success. In the 2016-17 school year our paraprofessionals 
began studying and implementing the strategies of Lost at School. By June 2017 paraprofessionals began creating tool 
kits to provide social emotional-support for our students. Member of the paraprofessional study group conducted 
two presentations to school staff. Although a general description and rational for the work was provided to the 
teachers, much more work is needed to expand the work to positively impact as many students as we can. Last year, 
paraprofessionals reported that the Lost at School work they had done did not provide enough concrete and specific 
interventions. They did not feel ready to turnkey their learning and continued to work on learning how to provide 
social-Tsupport for students. Using Monday afternoon professional learning time paraprofessionals researched the 
Collaborative Problem Solving strategy. They utilized professional learning time in February, March, April and May to 
create an online toolkit to provide support in the classroom.  

In 2017-18 teachers formed a Character Education team in to establish clear expectations for appropriate behaviors. 
Based on a survey of staff concerns the team identified kindness and responsibility as the areas that would have the 
greatest impact on the school climate. The team selected texts for classes to read, and created a system for teachers 
and students to report acts of kindness. These acts were celebrated during morning announcements, and in small 
displays throughout the school.  

This year teachers expressed frustration with students who exhibit ongoing disruptive and disrespectful behaviors. 
Staff requested clear procedures from administration for dealing with inappropriate behaviors such as ongoing 
aggression, rule-breaking, disruptions, and disrespect. In June 2018 teachers formed a behavior team to clarify 
expectations and procedures for inappropriate behaviors. In 2018-19 the team will base their work on two 
commitments: 1) we will continue to use the STARS program already in place in the school. The team will promote 
increased awareness and understanding of the values and expectations of the STARS program. The second 
commitment is for administration and staff to emphasize teaching alternative behaviors as an alternative to 
consequences and punishment.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          21 

 

identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 5 classroom teachers who work directly with paraprofessionals will be participating in or monitoring the 
utilization of strategies from Collaborative Problem Solving with targeted students.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Teacher collaboration characterizes many aspects of the work we do at our school. Since we opened in September 
2008, teachers have worked together on planning and instruction, addressed challenges together and worked hard to 
support each other. Our entire school culture is characterized by respect, support and continuous improvement.  

Analyzing students' scores in the 2017 NYS ELA exam as well as teacher responses to the needs assessments across 
the school, it was evident that student led discussions with higher order thinking questions would be an area that 
could improve academic achievement in the school. 

We have been using the Ready Gen reading program, and School-wide writing program along with additional support 
from Learning A-Z, the Fontas and Pinnell Guided Reading Continuum to support our work. This year we realized that 
teachers want and need additional support in providing differentiated small group and independent work for 
students. In the 2018-19 teachers in K-5 will be working with consultant from the Teachers College Reading and 
Writing Project to provide structured and strategic whole class and small group instruction in reading and writing.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Our goals for 2018-19 will consist of supporting and strengthening last year's goals. We will continue to invite 
teachers to use professional learning to strengthen and build their conceptual understanding of math. We will also 
review Go Math on-line resources with parents, and follow up to ensure they are using them, and determine what 
additional supports they are looking for.  

We will also work with teachers teams to clarify expectations for Accountable Talk, which is aligned with 3b and 3c of 
the Danielson rubric. Teacher responses on the School Survey indicated 86% of teachers reported that students 
participate in class discussions at some point. This is consistent with data in Advance from observations where 100% 
of teachers received scores of Highly Effective or Effective in Questioning and Discussion. Responses also indicated 
that only 54% of teachers believe that students build upon each other's ideas during class discussions; and only 46% 
of teachers reported that students use data or text references to support ideas. Accountable Talk is happening 
throughout the school. In alignment with our Instructional Focus we will encourage teacher to develop expectations 
for good student talk behaviors, criteria for measuring talk, tools and procedures for observing and recording student 
discussions, then analyzing the data to make whole and small group plans for strengthening talk.  

We will continue to support teacher teams in effectively using data to support student progress and performance. 
Based on a teacher visit to PS 14 to learn about how they collect and analyze data the school purchased Mastery 
Connect in spring 2018. Teachers were invited to spend the rest of the year exploring the program. Several teachers 
took on leadership roles, and committed to a detailed exploration. In 2018-19 teachers will begin to enter student 
performance data into the Mastery Connnect site. Teachers will work together to analyze and sort the data and use it 
to make critical decisions about whole class and small group instruction.  

Close analysis of the 2018 School Survey points to the need for strong action in three area of Effective School 
Leadership. As a result, the principal will take the following actions: 

- improve communication with staff to ensure transparency and explain actions and decisions. When considering 
changes administration will make every effort to invite the input of teachers, support staff, parents and students. 
Once decisions are made members of the administration will coordinate our efforts to support their implementation. 
Changes must be carefully thought out and fully explained and justified.  

- invite teams of teachers to revisit, adopt and promote the vision the school staff created collaboratively in 2014, and 
use the vision to establish clear expectations for meeting instructional goals. 

- ensure that the principal and two assistant principals to ensure function as a more cohesive unit by changing the 
way we communicate to staff about administrative decisions and actions.

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and

limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

After surveying our parents, we determined that they are looking for support in helping their children with math. The 
parents need support in implementing Common Core mathematics. The school staff has been exploring options to 
meet the needs of the parents. In 2016-2017 we were able to ensure that Go Math videos were available to parent so 
they could support their children at home. In 2017-18 we developed a school-wide commitment to supporting 
parents in accessing and using Go Math videos to support parents in understanding math homework and math 
content.  

This year we realized the need for the staff and parents to build on the many strong relationships that already exist. 
Parent leaders on the PTA and SLT have indicated that they need the help and support of the school staff, as well as 
other parents to both create the warm, supportive school-parent partnership we want, and to develop the manpower 
needed to meet PTA goals for supporting the school. For these reasons we have strengthened the parent component 
connected to every goal on our 2018-19 CEP.  

Several teachers have joined with parents to support their efforts and enhance their relationship with the school. This 
team of parents and teachers has been meeting since June 2018. They are working together to build a strong 
community of parents and teachers. 

 

Based on some statements by parents, administration believes there are cultural divides between many staff 
members and families, which represent very diverse populations. For this reason, we will be introducing the staff to 
concepts and practices embodied in Culturally Responsive Practice. The goal is to help our school staff understand the 
potential difficulties and challenges that often arise because of inadvertently insensitive behaviors toward students 
and parents from unfamiliar and different cultures. At the same time, we will utilize resources to help us bridge 
cultural disconnects and employ culturally responsive practices and behaviors designed to improve elevate student 
achievement and the message that all cultures are respected and celebrated at our school. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and

Based on administrations requests, the P-T team will establish a 
system for communicating with the school community. They will 
use this system to inform the community about the reasons and 
process behind the selection of a lion as the school mascot and 
the role it will play in the life of the school. 

 

Administrators will support the P-T team in developing a two 
year plan to fully integrate the values and traits of the lion 
mascot into the daily life of the school.  

 

 

The P-T team will plan a series of events using the lion mascot to 
excite the school community and bring them to attend. 

 

 

 

 

The P-T will collaborate with members of other teams that are 
focused on supporting school culture and climate, such as the 
STARS Behavior Team, the Character Ed team, Student Council 
and other teams to coordinate efforts and procedures, and 
ensure practices don't contradict each other, and the lion 
mascot is incorporated into the efforts of other teams.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
100% of our teachers are highly qualified. Professional development and teacher teams are structured to ensure that 
practice and pedagogy are based on student outcomes. We are successful in recruiting and retaining highly qualified 
teachers by establishing a positive, supportive culture and climate, as well as providing high levels of differentiated 
professional development to support improvements in practice. Assignments are determined using a variety of 
considerations including teachers’ strengths, experience on certain grades, need to recognize the connections 
between grades and teachers’ choices. As we expand and hire new staff we have focused our recruitment on teachers 
who possess dual certification, either general education and special education or TESOL and special or general 
education. Over 75% of our students are not native speakers of English. We have had success and are continuing to 
work to attract certified ESL teachers. Administration is also encouraging teachers to obtain ESL certification and is 
supporting teachers in trying to create a partnership with a local university to bring an ESL certification program to 
our school. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
For 2017-18 we are continuing our Professional Learning Team model with slight modifications. Teachers on the team 
hold certification in the following areas: general education, special education and TESOL. We also included two new 
teachers on our team to ensure that we include their perspective in meeting the needs of our staff. Our Professional 
Learning Team has developed a balanced approach to structuring and scheduling professional development. A portion 
of Monday afternoon Professional Development time will be allocated weekly for Cycles of Inquiry and for Teacher 
Rounds. Time will also be allocated for grade level teacher teams to analyze student work and identify class and grade 
trends to drive instruction. The team has identified cycles throughout the year that teachers can offer and select 
teacher-led PD in topics of their choice. In addition we will be offering teachers a Teacher Rounds. Teachers will have 
the opportunities to choose an area of focus based on interest. Groups will identify resources, set goals and a 
generate a product. Other supports for High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development will be embedded in the 
partner work that some of the teachers will be participating in.  

In addition administration and Effective and Highly Effective teachers will work with teachers who have demonstrated 
the need for support in specific areas. Administration will also work with Effective and Highly Effective teachers in 
identifying resources options for improving their practice as well as taking on leadership roles within the school. In 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

addition, specific teams such as the ESL teachers and special education teachers will meet on a set schedule every 
other week. These teams will use study the common core standards, performance expectations and student work 
across grades to learn about their students. The teams will reach out to district and other educational supports to 
support our growth. Administrators will work along side teachers to strengthen knowledge and understanding of 
teaching and learning and to support student progress. 

 

 
Part 3: TA Schools Only 

3a. Use of Program Resources 

Describe how the TA program resources will assist participating children to meet proficiency. 
  

 
3b. TA Coordination with the Regular Program 

Describe the planning, coordination and support of the TA program with the regular educational program (i.e., 
providing ELT, accelerated, high-quality curriculum, including applied learning; and minimize removing children from 
the regular classroom during regular school day). 
  

 
 
 
 
 
Part 4: SWP Schools Only 

4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)  

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
In order to support preschool children from early childhood programs into the elementary school program we have 
expanded our pre-K program from a half-day to a full day program. This will enable us to prepare students for our 
nurturing and rigorous CCLS aligned kindergarten and elementary program. We also invite parents with students in 
local day care programs to tour our school and attend a presentation about our academic program. 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
As part of the ADVANCE teacher evaluation system a team of teachers identified assessments that will be 
administered and used to evaluate teachers. Teachers on each grade and content area actively participate in the use 
and selection of a variety of ongoing and formative assessments. Professional development is designed to increase 
teachers’ understanding of the characteristics of effective ongoing assessment through analyzing and exploring 
Component 3D of the Danielson Framework. This year we are supporting that work by focusing on Components 1a 
and 1e of the Danielson Framework. These components emphasize the importance of effective planning to support 
our work with using assessments. Professional development will build on prior work focusing on supporting teachers 
in effectively using data from assessments to plan instruction. We will be looking very closely and carefully at the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

characteristics of effective planning and incorporating them into our unit and lesson planning. Teachers then work 
together to develop and share plans based on Domain 1 of the Danielson Rubric 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP) 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Learners and Leaders, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of 
the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input.  

 

 

Learners and Leaders will support parents and families of Title I students by:

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional

Starting in early October, Learners and Leaders will provide an intervention program targeting 
at-risk ELLs and new comers who need additional grammatical and phonetic support.  Margaret 
Padua (Ms. Maggi, NYS ELL certified instructor) will work with these ELLs on Wednesdays 
and Thursdays for .5 hour sessions. The program duration will be a half-hour since students 
remain in the classroom at the end of the day and thus avoid losing any instructional time by 
transitioning to a new location.  During the hours of 2:30-3:00 p.m., Ms. Maggi will utilize 
Fundations, which is based upon the Wilson Reading System principles and serves as a 
prevention program to help reduce reading and spelling failure.  Each level of Fundations 
presents skills in a carefully structured scope and sequence.  Some of the instructional activities 
of the Wilson-based program are: letter formation, sound mastery, phonics, vocabulary, tricky 
words, fluency, and literary comprehension. Each lesson has been designed for a 30 minute 
duration.  This program will expand in January by incorporating a whole language approach and 
NYSESLAT practice for all ELLs, not just those that are at-risk.Beginning the third week of 
January, our fourteen week after school program is aiming to prepare our students for the 
NYSESLAT and target all of our students' literacy goals in the four modalities. The program will 
begin in January and will be completed in the last week of April prior to NYSESLAT. For the 
first nine weeks of the program, we will be working in small groups using data from student 
work and the previous year's NYSESLAT test scores to guide our instructional goals. We will 
utilize component of Teachers College to provide scaffolded instruction for close reading, oral 
reading, and language analysis.  Teachers College also includes focused writing instruction to 
work on conventions and the writing process. For the remaining five weeks of the program we 
will continue our small group work and begin introducing the NYSESLAT. Students will 
become familiar with the format of the test and the rubrics used to grade their work.  We have 
decided that Kindergarten, 1st, 2nd,3rd  and 4th Grade students will receive instruction on 
Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:30 to 4:00 p.m. for a total of 3 hours per week.  Students will 
be grouped based on their academic needs.  Kindergarten, 1st grade and 3rd grade ENL teachers 
will be servicing a limited number of newcomers.  Small grouping within the classroom will 
ensure teachers are able to differentiate lessons for the newcomers to make input more 
comprehensible to them.  There are no SIFEs in our school at the present time.  Teachers who 
work with our ELLs with disabilities subgroup in grades K-3 will implement recommended IEP 
modifications during all Title III programs.  Since all of our ELL students are in the ENL 
Program, instruction will be given in English.  The approximate number of ELLs (depending on 
participation) for each grade is as follows: Kindergarten: 40 ELLs, 1st grade: 22 ELLs, 2nd 
grade: 13 ELLs, and 3rd grade: 8 ELLs.During the first nine weeks the program will focus 
primarily on non-fiction literature which is emphasized in the Common Core Standards. We have 
also decided to spotlight nonfiction to build background knowledge, vocabulary, and schema for 
ELLs.  The materials we will be using are literature from Teachers College, our leveled libraries, 
videos, poems, songs, Fundations, audiobooks, NYSESLAT Test Prep workbooks and other 
resources and realia that support early literacy development.  There will be seven teachers 
involved in this program and four are ELL licensed. The teachers who are not ELL certified will 
receive training and co-teach with our five NYS ELL certified teachers (Yasmina Keller, Melissa

Branch teachers will focus on the content of instruction while ELL teachers will concentrate on 
the language objectives of each lesson.

   The five NYS ELL- licensed providers (Yasmina Keller, Melissa Marino, Marlene Feliciano,

targeted toward shrinking the performance gap of ELLs.  Some of the PDs and dates attended are 
as follow: Universal Design for Learning, Maximizing opportunities for ELLs, and Writing 
Language Objectives for ELLs.  PDs will be turn keyed to the other Title III Program teachers 
during the half-hour instructional block each Tuesday.  In the second week of January, just prior 
to the launch of our 14 week program, ELL and Common Branch teachers will meet to layout the 
structure, content and goals of both the literacy program and NYSESLAT test prep.  We will also 
cover the components of NYSESLAT, rubrics used when grading them, and which skills to focus 
on based on current data and the previous year's NYSESLAT scores. The ELL providers will 
lead the planning of the non-fiction whole literacy program. Melissa Marino will lead the 
training and planning for grade 2.  Kathy Ferriola will lead the training and planning for grade 1 , 
Yasmina Keller will lead the training and planning for Kindergarten and grade 3, Maggi Padua 
will lead the training and planning for grades 4 and 5.

  In May, we will host several Family Reading Nights (6:00 to 7:00 p.m.) for students and 
parents.  To make the events age appropriate, we will invite parents of Kindergarten, grades one 
and two during the first evening , and grades three, four and five the following day.  We will 
gather in the library where teachers will model story telling as an art form and how parents can 
address reading strategies to assist parents with improving reading.  Read- alouds should have a 
good sense of timing and bring the characters of the story “to life” through facial expressions and 
voice inflections.  Parents will be provided with ten strategies and a toolkit they can in literacy to 
help their child at home.  To wrap up the evening, goodie bags and snacks will be handed out in 
the cafeteria.We will also have a Library Saturday program for ELLs and their parents once a

month.  The Library will be open 2.0 hours per month (10:00 a.m to 12:00 p.m).   Our 
community need for further literacy education aimed at parents and their young children is 
significant.  Our trained library staff created a developmentally appropriate learning space and 
material collections for families.  Our library serves a culturally and economically diverse 
population that requires greater access to free and engaging literature.  Our Family Library Day 
has allowed us to develop a more comprehensive array of services for our families and 
ELLs.  According to our school's most recent analysis of demographics, 43% of Home 
Languages are English and 44% are Spanish.  Therefore, written translation is provided in-house 
by a school staff member or by the DOE Translation Unit.  In order to meet the needs of our 
students and parents, all school communications (such as calendars, newsletters, invitations etc.) 
are sent home in English and Spanish.   For parents with a language other than Spanish, we have 
made parents aware that they may stop by the school so that we may utilize the DOE translation 
and interpretation unit when necessary.  Each event will have at least one Spanish speaking staff 
member or volunteer available and we often have Arabic and Polish translators for larger scale 
events.  Finally, we encourage families to bring along someone who speaks both English and 
their home language to ensure we have captured their understanding.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
After administration of the NYSITELL, we use Fountas and Pinnell running records as well as Teacher’s College assessments to 
measure the early literacy skills of our ELLs. We combine this data with other formative assessments such as letter-sound 
awareness inventories, running records, conference notes, and teacher made assessments. 
  
When incorporated into classroom practice, the formative assessment process provides information needed to adjust teaching 
and learning while they are still happening. In grades 1 and 2 the formative and curriculum embedded assessments that are 
being used to guide instructional planning for our ELLs are the following: 
-Observations 
-Questioning 
-Discussion 
-Exit Slips 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70 

 

-Thinking Maps 
-ThinkPairShair 
-TCRWP Assessments 
  
In grades 3-5 a variety of formative and curriculum embedded assessments are being used to guide instructional planning for 
the ELLs. Some examples are the following: observations, accountable talk discussions, questioning, Teacher College Running 
records and state assessments. 
  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Administrators, paraprofessionals and vertical and horizontal teacher teams meet and analyze pre-assessments to plan best 
practices which address the identified needs of our students, including those for our SWDs and ELLs.  Horizontal teacher teams 
will meet to analyze student data obtained from summative and formative assessments, student work, projects, and teacher 
feedback to collaboratively address strategies that meet the needs of all learners. Teacher teams meet continuously in order 
to create and modify curriculum maps across instructional domains which address the specific accommodations and scaffolds 
for ELLs and SWDs. Vertical and horizontal teams conduct data inquiry to analyze trends in SWDs and ELLs to develop 
strategies and implement practices to enhance their learning.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
There are many different summative assessments being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need. For 
example,  state-mandated assessments, end of unit assessments, raz-plus ELL assessments used to show Language 
development throughout the school year, TCRWP assessments, and Fundations assessments. 
  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

There are many structures  in place in order to address the interventions once the summative assessment data has been 
gathered. We use the data from the summative assessment to form small groups that address the individual needs of the 
students. The school also provides AIS services to the students who are performing below grade level and we use the data to 
drive the instruction.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Learners and Leaders analyzes the running records and teachers college benchmarks for reading levels throughout the year. 
We use analysis to select English Language Learners who will be serviced with Tier II and Tier III interventions. Ms. Alagna, and 
Ms. Feliciano in our AIS program pull out ELLs that are at risk. They use the Leveled Literacy Intervention Program by Fountas 
and Pinnell. Progress is monitored every 3-5 weeks with Fountas and Pinnell Running Records. The teachers collaborate with 
classroom teachers weekly to ensure all instruction is targeted to specific goals.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The original tool, formerly known as the Data Analysis and AMAO Estimator Tool was used at Learners and Leaders to estimate 
AMAOs 1 and 2 at the school level. The tool allowed us to project the performance of our students at the present moment and 
in the upcoming years. Now the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) has been expanded to analyze student achievement data in the 
content areas, such as Math and ELA. Our school utilizes the early warning system to track factors that have been shown to 
lead to risk of lower academic achievement, such as school attendance.The data yielded from EDAT is used to focus on the 
progress toward achievement of proficiency for specific subgroups of ELLs, and the design of effective instructional programs 
and/or interventions for those students. The factors that can be analyzed include home language, grade level, years of ELL 
service, ELA/math performance and progress, NYSESLAT proficiency and progress, attendance, age, credit accumulation, 
holdover status, SIFE status, and disability classification. The Early Warning (At-Risk) Indicator feature automatically calculates 
the number of risk factors and alerts us to provide interventions.

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 
Data analysis requires the availability of high-quality, targeted data in a format that helps to make adjustments to our 
programs. Learners and Leaders uses Google Drive to collect and share student performance teachers, paraprofessionals and 
administrators.  This data is then easily disaggregated not only by school but by classroom and specific groups of students.  It 
provides a detailed analysis of results by objective or skill in addition to overall scores. Although much of the current emphasis 
on using assessment data began with data from high-stakes tests, our school understands we need to recognize and capitalize 
on the power of classroom assessment. By having student progress tracked both across subject and beyond the school year, 
every aspect of our planning, thinking, and doing is based on the individual needs of our students.  We will also be using 
Mastery Connect to collect and track student performance from classroom assessments. 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

With the exception of our Special Education/bridge classes (which receive pull-out services by certified and highly- 
qualified teachers), ELLs in Kindergarten, 1st grade, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th  are serviced using the Push-In 
model.  Students are grouped by grade in K and 1 as well as in two proficiency bands: Emerging/Entering and 
Transitional/Expanding.  By clustering proficiency levels we are able to provide the mandated Standalone and 
Integrated minutes.    Third grade also receives Push-In ELL services  from an ELL provider and students are of mixed 
proficiency levels.  ELL proficiency levels for these students are heterogeneously grouped.  Self-contained classrooms 
will provide differentiated instruction and flexible grouping as a way to deliver Standalone and Integrated ELL 
instruction.  Small group instruction assists in developing students’ performance in ways that are most successful for 
language acquisition and provides the flexibility we need to comply with CR Part 154.2 . Working in homogeneous 
small groups not only allows students to work with others at their level and abilities but it also lends a malleable 
method for teachers to measure progress of students bolstering their language goals. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Learners and Leaders is able to deliver mandated instructional ENL and ELA minutes. We currently do not have a Home 
Language Program available in our school. We provide Stand-alone ENL instruction to develop English language skills, 180 
minutes for Entering-level and 90 minutes for Emerging-level ELLs of stand-alone ENL are delivered by a certified ENL teacher. 
The required integrated minutes are provided by a certified ENL teacher using a push-in model in both ELA and content areas 
for our transitioning and expanding students. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72 

 

It is clear that helping ELLs (and their English-speaking peers) adjust to the demands of Common Core Standards will provide 
new challenges for educators and for the students themselves. Teachers, paraprofessional aides, and administrators are 
finding creative and effective ways to deliver engaging instruction and professional development. By better understanding 
what the shifts mean and how the mastery of this new approach will benefit our students, we can take the first important 
steps to helping our students succeed with the Common Core State Standards. 
The shifts have important implications for ELLs. Most importantly, ELLs need to be involved in the learning and taking part in a 
way that allows them to experience hands-on, student-centered learning. By having ELLs simply watch the other students 
interact, they are relegated to a position that will not maximize their time spent in the classroom. 
That works hand-in-hand with the second expectation for planning classroom instruction, which is that ELLs need to be fully 
engaged in the learning process. Students learn best by doing. Working in cooperative groups or peer tutoring are two ways 
that involve students in the learning process. 
It's also critical to remember that while learning in collaborative groups is beneficial, an opportunity to be accountable for 
one's own learning is also needed for ELLs. In order to challenge students, teachers need to carefully craft a supportive 
environment and design ways that allow students to take risks, grapple with real-life situations, and problem solve as they will 
be expected to do whether at college or on the job. 
In addition, the Standards establish a shared responsibility for literacy development across the disciplines, not just for the ELL 
teacher. Teachers of ELA, history/social studies, science, and technical subjects are expected to use their content area 
expertise to help students meet the particular challenges of reading, writing, speaking, listening, and language in their 
respective fields. This means that content and literacy are taught simultaneously, providing ELLs with the opportunity to 
strengthen their literacy skills as they acquire content knowledge. 
Finally, these shifts remind us that students have learned at a young age that most questions asked in school have only one 
correct answer. And the keeper of that answer has been the teacher. We know that students have greater retention of 
information when they have the opportunity to discover the answer themselves versus simply being told the answer. The 
process leading to the answer enhances the comprehension of concepts, which is why doing an experiment is far more 
powerful that watching someone else do it. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

As discussed in question 13, The Spanish LAB is administered to students identified as ELLs through NYSITELL whose home 
language is Spanish.  This information helps us to determine the new students’ native language literacy levels.  Since we do not 
have a Dual Language or Transitional Bilingual program, no further instruction or assessment is performed on home language. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. SIFEs are ELLs who have attended schools in the United States for less than twelve months and who, upon initial enrollment 
in such schools are two or more years below grade level in literacy in their home language and/or two or more years below 
grade level in mathematics due to inconsistent or interrupted schooling prior to arrival in the United States.  At the moment 
Learners and Leaders does not have SIFE students. 
b. Newcomer ELLs have received English as a new language instruction for a total of zero to three continuously enrolled school 
years in the United States.  It is critical that we alleviate many newcomers' fears by creating an atmosphere of acceptance and 
welcome in all of our classes.  We assign a buddy to our recently arrived English language learners to boost self esteem and 
help them acclimate into our class.  Newcomers also require modified instruction, collaborative learning opportunities and 
texts.  Some of the characteristics in text for newcomers include: 
c. Developing  ELLs have received English as a new language instruction for a total of four to six years in the US.  This subgroup 
receives our heightened instructional attention because of the prolonged language acquisition process. We utilize intervention 
services (such as AIS and RTI) to alleviate deficiencies and make a rigorous push toward deepening comprehension.  Graphic 
organizers are a means of introducing and assessing concepts in a manner that encourages meaningful learning. Graphic 
organizers show the relationship between new and existing concepts, thereby facilitating integration of new and familiar ideas. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73 

 

They require intermediate-level language and are therefore helpful tools when teaching Developing English language learners.. 
d. Long Term ELLs have received English as a new language instruction for seven years in the US.  At this time there are no long 
term ELLs  enrolled in our school. 
e. Former ELLs are students who had been identified as English language learners and subsequently exited from ELL status. For 
at least two years following the school year in which a student is exited from ELL status, former ELLs receive 90 minutes per 
week of ENL instruction from a certified ENL teacher and are eligible for certain specified testing accommodations and 
carefully monitored differentiated instruction.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
To provide access to academic content areas, accelerate English language development and reach IEP goals for ELLs-SWDs, we 
use flexible grouping for academic intervention. Differentiation and the integration of ELLs into heterogeneous classes based 
on student needs and learning styles provides an opportunity to deliver instruction targeting IEP goals. Co-teaching, as well as 
integrating thematic and project based learning enable teachers to help students attain English proficiency. All service 
providers, including OT, PT and/or speech push-in according to the child’s needs. Service providers, along with the classroom 
teacher, paraprofessionals, and ENL teachers collaborate to discuss ENL strategies in order for the child to meet the IEP goals. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
In terms of instruction and scheduling, our ELLs in Special Education receive ENL services in a manner which does not conflict 
with the schedule of other service providers.  This is done so that we may adhere to mandates and help SWDs achieve their IEP 
goals and accelerate English Proficiency.  Paraprofessionals assigned to students are paired according to home-language when 
available.  All special education students that require bilingual paraprofessional due to their IEP have one.  The number of 
students with disabilities in an integrated Co-teaching class does not exceed 40 percent of the total class register with a 
maximum of 12 students with disabilities.  On a social/behavioral front, our lunch program and recess are organized in a way 
that a variety of children are given the chance to interact with one another.  For example, monolinguals, ELLs, SWDs, and 
general education students are integrated throughout the school day.  Physical activities, assemblies, shows and trips are 
organized in a way that children interact with as many members of the school community as possible.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
English Language Learners who need additional supports that can be served with Tier II and Tier II interventions. As previously 
noted, The AIS teachers pull out ELLs that are at risk. They use the Leveled Literacy Intervention Program by Fontas and Pinnell. 
Progress is monitored every 3-5 weeks with the Fountas and Pinnell Running Records. The AIS providers collaborate with the 
ENL providers ad classroom teachers weekly to ensure all instruction is targeted with specific goals. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Data collection in progress.  Awaiting 2018 NYSESLAT results review data and identify trends. 
 
Based on the upward trend of our ELL performance, we will continue to pursue blended learning.  In other words, Learners and 
Leaders is committed to combining computers with traditional teaching. Knowing that today’s learners are wired at all times, 
teachers are directing students’ natural online proclivity towards schoolwork. It’s referred to as different things — reverse 
teaching, flip teaching, backwards classroom, or reverse instruction. Because of the strong focus we have placed on technology 
in the classroom (and home), students conduct research, watch videos, receive remedial instruction and participate in 
collaborative online discussions in grades K-5.   Our teachers use this technique in different ways. Some assign collaborative 
projects at home, some some assign watching videos and lectures at home and use class time for hands-on projects, some 
place most of the curriculum online and work one-one-one with students in class. However we choose to do it, the best 
examples of blended learning programs involve teachers who use technology and collaborative projects as fuel for content and 
discussion in the classroom. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74 

 

 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Every program in our school is open to all children including our ELLs and Special Education students. Through the YMCA, and 
Masbeth Town Hall,  we provide a supplementary after school program that targets both the social and academic needs of 
students.   We also have family activities on the weekend that invite all of our students with their extended family and siblings 
to engage in art or take trips to cultural landmarks, museums, and attractions in New York City.  In the winter/spring season, 
we provide an after school NYSESLAT Test Prep course. This course is offered to all K-5 ELLs and has yielded high numbers of 
Commanding scores in NYSESLAT in previous years. 
 
 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
 
ELLs that use Raz Kids  can practice reading anytime, anywhere — at home, in school, and even during the summer.  With this 
program we can make assignments and track student progress with online assessments and student recordings.  As a result, 
we are able to view reports for individuals, classrooms, and the entire school. 
  
Struggling students receive additional time with Lexia K–5 literacy solution because it is built around the specific needs of each 
student.  The solution is designed to adapt based on student responses and provide real-time personalization while students 
work independently online. Real-time data from student interaction is sent to the teacher, fueling customized lesson plans 
based on each student's needs.   
  
ELLs in grades 3-5 use iReady in Mathematics and Reading. Students take the i-Ready Diagnostic and receive differentiated 
online instruction according to their ability. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

The Spanish LAB is administered to students identified as ELLs through the NYSITELL whose home language is Spanish.  This 
information helps us to determine the new students’ native language literacy levels.  Since we do not have a Dual Language or 
Transitional Bilingual program, no further instruction or assessment is performed on native language. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Yasmina Keller, Marlene Feliciano, Maggi Padua, Yasheeka Ellis, and Melissa Alagna push into classrooms and provides ENL 
methodologies that support ELLs. All these services correspond with ELLs ages and grade levels. These providers are able to 
differentiate instruction by analyzing student TC running records and literacy comprehension. GoMath as well as Teacher's 
College are aligned with the Common Core State Standards and grade appropriate for students. These programs provide 
scaffolded instruction for ELLs as well as students with special needs. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
N/A 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
ELL parents take part in a parent orientation at the moment of student’s enrollment.  We send home letters and fliers to invite 
parents to meet-the-teacher and curriculum-night.  Our Parent Coordinator and school counselor reach out to parents of ELLs 
to encourage their attendance.   ELL students meet with ENL teachers throughout the day to provide ENL instruction using ENL 
methodology.  These teachers provide engaging activities to provide a risk-free teaching environment for all ELLs.  The 
incoming activities focus on Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills which help the students adapt quickly to their new

our curriculum. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

N/A 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Professional Development at Learners and Leaders is an ongoing part of our goal to grow as professionals and ensure we meet 
the needs of all students. All information learned at trainings is turn-keyed to all ELL providers and classroom teachers. To keep 
up with Chancellor’s regulations and upcoming ELL news, out of classroom ELL teachers are encouraged to attend professional 
development through the office of ELLs. For example, network meetings, LAP training workshops and NYSESLAT training. 
Teachers at Learners and Leaders also attend other instructional workshops such as Teacher's College, ELL Math Institutes, 
Fundations workshops and Brain Research Institutes throughout the year. We use a tracking sheet to sum up the hours of 
professional ELL training we receive throughout the year. 
Learners and Leaders must provide professional development to all teachers and administrators that specifically addresses the 
needs of English language learners. A minimum of fifteen percent of the required professional development hours for all 
teachers must be dedicated to language acquisition. There is a focus on which best practices may be utilized by Learners and 
Leaders for successful co-teaching strategies that integrate language and content instruction for ELLs. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Learners and Leaders offers ongoing professional development to increase teachers' skills.  50% of our PDs are focused on 
acquiring  and strengthening sound pedagogical techniques for students with disabilities and our ENL population. Our 
professional development is based upon data-driven student needs and geared towards research validated practices. All 
Professional Development is matched to curriculum content and aligned with Common Core Learning Standards. Our school 
retains and develops highly qualified teachers by guiding work through collaboration with the teachers on the same grade, 
Professional Development outside of school and from the assistance of colleagues and administration.   
 
Our Pupil Accounting Secretary collects the agendas from teachers who attend any out of building Professional 
Developments.  We also maintain records of sign-in sheets  from workshops that occur within our school.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
As per new regulations, our school must individually meet with the parents or guardians of ELLs at least once a year, in 
addition to parent teacher conferences and initial parent orientations.  Contact with parents is commonplace at Learners and 
Leaders so this mandate will neither surprise parents or belabor teachers who are accustomed to discussions about our 
ELLs.  During these meetings we will review goals of the program, their child’s language development progress, their 
assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. This meeting is conducted with a qualified 
interpreter/translator in a language that the parent or guardian best understands. To validate these meetings, we record 
attendance using ELL dept. procedures for parent outreach. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

To foster parental involvement in our school we have an open door policy for all parents.  All parents are welcomed and 
encouraged to participate and be familiar with all content instruction and add to their child's learning goals by offering at 
home and in school support.  Specifically, we offer parent workshops in literacy to help our parents build their literacy skills at 
home.  Parents are strongly encouraged to attend field trips.  We provide family weekend outings organized by our teachers 
and Parent Coordinator to help our families explore and learn about areas outside our community.  We hold Arts and Crafts 
Saturdays at our school where families can come to our school and participate in an arts activity.  Translation is always 
provided in all of our parental activities, either through fluent bilingual staff members or through the use of the Department of 
Education Translation phone line.  Also, Learners and Leaders holds game night, exercise classes, movie night and healthy 
cooking tips for families.    Learners and Leaders offers ENL classes for adults which takes place daily in the school building.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Lynn Botfeld, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Written and oral language preferences are initially assessed using the final portion of the Home Language 
Identification Survey. Parents are instructed to indicate what language they would like to be notified by phone 
and mail. This information is inputted into ATS and accessed regularly on the Adult Preferred Language Report 
(RAPL) prior to contacting parents. Student Emergency Contact cards are provided in English and Spanish.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

Emergencies are best managed when there is a plan in place. Learners and Leaders is committed to increasing 
parental awareness regarding their right to availability of language services. Likewise, school personnel is aware of its 
responsibilities to communicate with parents in their native language, even in urgent times. 

In the event of a school emergency we utilize staff members and volunteers to quickly reach parents who prefer a 
language other than English.  
  
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Our Language Access Coordinator (Yasmina Keller) will turnkey the language access information to the school 
personnel. 
Ms. Keller is trained in Chancellor's Regulation A-663 and required to keep school staff (including PTA, SLT and 
Teachers, Paras and volunteers) informed on policies and procedures.  
Learners and Leaders will monitor school announcements, calendars, newsletters and conferences to ensure that all 
relevant school personnel is aware and complies with CR A-663. 
 
At our first school wide meeting, we reminded teachers to utilize components of our Language Access Kits available in 
high access areas, such as ELL teacher office, main office, and security desk. Teachers received brochures about the 
services provided by the Translation and Interpretation Unit and an over-the-phone cards with information on how to 
access a translator. The multilingual welcome poster is clearly visible in our hallway, a Language Identification Guide 
to help determine the language spoken by a parent is in the ELL office and sample "I Speak" Cards for parents are 
available in high traffic areas, such as the corridor near main office.  

  

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

 

 

Multilingual posters are displayed in a highly visible location. These posters provide LEP parents instruction on where 
and how to obtain interpretation services. Our school website, www.305online.comb provides parents and students 
English and translated information and a link to http://schools.nyc.gov/Parents Families/ Hello which includes 
additional multilingual signage that can be downloaded, printed and posted.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Ensuring the quality of our language services is critical to communicating effectively with our LEP parents. The T & I 
Unit works in collaboration with Learners and Leaders to ensure our language services are successful. 

 

Learners and Leaders utilizes the following mechanisms to gather feedback and improve language services: 

  Principal Satisfaction Survey – Assess the central supports provided to schools, including the T & I Unit and 

external language service providers. 

  T & I Customer Satisfaction Survey – Assess services by the T & I Unit. 
 

School Survey for Parents – Survey made available to parents to assess whether or not our school is 
communicating with parents in their preferred language. 

  Monitoring of Multilingual Welcome Poster – We understand random visits to our school are necessary to 

determine if we have the required multilingual welcome poster visibly posted.
