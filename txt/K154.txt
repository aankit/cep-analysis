Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

PS154 is a collaborative community that is committed to inspiring curiosity, integrity, independence and academic 
excellence in our children. We do this by encouraging exploration across all areas of study and the engagement of the 
cultural institutions of New York City. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

PS154, The Windsor Terrace School, is a Kindergarten - Grade 5 public school in the Windsor Terrace section of 
Brooklyn. Our school building is a neighborhood landmark, having been constructed in 1909. Our community services 
a student population of diverse ethnic backgrounds and abilities. We believe that children learn best in an 
emotionally-safe environment that encourages risk-taking and that truly great teaching does not ascribe to a single 
philosophy; it’s fluid and responsive to student need. 

PS154 is a high-performing school. Approximately 80% of students are performing at or above grade level standards 
on standardized exams in literacy and math. PS 154 strives to enrich the lives of our students through various arts 
programs, a science-rich curriculum and the infusion of technology into our learning experiences. Our partnerships 
and enrichment opportunities include the Brooklyn Museum, NY Historical Society, Tiny Scientist, Dance in the 
Classroom, Chess with Imagination Guru and American Sign Language. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

PS154 supports the following special, student population: 5% ENL and 18% students with disabilities. Based on the 
2017 State data our students receiving ENL services and SWD exceeded the district averages in ELA and Math. To 
support our students we maintain one ICT class on each grade as well as a SETSS provider. Our ENL students are 
supported by a certified instructor who utilizes both pull-out and push-in models.  

 

In addition, PS154 supports students through a responsive Related Service department including; Speech and 
Language, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy and Counseling.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

PS154 made the most significant gain in the Supportive Environment component of the the Framework for Great 
Schools. We reached our goal of training over 40% of the staff in Responsive Classroom.  

An area of focus for the 2018-2019 school year will address the quality and quantity of science instruction. Our 
teachers will cover the science curriculum using classroom science centers and the school's lab. Our goal is for 
classroom teachers to incorporate hands-on learning opportunities that are integrated with ELA and math standards.  

We will be continuing our exploration of Social Emotional learning for the school entire community. Last year, we 
invested in Responsive Classroom training for the majority of our staff members. We aim to have the remainder of 
our community trained this year and establish clear expectations for how RC will be implemented consistently and 
uniformly in classrooms and non-classroom locations. Additionally, we will be developing a school-wide positive 
behavior program to support this work in all areas of the building.  

To enhance our Response to Intervention model we will be investing in literacy training for our special education 
teachers, ENL and AIS provider. Read, Write Inc. is a research based literacy program that supports students struggling 
with foundational literacy skills. Developing a consistent literacy program that generates meaningful data will help 
identify students who require further supports and services.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
2018 State ELA data reflects the following: 

English as a new language - 100% of our students scored within Level 1 and Level 2 

Students with disabilities- 56% of our students scored within Level 1 and Level 2 

These scores reflect a need for a more diverse approach to instruction that includes; hands-on learning activities and 
integrated curriculum. The Amplify science curriculum incorporates ELA skills which will increase our students' 
exposure to literacy concepts within an engaging content area. 

Strengths: 

1. A dedicated science laboratory 

2. Two periods a week of science, one will be in the science lab.  

3. PTA allocation earmarked for science enrichment instruction through the Tiny Scientist organization. 

4. Visiting Scientist Day and "Science-tastic Day" 

5. High overall performance on the 4th grade assessment 

6. Highly qualified classroom teachers who are eager to teach science.  

7. An active science committee consisting of SLT members meeting monthly to provide support and recommendations 
for the development of the program. 

 

NEEDS: 

1. Professional support and professional development targeting a roll out of the Amplify Science curriculum.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12 

 

2. Dedicated time for teachers to plan together and debrief science lessons. 

3. Continued review of the Next Generation Standards to ensure that the curriculum remains engaging, inquiry based, 
hands on and integrated with ELA and Math content.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
 

Strengths 

1.  The school formed a Social and Emotional Experience (SEE) Committee during the 2015-2016 school year. The 

SEE Committee currently has 68 members consisting of school staff and parents and works to support Social 
and Emotional Learning at the school and coordinate evening parent workshops on various topics related to 
SEL. 

 

 

 

 

2.  The school’s Social and Emotional Experience (SEE) Committee partnered with individual providers and 

organizations to offer 5 evening parent workshops to enhance classroom and school culture for students this 
year. Workshop topics included Mindfulness (individual provider), Emotional Intelligence (Kimochis), Raising 
Resilient Girls (Girl’s Leadership), Anxiety and Self-Esteem (Understood), Parenting skills (individual providers). 
Parent workshops were well attended with attendance ranging from 25-80 parents. 

3. 

In May of 2017 the PTA voted to allocate $21,000 to fund the four-day Responsive Classroom training for up 
to 30 teachers from the school. The training was conducted on site during the 2017-2018 school year, with 2 
days completed in November 2017 and 2 days completed in June of 2018. A total of 16 teachers from PS 154 
attended the training and they were joined by several additional teachers from nearby schools. Responsive 
Classroom offers a one-day training for cluster area teachers, and this training was attended by 5 cluster 
teachers and one school aide in February of 2018. Approximately $8,000 remains from the original $21,000 
allocation as a result of cost sharing with the nearby schools that sent teachers to the onsite 4-day training. 

4.  Teachers who completed the first 2 days of RC training in November of 2017 were provided with the 

opportunity to attend optional monthly meetings to support each other in adopting RC in their classrooms 
(peer support). Many teachers took advantage of these monthly meetings and the overall interest in RC was 
reported as being high. The overall enthusiasm for RC has been described as high by many of the teachers 
who attended the first 2 days of training in November of 2017 and teacher interest and enthusiasm have been 
identified by the SLT as the strongest indicators of program success thus far. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          17 

5.  Responsive Classroom conducted a full-day, on-site observation and feedback site visit in April of 2018. The 

visit culminated in a School Growth Profile rating how well a sample of teachers from the school used the 
practices, knowledge, skills and dispositions of the RC core training to create classroom conditions aligned 
with the four RC Domains. The four RC Domains are Effective Management, Positive Community, 
Developmentally Responsive, and Engaging Academics and combined scores in each domain ranged from 
2.63-2.78, with a maximum available score of 3.0 in each domain. Additional observations were conducted in 
non-classroom spaces however these areas were not formally rated during the April 2018 site visit. 

 

 

 

Needs 

 

1.  Our school’s results in the Supportive Environment element have decreased each year over the past three 

years resulting in a total decline of .52 since the 2014-2015 school year. Of the 5 framework elements 
addressed by the CEP, Supportive Environment is the only framework element that has three consecutive 
years of declining scores on the School Quality Report, and our net change in Supportive Environment over 
the past three years is the most negative of all 6 framework elements.  

2.  The Supportive Environment Subcommittee of the SLT completed an in-depth inquiry of lunch and recess to 
identify specific concerns during those times. Inquiry consisted of requesting input from the SEE Committee 
(parents/staff), interviewing school staff present during lunch/recess and meeting with teachers. Results of 
the inquiry were shared with the SLT and the SLT reached consensus that the following issues with lunch and 
recess should be addressed by the SLT in the 2018-2019 CEP:  

1.  Lunch: Lack of staff supervision  
2.  Lunch: Not enough time to eat 
3.  Recess: Frequency and intensity of student conflicts 
4.  Recess: No process to resolve conflicts that occur during recess 
5.  Recess: Communication system regarding conflicts at recess 
6.  Recess: Student exclusionary behavior 
7.  Recess: Number and variety of activities 
8.  Lunch/Recess: Supervision during transitions 

3.  The principal presented a Responsive Classroom (RC) implementation plan to the SLT at the April 2018 SLT 
meeting highlighting activities that were necessary to support and sustain Responsive Classroom. Specific 
activities included the following: 

1. 

Identify and support one RC teacher-ambassador to help train teachers and staff who did not receive 
RC training during the 2017-2018 school year 

2.  Work with external RC Consultant to determine 5 points of RC that will become part of school-wide 

implementation. 

3.  During 2018-2019 work to ensure the 5 points become part of the daily PS 154 routine. 
4.  By fall 2019 entire school will be using 5 points of RC practice on a daily basis 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths 

1.  Teachers work collaboratively in grade-bands and in vertical inquiry groups across content areas. 
2.  Teachers have extensive working knowledge of Teachers College Reading and Writing Program strategies to 

integrate into math instruction 

Needs 

1.  Focus on creating a more engaging, hands-on experience in math for all students. 
2.  Focus on creating an environment in which the lowest performing students and students with special needs 

have multiple access points and positive experiences in math. 

3.  Create streamlined assessments that accurately reflect students’ skills and knowledge. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, teachers will create hands-on, scaffolded math lessons and activities that have multiple entry points for 
all learners and a variety of opportunities to express understanding, resulting in 75% of SWDs (in grades 3-5 ICT) 
progressing at least two indicators towards expert level using a grade level on-demand task (word problem) and 
assessed with an “Exemplar” math rubric. (Novice, Apprentice, Practitioner, Expert)

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

While survey data shows that the vast majority of parents are very happy with school-family-community relationships, 
families who have children with IEPs are much less satisfied with how we serve their children, based on survey results. 

Strengths 

Almost all parent questions on the 2016-17 School Quality Guide are rated 95% satisfied or higher, including: 

  95% of parents agree that school staff communicates regularly with them about how their child can learn. 
  96% of parents/guardians agreed or strongly agreed that teachers work closely with them to meet their 

child's needs. 

  97% of parents feel well-informed by the school. 
  99% are satisfied with the language and method of communication. 
  98% of parents feel warmly greeted by staff at the school. 

 

Needs 

Parents of children with special needs have concerns as stated in the 2016-2017 School Quality Guide. While these are 
not grouped under the “Family-Community Ties” bucket, we would like to reach out to these families and better 
support them in their experience at PS 154. These are the lowest-scoring answers of any question answered by 
parents in the School Quality Guide Survey: 

  58% of parents/guardians of a child who receives special education services through an Individualized 

Education Program (IEP) agreed or strongly agreed that they are satisfied with the educational planning and 
IEP development process at their school. (Q9a) 

  65% of parents/guardians of a child who receives special education services through an Individualized 

Education Program (IEP) agreed or strongly agreed that their school works to achieve the goals on their child's 
IEP. (Q9b) 

  50% of parents/guardians of a child who receives special education services through an Individualized 

Education Program (IEP) agreed or strongly agreed that their school offers a wide variety of activities and 
services (including related services and assistive and adaptive technologies where appropriate) to help 
improve life outcomes for their child. (Q9c) 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

While not a Title 1 school, PS154 feels strongly that routine reflection and enhancement of the parent engagement 
policy supports the school-home connection and results in stronger relationships, trust and opportunities for our 
students. Our objective is to create avenues for clear communication, feedback and collaboration with our parent 
body. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Teacher Association and 
various school and committees to support the education of all students.  

 

PS 154, The Windsor Terrace School, will support parents and families by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, social emotional development, art(s) and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments, the IEP process 
and supports for our ENL population.

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community;  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school surveys and 
feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and enhance the 
school’s Parent Engagement program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.gESSA/State accountability 
system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning 
Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:

and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand. 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

P.S. 154, The Windsor Terrace School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student 
Succeeds Act (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student 
achievement between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and 
programs funded by Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will 
share responsibility for improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be 
developed to ensure that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
     PS 154 uses a variety of assessment tools to gather information regarding the needs of its students, including ELLs.  The 
primary assessment tools are: State assessments, Running Records (TCRWP), Go Math assessments, Engage NY Math tasks. 
Once a year, the NYSESLAT exam is administered to assess the progress of the ELL population.  Using the data results of the 
NYSESLAT will help inform our ENL school's instruction. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

     Teacher collaboration and conferencing, assessment of student progress, parent/teacher conferencing all support efforts to 
inform instruction and to ascertain those students who need small group or individualized instruction, or further evaluation. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
     We use the HLA, parent interview and NYSITELL results to determine the baseline levels for all new ELLs .  To monitor 
progress we use informal assessments, teacher conferences, and the yearly NYSESLAT, focusing on RLAT scores each year.  In 
addition,  the ENL teacher confers with the IEP teacher, the school psychologist, the school social worker, or the school 
counselor when appropriate to ensure that ELL’s who need additional assistance are receiving the appropriate support and 
meeting their specific goals.   The ENL teacher attends IEP meetings for all ENL students. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  
     Tier 2 RTI includes: small group instruction; individualized or one to one instruction; teacher collaboration 
and  informal assessments. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Student progress toward meeting grade level goals is monitored at regular intervals by teachers and support staff.  A pacing 
calendar is provided to staff and monitored by grade leaders and administration. 
 
Weekly "Child Study" (PPC) meetings are facilitated to review assessment data and referrals. Class work, quantitative and 
qualitative data is reviewed to support future interventions.  
 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
     Scores on the NYSESLAT and the academic domains are evaluated and compared.   ELL's who are at lower proficiency levels 
on the NYSESLAT usually have lower scores on state exams including Science, ELA and Math.   The Listening, Speaking, Reading, 
and Writing scores on the NYSESLAT are evaluated and emphasis in instruction is targeted according to individual student 
needs. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

     Coordinated efforts that include teacher conferencing/ collaboration with ENL teacher and other support staff when 
appropriate informs classroom teachers of students' areas of need.   

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Standalone ENL- All students are in small group with the ENL teacher in a separate location.  No more than 2 
proficiency levels are grouped together.   An effort is made to see Identified Tier 2 or Tier 3 students in pairs or in a 
one-to-one setting, while still keeping with the model of no more than 2 different grade levels / proficiency levels 
(determined by NYSESLAT scores).  Group times are based on mandated hours with Transitioning or Expanding 
receiving 180 hours of instruction weekly and Emerging and Entering receiving 360 hours of instruction weekly. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

N/A 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

The ENL teacher works in collaboration with the administration to create a schedule that meets the mandated times.  
Special consideration is made to ensure that ENL students are not missing specialty classes or enrichment activities. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
     The ENL teacher works in collaboration with the classroom teachers to deliver content area instruction.  While instruction is 
offered in English, there are a Spanish speaking paraprofessionals to support translations when necessary. In addition,   a 
Mandarin speaking, certified teacher is available for support.  The ENL teacher has been trained in teaching all the domains of 
ENL during the 2017-18 school year by the R-BERN presenters at Fordham Univ.  The ENL teacher has been trained in Wilson 
Reading and Writing,  a Tier 2 and 3 method, and which follows the related Tier 1 Fundations program provided by the 
classroom teachers.  The ENL teacher is also NY certified in Students with Disabilities and is able to provide enhanced 
instruction of Common Core for struggling or at risk  ELLs.   
      The instructional materials used to support ELL's include grade level and/or proficiency level materials specifically designed 
for ELL students in all four domains of English.  Also, Common Core materials reflect the student's grade level are used when 
appropriate.  These Common Core materials are often the same as what is currently taught in their grade or classroom. 
     Strategies used: 
Graphic organizers, charts/diagrams, pantomime, role playing,  audio/visuals, technology, content area themes, differentiated 
instruction, group or buddy collaboration, discreet skills breakdown, bilingual dictionaries in different reading levels, song 
writing and singing, storyboards and word walls. 
 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

     In our Standalone ENL program, ELLs at PS 154 are  evaluated in English.  In addition, the Spanish LAB-R is administered  to 
Spanish speaking students who do not pass the NYSITELL.  If a student has special needs, and is considered dominant in a 
language other than English, the student is evaluated in the native language.         
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Upon identification as SIFE, students receives an evaluation to determine needed areas of targeted and intensified 
instruction.  Collaboration with classroom teacher occurs and a close monitoring of student progress is 
implemented.  Newcomers are encouraged to use their home language in the writing and speaking domains to foster inclusion 
and acceptance into the academic and social community of the classroom. Sharing connections with their culture and language 
is encouraged among all ESL students for the same reason.  
Developing students are supported with more instruction as needed by the ENL teacher.  
Long term student progress is evaluated by classroom teachers and the ENL teacher to determine areas of needed and 
specialized instruction for that student.  
Former ELLs are regularly monitored and assessed by the ENL teacher.  ENL teacher collaborates with the classroom 
teacher  to determine if there is adequate progress toward grade level or if there are areas of need.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Strategies: 
Graphic organizers, visuals, vocabulary keys with simplified definitions, pre teaching, conceptual mapping/sorting of academic 
material, use of student illustration of academic concepts, teacher inquiry, discussion pairs or groups, student collaboration 
and presentation.  
Teachers focus on important targeted concepts that are transferable to other domains of Common Core.  In the classrooms, 
teachers use technology such as smart boards and document cameras allowing visuals and audio to enhance 
learning/comprehension, to keep students engaged with the task  
     
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The classroom teacher, ENL Speech, OT, and IEP teachers regularly confer and collaborate to enhance student progress, 
making sure that the student receives continuity, consistency, compatibility  and reinforcement of concepts and grade level 
standards.  
 
ENL scheduling is adjusted to allow for student involvement in their grade's academic or extended learning 
activities.  Flexibility is a requirement of the ENL teacher and there are many opportunities to integrate lessons in the regular 
education classroom.           
 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
ELA-  Wilson reading, small groups based on running record data, fundations  
Math- Small group work, re-teaching strategies and focus on foundational skills and comprehension 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Read, Write Inc.- A research based phonics program. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
     All of our ELL students are invited to attend morning AIS, or after school sessions which offers enrichment in both math and 
literacy and homework assistance.  Students are grouped with by grade level and with similar academic needs.  There are 
after-school programs that offer music or other enrichment opportunities to our ELLs  These programs are well attended by 
our ELLs. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
     Instructional materials such as laptops, ipads, smart boards, and listening devices, and foreign language dictionaries all aid 
students in language acquisition. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

     In our Free Standing ESL program, English is used.  With lower proficiency students,  native language examples in writing or 
speaking are accepted and shared with other students in their regular classroom or the ENL classroom.  Particularly in the 
beginning, students are encouraged to share what they can in whatever language they speak or write, as a gateway to learning 
their new language, English.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

 

Students in the regular classroom who speak the same language as the newcomer are encouraged to share and 
collaborate.  The goals are to support the newcomer in the transition to a new environment/culture,  relieve unnecessary 
stress, foster community and to partner with the newcomer during the class' movement times throughout the daily schedule. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Students are grouped by age and grade level in the regular classroom and in the ENL classroom, if possible.  No more that one 
grade level or one proficiency level separates the students in within a small group.  Many high quality materials for each grade 
level and proficiency level are provided. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
N/A 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Newcomers enrolled before the beginning or after the start of the school year are given a tour of the school by the ENL 
teacher.  During the tour, the student is introduced to staff, the physical layout of the school and the ENL program.  The new 
student is introduced or partnered for a time to other ENL students who are currently in the program or who have been 
reclassified.  These students are ENL Buddies who help guide the newcomer in school or classroom procedures during 
transitions throughout the school day.  An effort is made to introduce to the newcomer specifically those students from the 
same countries or regions of the world as the newcomer.   These students may or may not have been in the ENL program but 
are familiar with or can speak the newcomer's native tongue and know the culture of the newcomer.   
 
Students are offered picture dictionaries for regular classroom use, or for borrowing for home use.    TPR is used to 
communicate and to teach vocabulary.  Picture cards, story books and informational books with pictures, graphs, diagrams, 
charts are used to build vocabulary and develop concepts.   We work together as a school community to foster tolerance, 
acceptance and an atmosphere of inclusion for our ENLs and SWD's. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

N/A 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction?

N/A    
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
     The ENL teacher brings ideas, strategies, and teacher materials from attended PD's which focus on the instruction of ELL's, 
ELL's with IEP's, and Newcomers.  The ENL teacher targets the four domains of speaking, listening, reading and writing as 
presented by the R-BERN at Fordham University.

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
     Teachers are informed of and encouraged to attend the PD opportunities presented by R-BERN at Fordham University or by 
the NYCDOE.  Agendas collected for specific PD's that teachers have attended are filed. 
 
Additionaly,  PS154 dedicates time during the mandated PD time on Monday afternoons to exploring ENL instruction and 
strategies. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The  parent coordinator sends  monthly meeting dates and times through the ENL teacher and also helps facilitate parent 
meetings and translation services as needed. 
 
Besides the general Curriculum Orientation meeting at the beginning of the school year for parents of all students, including 
ENL students, there  is a separate ENL Parent Orientation meeting.  
 
Parents of ENL students are welcomed to visit the ENL classroom, and call, email, or meet with the teacher before, during, or 
after school at their convenience.  
 
Parents of ENL students who are new to the school are given an orientation that informs them of options within the district, 
describes the curriculum of the ENL classroom, and addresses questions or concerns.  
 
Supporting educational materials, suggestions, and strategies that may assist their student's academic and language 
acquisition are made available to parents.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Our Parent Coordinator is available to help serve as liaison with our parent community and our our PTA's Diversity Committee 
to help assess the needs for all our students and families.  Throughout the year, parents come to the school to take part in 
many community celebrations, including holiday luncheons, international festivals and cultural days.  We have Family 
Fridays  once per month which is a favorite among parents of all students including ENL students.  During all of these events, 
student achievement in academics and the arts is recognized.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jason Foreman, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

All parents/guardians of newly enrolled students fill out a Home Language Survey when enrolling their child. This 
form is maintained as part of the student’s record. If the parent/guardian indicates on the HLIS that they would 
like to receive information from the school in their home language, forms being sent home are translated either in 
written form or orally to the parent/guardian. Information from teachers is translated to parents by staff 
members who speak the home language.  

The DOE Translation and Interpretation Unit will be utilized if a parent/guardian should request services that we 
are unable to provide. This was indicated on the HLIS as well as confirmed orally by a pedagogue who speaks the 
parents' home language. During parent orientation, the parents provide requests for language preference and 
they document their language preference on the emergency contact cards. Parent surveys are distributed in 
Bengali, the language requested, as well as English which has been requested by the parents. The ATS Report of 
Preferred Languages is updated regularly in order to maintain accurate information on parent language choices ( 
RAPO ATS Report). Parent Blue Cards are also updated regularly to keep parent language choices current. Parent

surveys are given out by the parent coordinator in order to maintain accurate data on parent language choices. 
Teachers also send home surveys by backpack or during parent conferences in order to collect parent data by 
class/grade. A report is generated using a variety of data sets in order to regularly update the languages that 
parents speak by class and/or grade.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report. 
 

Language  

Written 
Preferred  

Percent 
Written  

Oral Preferred  

Percent Oral  

Approximately ninety-five percent of the 
school’s population reports English as the 
primary language. The remaining three 
percent speak Spanish, Mandarin, Russian, 
Urdu and German. The school’s 
demographic is made available on the 
school’s official DOE website and is 
periodically reported in our school’s 
newsletter. Teachers whose parents have 
elected to receive information in their 
home language have had this information 
communicated to them by the ENL 
teacher/coordinator. All language needs 
are met through the utilization of the DOE 
Translation and Interpretation Unit. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A. 
 

 

 

 
 
Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services 
 
1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be 

distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.

announcements, ELL parent orientation information letters, 
NYSESLAT testing notification and calendar, other NYS testing dates, 
curriculum overview, ELL entitlement and non-entitlement letters, as 
well as letters from the school leadership. Curriculum information is 
sent at the beginning of the school year. Testing dates and calendars 
are provided as soon as they become available in order to allow 
parent/guardians to prepare themselves as well as their children for 
upcoming events. Parent's Bill of Rights are distributed as they 
become available to the school. School annoucements, after school 
program information, general overview of student curriculum and 
letters from school leadership is translated in order to keep all 
parents aware and engaged on all school matters.  

   

 

2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as 

parent-teacher  
conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.

P.S. 154 holds three parent conferences throughout the school year. 
The first, in September, introduces parents to their children's new 
grade and provides curriculum information. The next two, held in 
November and May, are focused on student progress and grades. The 
ENL teacher holds a parent orientation for any newly enrolled ELL 
parent/guradian as well as separate meetings for individual ELL 
parent/guardians throughout the year. Teachers communicate with 
parents throughout the year in order to address questions/concerns 
ad well as any possible issues in or outside of the classroom. If 
necessary, the guidance counselor will also be present during such 
meetings. In addition to these meetings, a designated one to one 
parent conference will take place annually in order to provide 
updates on student progress as mandated by CR Part 154.
