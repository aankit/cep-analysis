Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The Children’s Workshop School, founded in 1993, is a progressive public elementary school located on the East 
Village of Manhattan. As stated in our Mission, CWS strives for students to be open-minded and compassionate; to 
gain a sense of themselves and others; and to understand and appreciate the diversity of the community. Children are 
guided and supported to fulfill their creative, physical, emotional, social and intellectual potential. Our goal is for our 
children to recognize that they have the power and resources to effect change and expect them to grow to be 
responsible, critical and caring members of a pluralistic society. We design instruction based on our integrated Social 
Studies curriculum with a strong focus on diversity and social justice. Each January, we celebrate the vision and dream 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. with an all-school concert that reaffirms our hope for a just and peaceful world. Teachers 
work with the students to develop class performances and every child has the opportunity to be a part of the 
presentation. It is a moving and exhilarating experience. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

An alternative "choice" public school for children from pre-kindergarten through fifth grade, CWS was formed by 
Principal Maria Velez-Clarke and Jean Finnerty , at the request of the then superintendent and instructional staff, who 
wanted to give families in the Lower East Side access to a progressive, smaller, child-centered public school. The two 
educators had worked together at Central Park East and shared a vision of dynamic, and progressive education. Maria 
Velez-Clarke’s consistent vision, profound and insightful knowledge of children, and experience as an educator 
continue to inform and guide CWS as it grows and evolves. We currently have approximately 323 plus students, a 
combination of families who have been a part of our school community for many years and families new to the 
neighborhood who are looking for a progressive educational setting.  

 

This is evidenced by our growing waiting lists, the number of families who have visited our school as part of the choice 
process and the rise in student population. Our growth, however, has not hindered our commitment to maintaining a 
small progressive school, whose students possess a full range of racial, linguistic, and cultural heritages, income levels 
and learning abilities. Our demographics reflect the diversity of the neighborhood, and we provide support to a small 
ENL population and to those children whose IEPs mandate related services (SETTS, ICT, Speech and Language, OT, PT, 
Counseling etc.) We also have a Reading Recovery program in an effort to provide intensive individualized literacy 
instruction to first graders identified as needing extra reading support. We have a stable and experienced teaching 
staff who collaborate with each other and share best practices in differentiated instruction as part of our ICT program.  

 

Because of strong parental involvement, we have been able to add many enrichment programs including Instrumental 
Music and Band, Library and Media Center program. We continue to enjoy a productive partnership with Manhattan 
Country School, including a week long Farm Program for 4th graders and The Living the Dream Book Award, a joint 
project with MCS 5th graders, as well as ongoing partnerships with Movement Research, Turtle Bay Music School, a 
school wide Bent on Learning Yoga Program, PEP (Physical Education Program), Swim for Life for all 2 nd graders,, 
STAR Adolescent Education program for the 5 th graders. Our 5 th grade curriculum culminates with a trip to 
Washington DC to meet with legislators, and participate in the political process. 

 

We consider the arts to be integral to a child's learning experience. We therefore provide many opportunities in the 
classroom by integrating the arts into our regular school day schedule and curriculum. This is done in an effort to 
provide access to every child in our school community. If the arts were to be offered before or after school it would 
become exclusive instead of inclusive. Through our collaboration of over twenty years with Turtle Bay Music School, 
every child from PreK to 5th grade is able to participate in an Orff Music and recorder program. Third through fifth 
graders have the opportunity to audition and participate in the school Band. Both programs are funded in part from 
Arts grants that are supplemented by the PTA. Every child from PreK to fifth grade attends the Art Studio once a week 
with our Art teacher. Art projects are planned and developed to reflect their Social Studies curriculum. 

The PTA is an integral part of the school. It supports Arts programming in the school by organizing and coordinating 
fundraisers through out the year. i.e An October Harvest Festival, a Holiday Craft Fair, and two Barnes and Noble Book 
Fairs to raise funds to maintain our beautiful library and its 10,000 volume collection. Every Spring, our school 
community hosts two large celebrations; an Art & Science Fair in May for the children and community, and our 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

primary fundraising event, Schoolapalooza, a food, entertainment, art and silent auction extravaganza for the parents 
and friends of the school. We also have an extensive fee based afterschool clubs program open to all grades 5 days a 
week. It is organized and run by the PTA with all profits going to provide scholarships for families who need support. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Approximately 21% of our students have IEPs with mandates for for receiving related services such as speech, 
guidance Physical Therapy Occupational therapy and support in using asistive technology devices.  

We also have approximately 50 students in Temporary housing who need support with after school care, and 
assistance in dealing with the daily routines of getting to school as well as understanding and working with social 
service agencies and departments. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

We have a technology team made up of administrators, teachers and parents, which has been successful in obtaining 
grants for technology and training. All of our classrooms are outfitted with Promethean or Smartboards and each 
teaching cohort has access to laptops for guided online research with their students.  

We truly consider ourselves to be a collaborative community. Decisions and new initiatives are reviewed by our high 
functioning School Leadership Team. Each week families, children and teachers come together at Community 
Meeting, when classes share performances, outside guests present special programs, students and teachers share 
poetry and stories. Most importantly, we come together as a joyful group to celebrate our unique, multi-talented and 
loving CWS family.  

 

One of the ways we have continued to make progress this year and carried over from last year, was in the areas of 
Supportive Environment and Strong Family Community Ties. 

 

We identified several areas of concern that we wanted to partner with parents in a more effective way: 1.) 
Attendance and its impact on student performance, 2.) Our scaffolded Math Curriculum and 3.) Student internet 
usage and its impact on student safety and the social dynamics in the school community. We were able to bring 
parents in for workshops and discussions to address concerns about these issues, and identify strategies for the 
students, parents and staff to work together. 

 

We continue to work on expanding our parent base and reach beyond our substantial group of parents who are 
already invested and involved. The Technology team continues to work on rolling out a school-wide communication 
tool in order for classroom teachers and staff to communicate on a regular basis with parents about curricular units, 
homework, new initiatives, in-school activities and events. We hope to improve all parents' understanding of our 
educational approaches, state standards and the way we design and implement curriculum. To this end we designed 
and presented two parent workshops that were very successful; 

The first was on conflict Resolution and Bullying, the second was on Transitions, which included an open house where 
parents were able to visit classrooms and to gain an understanding of expectations and goals for their child's next 
grade. since most of our classrooms from 1st to 5th grade are on the third floor we attempted to demistify the third 
floor.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
After meeting with 3rd graders and their teachers, to discuss the impact of the departmentalization plan on student 
performance and progress, the 3rd grade teachers decided to move forward and continue with the implementation of 
the plan and bring it up to the fourth grade group that they would be looping with. This would then allow one teacher 
to solely focus on mathematics and social studies, while another teacher focuses on reading and writing, In order for 
the needs of all the fourth grade students This will allow teachers the time to deepen their own understanding of 
these particular areas and meet the needs of individual learners. By only focusing on 2 of the 4 core classroom 
subjects, the teachers can then increase the level of customization they can provide to each child. This would be the 
third year of departmentalization with these two grades at the end of which we would be able to analyze student 
data gathered from teacher authentic assessment, student performance, progress and test scores. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
Within the 2018/2019 school year, 4th grade students will receive a more individualized and deeper learning experience 
and will demonstrate an increased understanding in content subjects, including a higher reading level, as teachers will 
be looping from 3rd grade to 4th grade and will continue the departmentalization of core content subjects., which was 
piloted two years ago in the 3rd grade. This pilot will be reviewed and assessed at the end of this third year of 
implementation, and the findings will be shared with the staff and used to determine whether it should be continued 
and become part of the school culture. and curriculum.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Meet with parents in order to discuss this new 
departmentalization plan and the roles and responsibilities of 
teachers, students and families. 

Group students in 2 diverse groups with emphasis on academic 
abilities, race/ethnic backgrounds and gender. These groups are 
separate from the homeroom groups, so students get to interact 
with different peers. Create a schedule for students to rotate 
classrooms and academic subjects, while maintaining 
homerooms, and the participation of the ICT teacher for 
differentiating instruction

Teachers will plan together regularly in order to know what is 
happening in the other subjects. However, by teaching the same 
subject for 2 periods with 2 different groups, it gives each 
teacher additional time to prepare content, modify work for a 
variety of learning abilities and ENL learners.

The School leadership, Parents and staff working collaboratively with network attendance manager studies research 
and school data at the end of the 2018-2019 school year, illuminating the relationship of student presence within the 
context of engaged learning experiences. Subsequently the school identifies regular attendance and punctuality as 
key to overall student achievement relative to key benchmarks and measurements for student achievement. 

Analysis of data around those students who had either severe, chronic or were at risk for chronic absenteeism 
revealed that approximately 1/3 of students fell under one of these categories. The team agreed on specific strategies 
to address attendance and punctuality needs of this group that will be implemented over the year.

collaborating and supporting our plan. In early October, the principal and staff will work together to match mentors 
and mentees. Staff members will then continue to make contact with the families and set up strategies to make sure 
children are in school regularly and on time. 

Midpoint: In January 2019 families will be presented with individual and school attendance percentages and review 
the success or improvement needed of our plan. School staff members paired with families will discuss attendance 
through January’s progress report and reassess needs to be met with families. This will also be a time where teachers 
and families will discuss how individual student attendance is affecting school performance and access to the 
curriculum. We will also review attendance and ensure that children who are not paired continue to have attendance 
in good standing.  

May/June 2019: Community meeting to celebrate and congratulate all of the students who have shown improvement 
in attendance.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

After meeting with 3rd graders and their teachers, to discuss student performance and progress, concerns were raised 
around literacy skills, which new students were lacking in order to perform 3rd grade tasks. In looking at the second 
grade curriculum, teachers do expect the second graders to meet higher standards than the first graders in their 
classrooms, however they need some additional time to grasp concepts.  

 

In reading, students are found to be struggling in decoding, as assessed by TCRWP running records last year. In math, 
students are having difficulty reading the word problems, as with the common core standards, additional reading in 
math is necessary and problematic when students do not understand what is being asked of them. In first grade, 
students are struggling with the increased demands of writing more often than in kindergarten.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
Within the 2018-2019 school year, the first and second graders will receive tutoring and enrichment in phonics and 
handwriting in order to for them to increase their reading level and stamina.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Teachers will assess students’ reading levels and on-demand 
writing skills. They will be divided into small groups during 
independent reading, shared reading, guided reading, and buddy 
reading based on ability levels to tailor that work together. 
Students will be grouped based on ability to target needs. 

For second graders: We will design and implement an 
afterschool FUNdations and Great Leaps tutorial for 2nd graders 
designed to target phonetic needs of readers. 2nd graders will 
need a group for ENL support and vocabulary for learners this 
year rather than last year when there was only one ENL student. 
Math support will consist of working on word problems to meet 
the rigorous demands of the common core in preparation for 3rd 
grade. 

For first graders: When the second graders go to swim once a 
week, 1st graders will work on Words Their Way as an 
independent activity based on their individual decoding needs. 
Handwriting Without Tears will also be used to continue their 
foundation of handwriting. FUNdations will also be used as small 
target groups are created for specific phonetic needs.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

For the past 2 years, our School Implementation Team has been meeting and working on how we can improve our 
work with students with special needs and those who are struggling. The team, decided last year that we needed to 
create a protocol in order to ensure the entire school staff is aware of RTI and ENL strategies to incorporate into the 
daily routine. During our PPT time last year, we spent time discussing additional interventions to help children before 
referral. In order to intervene immediately as opposed to waiting for a PPT meeting, we feel the staff needs additional 
professional development in both RTI and ENL activities. Many special education teachers have attended and are 
attending PD offered by the NYCDOE for RTI / AIS, Literacy, and more, which will be presented to the staff.  

We will also work with a staff developer from Godmansour and Rutherford to provide coaching and strategies to 
support our special needs students and growing number of ICT teachers in the classrooms. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this

Over the past four years, we have had monthly discussions with staff and SLT to review and move forward with our 
School Technology Plan. This has been a consistent goal in our CEP. As the final leg of our technology plan, we want to 
develop a platform for teachers to collaborate and work together on curriculum planning. As the 2017-2018 test 
scores indicate, students have shown improvement in both ELA and Math.  

We will continue developing and implementing a long term plan for the use of technology in the classroom by 
children, as a tool for teachers and as a communication tool with parents. This will be measured by monitoring the 
use of Google Docs accounts created by classroom teachers and technology team during the 2018-2019 school year. 
Using the Google platform we have created as a technology team, we will exchange thoughts, curriculum maps and 
materials. This will be used not only as a shared space, but one to communicate and work together to better insure 
the success of all students.

By the end of the school year, teachers will have this Google platform space created, documents shared and revised, 
and an understanding of the knowledge each staff member can offer to better the teaching of all subject areas, in 
addition to new Promethean boards and training on using them.

We are in our seventh year of having a technology team that 
consists of two parents, five teachers, the principal, and parent 
coordinator who are very knowledgeable in technology. This 
team works collaboratively without school staff to plan, monitor, 
and seek out funding to support our technology needs. This past 
year, the team’s recommendation of including and adding an 
Early childhood technology component was accomplished. The 
team wrote and submitted a RESO A grant request for the 
purchase of a 35 laptop cart for use in the Science room. Last 
year, all outdated SMART boards were replaced by Promethean 
boards, which will last longer with LED bulbs rather than 
traditional projector bulbs. This team will continue to meet and 
plan in identifying our technology needs and resources for the 
continued implementation of our plan.  

We will use school funds to pay for a Technology Intern from 
CUNY to assist with troubleshooting, and technology 
maintenance. The principal will work closely with the technology 
team and the intern with the goal of using our resources 
effectively. 

The team will continue to work on developing our school 
website and making it user friendly. The team will also ensure 
teachers are using the Google docs and email platform in order 
to plan, collaborate, and communicate with families. 

We will seek school and/or PTA funds to provide PD for staff and 
to prioritize technology spending and to evaluate new initiative.

for each grade level cohort to us in classrooms. Each teacher has been provided an iPad to use in the classroom. We 
purchased Promethean boards for the remaining preK and K classrooms that did not have them. We have offered 
(Election Day, and a cycle of Monday PD) choices of technology workshops that are differentiated to meet the diverse 
needs of our teaching staff. Per session is paid through Tax Level funds. The tech team has planned and scheduled a 
Tech Mixer, scheduled for early September. The Tech Mixer, last year was very successful, raising both funds and 
engagement. Parents are members and an integral part of our Technology Team and planning for this work.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
The tech team meets monthly to plan and review the status of the technology plan and to make suggestions and 
adjustments. The identified benchmarks to monitor progress will take place in January 2018, March 2018, and May 
2018.  

 

September/October: Promethean boards are agreed upon and paperwork is sent for approval. We are put on the 
waiting list to get new boards installed. 

 

January: 2019 

1.  By this time, the tech team should have a date for the installation of Promethean boards. The team will also 
have evaluated the needs of the school and tailored PD to meet the staff’s needs, as all Promethean boards 
will be new for staff to learn how to use.  

2.  Staff will also be completing progress reports at this time. By using Google Docs, teachers will share reports 

with each other, particularly with teachers in the 1/2 grades with math groups and the 4th grade 
departmentalization.

March (Midpoint):  

1.  Teachers will be surveyed about the technology they may or may not be struggling with. Tech team will meet 

and discuss how to incorporate additional PD or support for teachers’ needs. 

2.  Teachers will share documents about curriculum and unit plans via the Google platform.  

May/June: Teachers will be surveyed about their understanding of the technology in the classroom, how much they 
used this year and what impact it had on their teaching and the student’s learning.  

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. 
The tech team will develop surveys for teachers to complete about technology in their classrooms and particularly 
about the Google platform. The tech team will look at the Google accounts and evaluate the usage of each teacher in 
communicating with families and with sharing, or contributing to documents.  

Teachers are surveyed and the use of technology is monitored and included in teacher lesson plans. 

Observations and notation through the use of Danielson Framework help to assess our needs and impact of 
technology on student progress and performance. 

 
Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school.The Children's Workshop School in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

The children's workshop School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA State

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
  Our school uses the TC Literacy Assessment tools as well as the assessment tools from Marie M. Clay.  These include running 
records, writing observations, Bear Inventory Spelling, and oral language observations. Others include Quantitative Reading 
Inventory. Reading Recovery Assessments, LLI and Wilsons.  .    
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
  Our program is evaluated through informal and formal assessments such as the NYSESLAT scores, running records, writing 
assessments, and Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT assements. Comparing these assessments along with the RLAT reports, ELA, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

Math and Social Studies scores, teachers and staff are informed of the successes and needs that our ELL’s are presently 
demonstrating.   
  
These assessments are maintained in an ESL student binder for the total years of services, of each student, and reviewed 
periodically with teachers and students to detemine growth in specific areas.    
  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
 Data that is collected guide teachers to plan differentitated instruction that facilitates specific areas of need.  Teachers are 
informed of similar areas of difficulties among students and create small groups for mini lessons that target those trends.      
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Accumulative data reveals the stages English learners are in and how they are processing language and meaning.  The patterns 
across proficiency levels reveal that speaking and listening is developed at a higher rate then reading and writing.   
Data also reveals that students may reach an advance level in speaking and listening but remain in a beginning level for 
reading and writing.  This data informs us of the immediate areas of need and targets specific areas for the development of 
writing and reading.  Data informs a lower proficiency in the area of writing with the upper grades (3rd - 5th).  Inquiry teams 
and study groups are focusing closely to the development of writing. 
  
  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

   The organization model for our schools consists of a Pull-Out model.  The program model is created to fit the needs 
of students according to their proficiency levels as well as their developmental stages.   
  
1b:  In our Pull-Out model, students are grouped heterogeneously when proficiencies are one level apart.  For 
example; entering with emerging , or transitioning with expanding.  Grade levels are also taken into consideration 
when grouping (kindergarteners with first graders, and second – fifth graders grouped heterogeneously).      

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

NA   

c.  DL program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

                              ELL students in entering and emerging stage receive 360 minutes of English as a  new language weekly. ELL 
students in transitioning and expanding levels of proficiency receive 180 minutes of instructional mandated time weekly.     
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
                Core content is delivered and scaffold in small groups.  ESL teacher and classroom teachers often meet to discuss 
content learning themes, skills and expectations that ENL are currently learning and participating in their classrooms.  ENL 
teacher then scaffolds and creates themes and lessons that align to the learning goals and related instructions of the 
classrooms.   
  
  
  
        Differentiation is considered for instructional planning.  ESL teacher and classroom teacher plan together to scaffold and 
provide various ways for students to participate in their regular classrooms.  Students are provided with additional support 
materials, such as pictures, access to computers and library.  Students are given an opportunity to demonstrate their learning 
using various assessment tools; presentations, verbal responses, and/or by collaborating with other students.       
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

                ELL's are not evaluated in their home languages throughout the year due to the lack of resources for languages such 
as Arabic, and Chinese.      
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a.  NA - we haven't had SIFE students in our school for several years.   
b.  Newcomer - Newcomers are often grouped with more advanced students (emerging students) to provide listening and 
speaking opportunities with others.  Prompts for common phrases, academic instructions, pictures and symbols are provided 
to students.  This collection of support is in their individual folders and accessible to the students in and out of the 
classrooms.   
c.  Developing - Developing students continue to received differentiated instruction with less prompts.  However they are 
provided with hands on and accessible support; such as folders, lists of phrases, and /or pictures that prompt both their 
speaking and writing skills.  IPAD and internet access is also available at any time when working in small groups with ENL 
teacher.  Most classrooms also provide IPAD with internet access for quick look ups (websites and apps are integrated for 
quick access on IPADs and laptops).  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Instructional strategies include but are not limited to providing opportunties for students to research, inviting students to 
share their  interest in books and themes and creating ways for students to connect prior knowledge and experience to new 
knowledge and experience. ENL teacher encourages students to connect and/or use their cultural experiences for meaningful 
understanding of new learning.  Materials that are use may stem from graphic organizer, venn diagrams, use of real objects, 
maps - these may look different every year depending on the individual profiles and needs of our ELLs.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?
