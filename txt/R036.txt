Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

problem solving. By providing a curriculum that incorporates creativity, physical fitness, scientific exploration and the 
acquisition of technology skills we promote the development of a community of lifelong learners.  

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Contextual Information About the School’s Community and its Unique/Important Characteristics 

P. S. 36R, The John C. Drumgoole School, is located in the community of Annadale on Staten Island’s south shore. We 
are situated alongside the Korean War Veteran’s Parkway. 

P.S. 36R is housed in two adjacent buildings. Our main building services Pre-kindergarten through fifth grade. Many of 
our Arts programs are located in our annex. Our total student population is 874 , including 20.71% IEP students and 
3.68% ELLs. There are currently 28 general education classes including twelve that follow the ICT model, as well as 
two 12x1x1 classes and two 12x1 class. We will offer five full-day pre-K sessions for our youngest learners for the 
2018-2019 school year. Attendance averaged 94.9% during the 2017-2018 school year. The student demographics 
include 74.57% White, 16.46% Hispanic, 7.13% Asian, 1.27% multi racial, .23% American Indian, and .23% Black. 

P.S. 36R students participate in a cluster program designed to complement and enhance classroom instruction. 
Emphasis is placed on the arts. This program provides P.S.36 students with access to the complete curriculum in visual 
and performing arts. The school program includes the following clusters: technology, physical education, youth 
development, visual arts, music, theatre arts, and dance. A band and dance program is offered to students in grades 4 
and 5 culminating in a Spring Concert. We celebrate our students' fine arts efforts through our gallery display and 
Artsonia. 

Technology instruction is designed to integrate the use of internet connected computers with classroom instruction. 
Integrated instructional activities include student created publications using Google Drive for Education via our 
@drumgooledragons.org Google G suite for Education domain. We are at the beginning stages of integrating Google 
Classrooms under our @drumgooledragons.org domain where teachers and students collaborate on collective 
curriculum based projects. Our school currently has a computer lab with 32 student workstations, 17 mobile Airbook 
laptop 32 student workstation mobile labs and two 12. laptop mobile labs for grades 3-5 12:1 classes. Grade k, 1, 2, 3, 
4, 5 and cluster program classrooms have 1 interactive white board/display connected to either a desktop or laptop 
computer. All instructional computers are connected to the Internet via the building wide network. Network printers 
are shared throughout the building by teachers and students. Use of the computers and laptops connected to the 
building wide network provides students an opportunity to access the Internet and work on research as well as 
publish projects via Google g suite and classroom simultaneously and collaboratively in their classrooms. Because 
Google G suite is online students are able to connect to their work via Google Drive and Classroom by signing in under 
the @drumgooledragons.org domain from their home or any internet connected device. With the wireless Project 
Connect initiative, students in both buildings continue to have access to the Internet. 

P.S. 36 strives to maintain partnerships with local and cultural institutions. We have implemented a variety of 
programs that involve school and community partnerships. These include Staten Island Mental Health Reading 
Volunteers, Learning Leaders Artworks and Reading, Parents As Art Partners, Girl and Boy Scouts of America and 
through our Community and Health Fair each year we include all cultural organizations and local community 
businesses and Health Related Services on Staten Island. These partnerships have offered opportunities for students 
and parents to tap their creative talents while establishing stronger bonds within families. Our school has an academic 
partnership with Teachers College in which ongoing professional development is offered in school and at Teachers 
College.

We are fully participating in the Algebra for All initiative. Teachers in grades 4 and 5 are departmentalized for ELA and 
Math instruction. Teachers of Mathematics have attended one full week of professional development in the summer, 
and attend on-going sessions throughout the school year. A consultant from national Teacher's Network (NTN) 
provides support and coaching in mathematics classrooms. 

In celebrating with our learning community, students participate in many class-based and school-wide activities 
designed to reinforce self-esteem, multiculturalism, school achievement, service and positive values. Activities include 
special assemblies which include monthly Student and Citizen of the Month Award Ceremonies, community services 
such as NYC Police Dept., NYC Fire Dept., and performances.  

We encourage parent involvement in the school through parent/child workshops including literacy, math, and 
science, after school programs, art exhibits, family Harvest Fair, School Spirit Week , family activities night, student 
concerts, fun run, Community and Health Fairs, Book Fair, Holiday Fair, etc. Parents are invited into classrooms 
throughout the year to assist their children with special classroom activities and to participate in classroom 
celebrations such as, sharing of students work e.g., writing, performances, student projects across the various 
curriculum areas including, literacy, math, social studies and science. There is a monthly parent support group for 
parents in addition to the monthly workshops in all curriculum areas. 

Our PTA parents are very active in developing activities and programs for our children and fund raising activities. In 
addition to the Parent Teacher Association we have a volunteer program for parents to help us in the classrooms 
through Learning Leaders and Parents as Arts Partners. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

21% of our student population have IEPs for special services. Of these 80% are below standards in mathematics. 

 

4% of our students are English Language Learners. ELL students' performance is similar to their peers in the school. 
Vocabulary acquisition remains the focus for their support. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

PS36 has made great progress in the past year in the element of “Supportive Environment” as outlined in the 
Framework for Great Schools. Our Youth Development program, Student Government and PBIS model establishes a 
classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. We 
have continued to build on this momentum by incorporating "The Leader in Me” which it teaches 21st century 
leadership and life skills to students and creates a culture of student empowerment based on the idea that every child 
can be a leader. Our key area of focus this year is “Effective School Leadership” in which the Principal and Assistant 
Principals will lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, by supporting impact team

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Based on classroom observations and corresponding Advance data from the 2017-2018 school year (92% of teachers 
rated effective or highly effective in domain 1, and 84% of teachers rated effective or highly effective in domain 3) and 
the fall of 2017, classroom instruction is customized incorporating formative assessments that allow teachers to 
design instruction that supports the needs of unique learners. Student groupings are identified to target needs 
revealed through such formative checkpoints and remediation/enrichment provided as appropriate. 

Based on Advance data from 2017-2018 school year, 19% of teachers were considered highly effective in 4e. As a 
result of participation in organized teacher team work, 25% of teachers will be Highly Effective in 4e.  

In response to The Framework for Great Schools, the NYC School Survey shows an increase in Rigorous instruction 
from 2.43 in school year 2016-2017 to 4.44 in school year 2017-18. Teachers will leverage this to unpack and gain a 
better understanding of the  
Common Core Standards, create curriculum maps, emphasizing the major focus of the grade. 

The most recent Quality Review from December 2017 identifies PS 36 as proficient in rigorous instruction. 

 

During the 2018-2019 school year we will focus our efforts on analyzing and unpacking mathematics Common Core 
Learning Standards to identify clear learning targets and corresponding success criteria. Data meetings will facilitate 
protocols for grade team planning sessions centered on standard analysis, state exam question deconstruction, and 
effective assessment design so that teachers may utilize a backwards design model when revising their units of study 
to target the priority standards listed, and to show improved overall student proficiency. In doing so we will reduce 
the number of students performing at level 1 and 2. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

2017 PPO Feedback indicates that there is a lack of consistent actionable feedback to students across all content 
areas and that teacher checks for understanding and providing students with assessment opportunities are not 
consistent across classrooms. 

Based on the 2017-2018 Learning Environment Survey, 69% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the teachers at 
their school take responsibility for improving the school. (Q1c).  
 
2017-2018 Advance data indicates that 88% of teachers were rated effective or highly effective in overall ratings.  
2017-2018 Advance data shows that 19% of teachers are highly effective in component 4e Professional 
Responsibilities. Teachers who are rated H.E. participate in teacher teams and initiate action research 
 
The Quality Review feedback indicates that although most teacher teams are strengthening their practice, the analysis 
of student work does not typically result in improved mastery of goals for select groups of students. Engaging in 
structured professional collaborations was named as the area of focus for the school. 
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, as a result of participation in organized teacher teams work, 25% of teachers will be Highly Effective in 
Danielson component 4e, Growing and Developing Professionally.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 36, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 
To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

  

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
Describe the direct instruction supplemental program here and include the 

rationale 

 
  subgroups and grade levels of students to be served  
  schedule and duration 
 
language of instruction 
  # and types of certified teachers 
 

types of materials  

Begin description here:            
There are currently 27 ELLs who are in the newcomer subgroup in grades K, 1, 2, and 4.  They 
are our largest group, they make up approximately 80% of our ELLs.  The remaining ELLs are 
in the developing subgroup, and are in our Special Education Program.  Of our ELLs that took 
the ELA, they were all in a Special Education Program or were in the United States for no more 
than three years.  Of our Non-ELLs, 63% scored a 3 or 4 on the ELA.  Of our ELLs, 16.7% that 
took the ELA scored a 3 or 4.  This is why we have invited our newcomers to attend our after-
school program scheduled from December 12, 2018-June 12, 2019.  The program will take place 
from 2:45-4:15.  The program will also include newcomers in grades 1-5.  The rationale for 
choosing the newcomers subgroup is because of the increasing number of newcomers, who need 
the most support.  This is why we have selected this population as our target subgroup.  In 
addition, to our students receiving assistance to promote academic progress, we will also help the 
parents of our ELLs by providing them with parent engagement opportunities.  We have 
determined that our focus will be on developing vocabulary and reading comprehension because 
reading skills are essential in being successful in all other academic content areas.  
Our Title III Program will distinguish from our daily program because we will utilize Imagine 
Learning educational materials to develop language and literacy.  Imagine Learning will provide 
our ELL students with adaptive instruction, individualized learning that starts students at their 
own level and continues to adjust to their needs and offers explicit targeted instruction.  Our 
ENL teachers will also work with our ELLs in small groups using guided instruction with 
emphasis on developing vocabulary and reading comprehension.  This program will give 
additional support to our ELLs in their home language.  There will be 2 certified ENL teachers 
working with 2 small groups in different grade bands. 
Some projects and activities we will do with our ELLs are, a multi-cultural celebration where 
each student can draw a flag of their home country, research important facts about their country, 
share a special treat from their country or bring in a book to share with their classmates about 
their culture and traditions.  The ENL teachers have selected a book to read, Throw Your Tooth 
On The Roof, by Selby B. Beeler.  This book tells about the tooth traditions from around the 
world.  We will discuss the way different cultures celebrate a child loosing a tooth.  We will 
follow-up this with an activity where they will draw a picture and write about how they celebrate 
loosing a tooth in their culture.  
We will inform our parents of our Title III After-School Program using the Language Line and 
the Translation Unit.  Parents will be  contacted using oral interpretation and written 
translation.  Letters will be sent home to our ELL parents, that requested written translation in 
their home language.  Prior to the start of our Title III Program, we would like to set up a 
meeting with the parents to explain the importance and benefits of their child attending. 
We will track our student's participation by keeping a daily attendance sheet for every day our 
ELL students are in attendance.    The ENL teachers will make copies of the attendance sheet for 
the principal and assistant principal to maintain for their records.  Linda Winthrop, our ENL 
teacher, will create a Title III binder including student's attendance, parent's attendance sheet for 
Title III meeting with agenda, along with all other pertinent information.

Begin description here:            
Professional development is provided to teachers and staff responsible for delivery of instruction 
and services to ELLs.  Our professional development focuses on diversity, targeted instruction, 
strategies and best practices to promote academic achievement in ELLs.  Our Imagine Learning 
PD will inform teachers of ELLs of the many benefits of this program, which offers instruction 
that is research based, strategically scaffolded, with differentiated instruction and support in 15 
languages.  Because we are offering a wide range of professional learning, we feel that these 
PDs will have a positive impact on the progress of our ELLs.  Our teachers will take advantage 
of professional development workshops that are offered to classroom teachers of ELLs, as well 
as, all other staff responsible for providing instruction to ELLs.  The following is a list of 
scheduled PD's which will take place during the 2018-2019 school year: 
September-June - All classroom teachers are given professional development from Teacher's 
College in the content areas of reading and writing, where strategies to assist ELL students are 
offered. 
October - ELL Systems Protocol Update Professional Development was attended by Linda 
Winthrop (ENL teacher) on October 2, 2018.  This PD was provided by Enrico Domingo, Kim 
Sievers, Teuta Ulaj and Aziz Elabida.  
October - Beyond Diversity Professional Development is provided by the Staten Island Field 
Support Center on October 10 and 11, 2018.  Our classroom teacher, Dina Bentley, will 
attend.  Ms. Bentley is our K teacher that works with Linda Winthrop, our ENL teacher, to 
provide ENL instruction for our Kindergarten ELLs.  Ms. Bentley will share with Linda 
Winthrop what she learned from the Beyond Diversity Professional Development. 
December-June - Our ENL teacher, Linda Winthrop, will provide Professional Development to 
Renata Mantzioros, our new ENL teacher, and any other staff members.  Some topics will 
include:  The ELL Identification Process, Administering the new NYSITELL, LPT,  generating 
and distributing compliance letters, ATS reports that are mandated, creating an ENL 
informational spreadsheet, Alternate Pathways, LAP, Language Translation and Interpretation 
Form, Title III, as well as ENL strategies.  
December - ENL teachers will be trained by a staff developer from Imagine Learning.  This 
training will offer our teachers professional development on how to implement new features of 
technology, from the Imagine Learning Program, that will help promote literacy growth in our 
ELLs.    
January 2019 - Imagine Learning Professional Development will be provided by Linda Winthrop 
and Renata Mantzioros to teachers that are responsible for providing ENL instruction to our 
ELLs.  The ENL teachers will discuss with the classroom teachers the Title III program, where 
our ELL students will be using Imagine Learning.  They will also discuss, reaching out to the 
parents to inform them about the benefits of their child attending our Title III Program.  
March - Developing strategies to assist ELLs in Writing.  This professional learning opportunity 
will be offered to teachers of ELLs and support staff which provides direct instruction to 
ELLs.  It will be provided by Linda Winthrop and Renata Mantzioros (ENL teachers). 
April - NYSESLAT-  Training is provided by Linda Winthrop (ENL Teacher) to the staff that is 
scoring the Speaking subtest of the NYSESLAT.

Part C: Professional Development  
May - Writing and Rubrics training is provided by Linda Winthrop (ENL Teacher) to the staff 
that is scoring the Writing subtest of the NYSESLAT.   
For professional development workshops that are attended outside our school, the teachers will 
sign an attendance sheet and their administrators will be informed of their attendance.  Teachers 
will have agenda sheets to confirm their presence along with any other materials that were 
offered at the PD.  The school (administrators) will keep a record of all teachers that attended 
PDs outside our school.  Classroom teachers will keep their own record of attendance.  For PDs 
that are provided by our school, the teachers will sign an attendance sheet, copies will be given 
to our administrators to keep for their records.  The ENL teachers will keep all agenda sheets and 
any other material they have in their ENL binder, from any PDs that they attended or 
offered.  The classroom teachers will keep their own personal records of what PDs they attended 
in their school, along with agenda sheets and any other material that was provided at the PD. 
In addition to these professional development opportunities, Linda Winthrop and 
Renata Mantzioros (ENL Teachers) will attend professional development workshops 
that are provided by the Staten Island Field Support Center.  At this time, we are unsure of which 
professional development opportunities are being offered for the 2018-2019 school year, but we 
will seek out every opportunity to improve our teaching, understanding of compliance related 
issues, and professional growth. 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities

(2018-2019) we will be offering a Title III Program to our ELLs that are newcomers.  We plan to 
reach out to our parents to keep them informed of the different activities their child will be 
involved in throughout the school year and programs that will be offered for children and adults 
within the community.

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
  
1.  At P. S. 36 one assessment tool we use to assess early literacy skills is, Teachers College Reading and Writing Project, which 
is done on an on going basis.  We assess our K-2 students in letter identification (upper and lower), sounds of the letters, high 
frequency words, spelling words, print concept, vocabulary and comprehension of fiction and non-fiction text.   For grades 3-5 
TCRWP is used to assess and monitor the progress of our students' fluency, accuracy and reading comprehension.  Teachers 
use the data to help determine where their students weaknesses are.  Instruction is then targeted to help these students to 
improve their reading and writing skills.  For the past school year, the majority of our ELL students in grades K-2 scored at 
grade level in reading,  For the school year 2017-2018, our Kindergarten ELLs scored overall at the Pre-Emerging and Early 
Emerging level in reading.  This paralleled with our NON-ELLs in the same Kindergarten class.  In grades 3-5 three students that 
are Newcomers scored a 1.43, 1.89 and a  2.90 on the ELA and 1.86 and 2.34 on the Math State Exam.  One Special Education 
student scored a 2.31 on the ELA and 2.03 on the Math State Exam.  Of our former ELLs, the lowest score was 2.09 (this 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

student transferred to our school this year from a bilingual program at her previous school).  Our remaining ELLs, scored 2.29, 
2.73, 2.81, 2.90, 3.03, 3.47 and 4.00 on the ELA,   We will use this data to target our students' areas of weaknesses.  We will 
put more emphasis on vocabulary, reading comprehension and offer Math interventions to assist students in meeting the 
grade standards.. 
 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2. Assessments will be on going throughout the school year.  The teachers will plan instruction based on analysis of student 
work and teacher reflections.  They will look at which parts of the curriculum worked well for their students and what needs to 
be fine-tuned.  Teachers will also participate in a bi-weekly data meeting with the school administration to review student 
progress toward meeting the standards, and design changes to their planning to support student achievement.  Goals will be 
customized to allow students to make progress, with emphasis put on progress and not perfection.    
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
3. Teachers will use summative assessments to evaluate student learning, knowledge, proficiency or success at the beginning 
(pre-assessment) and conclusion (post-assessment) of a unit of study.  In the past, Linda Winthrop, our ENL Teacher has 
administered to grades 3-5 the ELL Periodic Assessment to her ELL students in the fall and spring.  To assess progress we 
administer the Benchmark Assessments in December and May to give teachers feedback on how students are meeting 
academic standards.  The MOSL is also administered to all grades in ELA and Math to measure student's growth.     
  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

4. Once the summative data has been gathered, it will be determined where the students weaknesses are.  Students struggling 
with reading will be put into guided reading groups, offered double-dose of Fundations and Wilson.  Additional support  will be 
given to help these students by working in small groups, providing vocabulary support, using audio and visuals, graphic 
organizers, one-to-one tutoring and providing differentiated instruction that focuses on English language acquisition. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
  
5.  Our school closely monitors students to identify those at risk through evidence and research based instruction, assessments 
and interventions.  Tier 1: Core Instruction-rigorous evidence based curriculum with emphasis on English language 
development for ELLs.  In the beginning of the school year, students are given screening assessments:  Fundations- pre and 
post writing, assignments and TC letter identification, letter sounds, sight words and running records.  Data is gathered 
through assessments, observations and school work.  Our school offers targeted intervention to those students that are 
struggling.  The teacher offers additional instructional support to these students by working in small groups in the classroom 
with appropriate differentiated instruction.  Teachers adapt and modify instructional presentation and offer tasks to meet the 
student's learning styles.  Tier 2:  Double Dose of Instruction-The parent is notified in writing first, before supports are 
given.  In addition to the Tier 1 supports, use of supplemental programs in the classroom such as Earobics and double dose of 
Fundations, Guided Reading Groups, Push-in support from Out-of-Classroom Personnel, Wilson, Great Leaps, STARS, Daily Oral 
Language, Words Their Way, Reader's Theatre, Daily Math and Khan Academy.  For some students  “streaming” into another 
class that offers specialized supports, such as Wilson, and Focus on Fluency, etc.  Tier  3:  Intensive Instruction-  At risk services 
with intense instruction (push-in and pull out) provided by another teacher in a small group, no more than 3 students or one-
to-one tutoring or one-to-one website.  Students that do not make adequate progress after Tier 3 interventions will be 
discussed at a PPT meeting, where recommendations will be made for a possible evaluation for services.  Our teachers are in 
close contact with the parents to discuss their child's progress by having face to face meetings and conferencing over the 
phone, using the translation unit when needed.  When determining what additional supports our students need we will 
consider how many years the student has been in the ENL program, English and home language literacy, social and emotional 
support needs, teacher recommendation, parent's requests, samples of student's work, whether the student is a SIFE ELL and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

a bilingual educational evaluation, if the student has or may have a disability.   
   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
 
6.   We used the RLAT to analyze our 2017 NYSESLAT scores, which indicated that the majority of our ELLs (Grades K-5) scored 
at the Expanding and Commanding level.  Of the 22 ELLs who took the 2017 NYSESLAT, 5 tested out (Commanding 
level)  while 14 scored at the Expanding level.  One Kindergarten student scored at the Emerging level, one second grade 
special education student scored at the Transitioning level and one second grade student that entered our school in April 2017 
from Russia scored at the Entering level.  Of the Kindergarten students that were administered the NYSITELL for the school 
year 2017-2018 and tested into the ENL program, 9 students tested at the Transitioning level and 5 students scored at the 
Expanding level.  The ELA scores along with the RLAT are used to evaluate and inform our ENL teacher of those students that 
tested out.  Those students that scored a 3.00 on the ELA and Expanding on the NYSESLAT are at the Commanding level and 
are entitled to 90 minutes per week of Integrated ENL services.    
   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

7. The ENL teacher, Linda Winthrop, has shared with the classroom teachers and other school staff members the proficiency 
level of her ELL students and the mandated minutes they are required to receive via email or with a one-to-one meeting.  She 
discusses with the classroom teacher what proficiency level the child scored at on their previous NYSESLAT, compared to their 
most recent score on the NYSESLAT.  Ms. Winthrop will also share their strengths and weaknesses, as well as their family 
history.  She will obtain all necessary reports on ATS, including the RLAT to share with the school staff.        

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

1. a.  Our English as a New Language (ENL) Program provides instruction in English and support in the student's home 
language.  Our school has always adhered to the new CR Part 154-2 regulations, Stand-Alone and Integrated ENL, for 
our ELLs and former ELLs.  For our students at the Entering and Emerging level, we have always provided them with 
the mandated 2 units of study per week (360 min) with one unit of study (180 min) per week as Stand-Alone (pull-out) 
and one unit of study per week as Integrated ENL/ELA (push-in).  This will allow our ELL students to remain in their 
classroom during their literacy block in order to maximize English language acquisition.  The ENL teacher will work 
with her ELL students during content instruction in collaboration with their regular classroom teacher to provide 
English language acquisition and vocabulary support while retaining content instruction time. For our ELLs that are at 
the Transitioning and Expanding level, we have always provided them with the mandated 1 unit of study per week 
(180 min) with .5 units (90 min) of mandated ENL/ELA (push-in) instruction for the Transitioning and the remaining .5 
units of study are "Flexibile."  For our ELLs at the Expanding level we have always had our ENL teacher push-in 
(Integrated ENL) for 1 unit of study during ELA or during other content area instruction, as mandated by CR Part 154-
2.  Our former ELLs, who are at the Commanding level, will receive the mandated .5 units (90 min) per week of 
Integrated ENL/ELA or during other content area instruction for two additional years after they test out of the 
NYSESLAT.  All of our ELL students are placed together in the same classes (per grade) to allow for our ENL teacher 
to service them with the mandated  amount of minutes of Integrated ENL instruction.  Only our ELLs who are in a 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

Special Education Program are placed in a different class.  For Standalone ENL instruction, they are grouped together 
by grade (maximum grade span 2 contiguous grades for Special Education) and proficiency level (when able to) 
allowing their ENL teacher to provide differentiated instruction that focuses on English language acquisition.  The ENL 
teacher works collaboratively with the classroom teacher to ensure curricular alignment.  She will share ENL reading 
and writing strategies with these teachers so they can work together to help our ELLs acquire academic language and 
improve their reading and writing skills.  Presently, we are waiting to see if we can get an F-Status ENL teacher so that 
all of our ELL students will be serviced as mandated by CR Part 154-2, since we have many of our students at the 
Expanding and Commanding level.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           2. a.  Our ENL teacher will do an RLAT report to make sure that she is providing her students with the mandated amount 
of ENL instruction as per CR Part 154-2.  ELLs at the Entering and Emerging level have always received 2 units of study per 
week (360 min), Transitioning and Expanding ELLs have always received 1 unit of study per week and our former ELLs at the 
Commanding level have always received .5 units of study.  Our ELLs are offered HLA instructional support throughout the 
school year by encouraging them to read bilingual books, write stories in their home language, buddy them up with another 
ELL that speaks their home language, celebrate cultural events and offer bilingual instruction when needed.      
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   3.  Our ENL teacher uses the Rigby Program for our ELLs to make content comprehensible to foster language development 
and meet the demands of the CCLS.  Support is provided to our ELL students by pushing-in (Integrated ENL) during content 
area instruction.  These students are given support in English in listening, speaking, reading and writing (Whole Language 
Approach).  A variety of activities and ENL teaching methods and approaches are implemented, including read alouds, shared 
reading, guided reading, word work, TPR, Mind Mirrors, Think-Pair-Share,Talk/Think-Aloud, Quick-Write, collaborative writing, 
independent writing, guided writing, Jigsaw Vocabulary, role playing, visuals, authentic material, Realia and using 
manipulatives to develop language.  These ENL methods are used to help our ELLs meet or exceed the Common Core Learning 
Standards.  Students are encouraged to respond to literature, to express themselves verbally and in writing and to read and 
listen to stories for enjoyment.  As they are learning, our ELLs are encouraged to interact socially with their teacher and 
classmates.  Students are encouraged to use critical thinking skills during classroom discussions.  Many of the stories that are 
shared in the ENL classroom reflect the cross-cultural nature of the world around us.  Native language support is used to enrich 
comprehension.          
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

 4.  In the past, our ELLs have been evaluated, during their initial assessment, (Spanish LAB) by Ms. Montecalvo, who is 
proficient in Spanish and is one of our Pre-Kindergarten teachers.  For the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 school year, we will 
continue to use Ms. Montecalvo to administer the Spanish LAB.  When students need further evaluation, a bilingual 
psychologist who is proficient in the student's home language is used.     
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?

e. 

Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

5 a. A plan for SIFE students has been developed at our school, even though we do not presently have any students who are 
SIFE.  Since ELLs have diverse backgrounds, languages, and education profiles, it is important for us to have a plan for SIFE 
students that meet their needs.  We will use the NYSED website to obtain information, such as "Questions and Answers about 
SIFE," the SIFE Oral Interview ( which we will use to identify SIFE students), Guidance documents and the MLS, Multilingual 
Literacy Sife Screener Assessment.  Our school stays connected with parents through the PTA Newsletter, that gives parents a 
forum to address any issues that they are concerned about.   A Reading Volunteer Program, a monthly Parent Coordinator’s 
Newsletter, and our Parent to Parent Meetings offer help to families of ELLs.   We currently offer an after-school program, 
which is run by the YMCA, where students can receive assistance with homework, art, sports, and other extracurricular 
activities.  Students that are struggling will be provided with interventions that address those areas and check their progress to 
ensure they are on the right track.  We have several Special Education students that receive SETSS.  Our teachers will 
differentiate instruction for those students that have been identified as SIFE by offering double dose of Fundations, working 
with Sife students in small groups or one-to-one, using TPR, mind mirror, manipulatives, authentic material, visuals and 
gestures to give support with English language acquisition.  In addition, our ENL teacher will work closely with the 
general/special education teachers using differentiated instruction, to fit the age and abilities of our students.       
  
b.  Project Jump Start is a program that is offered to newly enrolled ELL/LEP students.  After an initial assessment is given to a 
newly enrolled ELL, the ENL teacher and Parent Coordinator reach out to these parents to offer help, which may include 
translators when needed.  Our ENL teacher offers a variation of Home Language support to our ELLs.  Bilingual books, bilingual 
dictionaries and glossaries are in the ENL classroom for students to use and read.  When possible the ENL teacher buddies a 
newcomer with another ELL student that speaks the same language.  By doing this it makes the transition period for our new 
incoming ELLs easier.  Our Parent Coordinator, Assistant Principal (ENL Coordinator), and ENL teacher have been instrumental 
in ensuring that the parents of ELLs, including new incoming ELLs, are aware of our current programs, available workshops 
after school, supplemental services and language assistance.  Parents are kept informed through our monthly newsletter, PTA 
meetings, email blast, school messages, parent workshops and school website.  Also, our instructional plan for our ELLs taking 
the ELA after one year, is to provide additional support in small group work in the classroom (Integrated ENL Instruction) and 
during ENL Stand-Alone instruction.  This will help to meet the needs of our new incoming ELLs, and offer the appropriate level 
of challenge to our ELLs.  Our ENL teacher works with her ELL students in a small group trying to push-in (Integrated ENL) the 
classroom during the literacy block for the mandated 180/360 minutes,  to maximize English language acquisition and 
vocabulary support.  This year, we will continue to have our ENL teacher try to schedule her program to meet the CR Part 154-
2 regulations, Integrated and Stand-Alone ENL Instruction.  Our ELLs will receive the 180/360 minutes they are entitled to.  This 
year, we have set up a new school website to help parents of newcomers access curriculum content and learning resources. 
  
c.  Our plan for our Developing ELLs receiving 4-6 years of ENL instruction: 
        Currently, we have only one special education ELL that is receiving ENL instruction for 4 years.  In the past, our ENL and 
classroom teachers worked with these ELLs providing extra support in developing their reading and writing skills.  Continual 
assessments have been done in the past and will continue to be done in the future by our ENL teacher, as well as the 
classroom teacher.  Specific goals and objectives in the development of language will be implemented on an individual basis 
collaboratively between the ENL and classroom teachers.  
  
d.  At the present time, we do not have any long term ELLs (6 + years) attending our school.  In the past, our SETSS teacher has 
worked with some of our long term ELLs and our ELLs with special needs, doing a push-in during content instruction in 
collaboration with the classroom teacher.  Support is provided to these students that addresses their needs and helps them to 
improve their academic performance.  She uses manipulatives and concrete material to support student learning needs. 
  
e.  We presently have 11 former ELLs that will receive the mandated .5 units of study in ENL instruction for the school year 
2017-2018.  Students in grades three, four, and five will continue to receive ELL Testing Accomodations for the next two 
years.  The classroom teacher will be notified by our ENL teacher once a student passes the NYSESLAT.  Both the ENL and 
classroom teachers will re-evaluate the student’s strengths and weaknesses, and will continually monitor for needed 
support.  Our ENL teacher will work with her former ELLs to offer transitional support when she pushes into the classroom.

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
6. All teachers review their student's IEPs and confer with related service providers to ensure that their students are receiving 
all mandated services.  To accelerate  English language development, graphic organizers are used for writing, manipulatives for 
math, ELLs are placed in guided reading groups and instruction is differentiated to meet the needs of our ELLs with 
disabilities.  Teachers will use supplemental materials and work with their ELLs in small groups differentiating instruction.  Our 
research based materials include, for reading SPIRE, Wilson and Fundations.  For math all grades use Go Math.  The 
approved instuctional materials used for writing are, Units of Study-Lucy Calkins (all grades), TCRWP, FOSS for science and 
Passport to Social Studies all grades.  Our students  have access to RAZ KIDS to help them improve their reading skills and 
maintain their reading level during the summer months.  Our ENL teacher uses the Rigby Program to work with her ELLs and 
students with disabilities.  Many of the teachers use technology to support our ELLs by using their smartboards or ENO 
boards.  Visuals, gestures, color coding, Total Physical Response, picture dictionaries, buddy two students together that speak 
the same home language, audio, technology, role playing, bilingual books and bilingual dictionaries are some of the 
instructional strategies and materials that teachers, who have ELLs and ELLs with a disability, use to provide access to content 
areas and to accelerate English language development.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
7.  Our ENL teacher will follow the new mandates of the CR Part 154-2 regulations pushing into the classroom during the 
literacy block to allow ELL-SWD the opportunity to remain in their classroom during content instruction.  This enables our 
students the opportunity to attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment.  SWD may be placed in special 
classes only when the nature or severity of the disability is such that even with the use of supplementary aids and services, 
education cannot be satisfactorily achieved.  To enable these students to achieve the IEP goals our ENL teacher works with 
these students in their classroom in a small group or individually using ENL strategies and accommodations that are 
determined necessary based on the individual child's needs. Our ENL teacher works in collaboration with the classroom 
teacher to ensure curricular alignment.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
8.  At P.S. 36 we provide AIS services in several ways.  Tier 1 interventions are services that are provided in the classroom for 
our ELLs, that are not meeting the standard, during the regular school day by the classroom teacher.  Students that do not 
make progress in Tier 1 based on screening and ongoing checks of progress are provided with additional instructional support 
in Tier 2.  Additional support is provided to these students in the subject area they are deficient in.  This may be researched 
based strategies through modified instruction, small group work, guided lessons, and guided reading groups, with 
supplemental material being used for extra reinforcement.  Classroom teachers must maintain records of the supplemental 
work being provided, (guided reading plans, conference notes, etc.).  Support services need to be reviewed after six weeks to 
determine if the type of support being given is effective.  Our Tier3 interventions are services that are given by an additional 
provider for our ELLs either through push-in, or pull out models.  These students work with their service provider during small 
group classroom instruction using appropriate materials.  Some programs used are Fundations, Wilson, Words Their Way, 
Connection for Comprehension, Great Leaps Reading, Soar to Success, STARS, Great Leaps Math, Go Math Intense 
Intervention.  One-to-one tutors for some students is provided through Learning Leaders.  "Streaming," is another 
intervention, where a student goes into another class that offers specialized supports such as Wilson, Double Dose Fundations, 
etc.  Students not making adequate progress after Tier 3 intervention will be discussed for a possible evaluation for 
services.  They will be monitored closely and their teacher will fill out a PPT referral form so that the Pupil Progress Team can 
make a recommendation.  The intervention is offered in English.    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

9. Our teachers have new units of study for teaching reading through Teacher's College.  The new units offer many supports 
through teacher resources to enhance the curriculum.  The teachers are using learning progressions to differentiate the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

instruction to find out where each child is within the standards. All classes have students on Khan Academy for math to assign 
students tasks to match appropriate learning targets.   In addition, to our After School Program, we have a "Before School 
Program"  where different activities are done by the students under the guidance of Karen Olsen, our Youth Development 
teacher.  This year, many of our teachers received new ENO and Promethian boards to use for instruction..   
      
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

10.  At P. S. 36 we have never had a Bilingual Program because we have never had enough parents request us to start a 
program.  We have a very diverse group of ELLs  at P.S. 36, with usually 11 or 12 different languages spoken among them.  In 
the past, our parents have chosen ENL as their first choice of program for their child.  For this reason we have never had the 
demand for a Bilingual Program.  If in the future, we have the numbers and parents request a Bilingual Program, we will make 
the necessary plans to start one.  
     
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
11.  Our parent coordinator informs all parents through our P.S. 36 Newsletters, P.T.A. meetings, email blast, and parent 
workshops, which are offered in the afternoon and evening, when possible.  Letters and flyers are often sent home by the ENL 
teacher (in their home language when provided) informing them of any activities and workshops.  In the past, and this school 
year, our ENL teacher has sent home flyers in the nine translated languages informing parents of meetings and conferences 
that they may wish to attend and where they may go to attend free classes to learn English .  Our ENL teacher, Linda Winthrop, 
sent home in June letters to parents, in their home language, informing them of the ELL Summer School Program.  We will 
continue to inform these parents in the future, and will use the translation unit and Language Line when necessary.  Our after 
school offerings are listed in the programs brochure and distributed to families.  Additional programs may be offered for one 
or more cycles during the year.  This year, we have the YMCA Program that some of our ELLs attend that offers them academic 
support.          
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
12.  The instructional material used in our ENL classroom is the Rigby Program.  The Rigby Program, On Our Way to English, is a 
comprehensive program for ELLs that focuses on oral language development, literacy learning, and content area 
learning.  Thematic units, guided reading collections, and phonics instruction work together to provide the language, literacy, 
and content instruction that is necessary to help ELLs have academic success.  ENL strategies are infused into content 
instruction by using a Thematic Approach, based on TESOL and content standards.  Social Studies, Science and Math are 
embedded throughout the program.  Interactive multi-sensory activities are implemented to engage students’ diverse learning 
styles.  Our ENL and classroom teachers work together using differentiated instruction to meet the needs of our ELLs at all 
stages of language acquisition and all levels of English literacy development, including those ELLs who have been in the United 
States for more than one year and will be taking the ELA.  Bilingual glossaries, dictionaries and story books are available to our 
ELL students to assist them in their ENL classroom.  Bilingual instruction when needed and reading and writing in their home 
language are some other ways we offer home language support to our ELLs.  The ENL teacher will also pair a newcomer with 
another student who shares the same home language.   
  
At P.S. 36 we realize the advantages of using technology in the classroom, especially for our ELL students.  All of our classrooms 
have access to Electronic Projectors, which allows them to see a larger version of maps, books, etc., and enables them to see 
details more clearly.  All of our third, fourth and fifth grade students, including ELLs, use their Laptops for projects and 
research.  Our third, fourth and fifth grade classes are equipped with Smart Boards and the lower grades are equipped with 
ENO Boards and Promethian boards.  Using Smart Boards and ENO Boards in the classrooms engages our ELLs by using 
interactive multi-sensory technology.  This year, our ENL teacher received a new IPAD to use for visuals when giving instruction 
to her ELL students.  
     
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

13.  Home language support is offered to our ELLs by the use of bilingual glossaries and dictionaries.  Materials and books in 
their home language are offered in the ENL classroom as well.  Our ENL teacher buddies a newcomer with another student 
that shares the same home language and advises the classroom teacher to do the same.  In the past, we have 
administered  the Math State Exam to students in their home language.  If the test wasn't offered in their home language we 
would have the Math State Exam orally translated in the student's home language.  Our ENL teacher sends home letters to the 
parents in their home language, when possible, and uses  the Language Line, when needed, to communicate with parents.  She 
has given all school staff the number of the Language Line and all needed information so that they will have access to the 
Language Line as well  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

 14.  The support services provided to our ELLs corresponds to their age and grade level.  Some of the support services we 
provide are: 
 
Grear Leaps Reading which has been implemented in second and third grades.   The program includes timed tasks 
for decoding and develops fluency. 
 
The Earobics Program has been implemented in every Kindergarten through second grade classroom.  The phonetic program 
has proven to be an excellent tool to assist in language acquisition for our ELLs, as well as for other students.    
  
Soar to Success is a literature-based program with leveled text.  The range of ability is low through high enabling students at all 
levels to participate.   
  
During the school year 2017-2018 Scholastic News, a non-fiction literature program has been used for differentiated 
instruction.  It offers grade appropriate current events, multiple reading levels and online Spanish translation.  We plan to 
continue to use Scholastic News. 
  
P.S. 36 uses Fundations for Kindergarten, first and second grade and grades three through five use Wilson.  TCRWP is used in 
all the grades.  Go Math is used for math instruction in all grades.  
    
  
Oral expression through dramatic play is encouraged in our kindergarten program.  Listening centers are implemented in our 
early childhood classrooms assisting with fluency of language.  
  
 In the past years, our SETSS teacher has pushed into our ELL classrooms working with our ELLs in small groups. 
  
For the school year 2017-2018 we will place our ELLs together by grade, wherever possible, so that the ENL teacher can push 
into the general/special education classrooms to provide instruction collaboratively with the classroom teacher.  All of the 
above mentioned learning activities should continue with an emphasis on reading and writing especially in the various content 
areas.       
   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
15.  Our school does NOT share a building (co-location). 
     
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
 16.  Project Jump Start is a program that is offered to newly enrolled ELL/LEP students.  Our school reaches out to these 
parents with our summer programs, Parent Orientations and walk throughs with our Parent Coordinator, Lilliann 
DeLuca.  After an initial assessment is given to a newly enrolled ELL, the ENL teacher introduces the Parent Coordinator to the 
parents to offer help, which may include translators when needed..  Our Parent Coordinator, ENL teacher and Assistant 
Principal have been instrumental in ensuring that the parents of ELLs, including new incoming ELLs, are aware of our current 
programs, available workshops after school programs, supplemental services and language assistance.  Parents are kept

informed through our monthly newsletter, P.T.A. meetings, email blast, school messages, school website and parent 
workshops.  Whenever available, notices are sent home in their home language.  In the past, our ENL teacher has also 
participated in an English Language Learners' Educational Forum, and has invited parents of ELLs to attend.  Parents are 
informed of any ELL Conferences throughout the year. 
    
  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

17.  In the past, we have encouraged our students to participate in our After School Program which offered beginner 
Spanish.  This allowed our students the opportunity to develop an understanding of the many different cultures surrounding 
us.   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

At this time, we don't have a Dual Language Program. 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 1.  For the past three years professional development has been offered to our teaching staff, especially targeting those 
teachers who have ELLs in their classroom.  District staff developers have had ENL workshops for many of the teachers.  Our 
ENL teacher attends many of the ENL professional development workshops.  Listings of ENL workshop offerings, current 
publications, and literature regarding English Language Learners that offer information and standards-based strategies to assist 
with developing instruction for ELLs are continually distributed to staff. Some of the PD workshops that our ENL teacher 
attended are:  Implications of the Service Deliver Model in Scheduling and Programming for ELLs (September 14, 2016), Nuts 
and Bolts of ELL Related Items (September 23, 2016), Reflective Practice Teaching Series 1 (October 19, 2016), Reflective 
Practice Teaching Series 2 (November 8, 2016), Differentiating Instruction and Assessment for ELLs (February 6, 2017), LAP 
Training (May 12, 2017), Learning Differently Amidst Diversity: A Language Deficit or Disability? (May 31, 2017), Learning 
Differently Amidst Diversity: A Continuum (June 8, 2017), and the EDAT PD that Dina Bentley (K teacher) attended with our ENL 
teacher.  In the present school year, our ENL teacher, Linda Winthrop, attending a PD on September 27, 2017 (Using 
Technology with ELLs) and she will continue to attend PDs that are offered by the Department of Education.  Our Pupil 
Accounting Secretary attended PDs pertaining to ELLs and STARS.  This year, our ENL teacher along with our IEP 
teacher presented two PDs to our staff on Translation of the IEPs.  In the past, our ENL teacher and some of our classroom 
teachers of ELLs attended ELL workshops, one was on the EDAT.  She will continue to attend ELL workshops throughout the 
year along with other teachers at our school and will look into what PDs DELL is offering. 
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 
 2.  In the past two years, our ENL teacher and our classroom teachers of ELLs attended a series of  ENL workshops on 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

Academic Literacy for ELLs Aligned to the Common Core State Standards.  Our Assistant Principal keeps a careful record of any 
general education and Special Education teachers that have completed their 15% of total hours of ELL training.  Our ENL 
teacher keeps a  binder of all PDs she attends and will meet the required mandates of CR Part 154.   Fifty percent of her total 
hours for PD will be in ENL instruction.  Our professional development plan at P. S. 36,  for all ELL personnel and classroom 
teachers is on going. 
  
     
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
1.  Parents are kept informed through our school website, monthly newsletter, P.T.A. meetings, email blast, school messages, 
and parent workshops.  Our ENL teacher informs our parents of ELLs that the Department of Education website translates into 
many different languages.  Our school prepares a packet for our parents which consists of a survey that we use to get feedback 
from them.  At our ELL Parent Orientation our ENL teacher addresses any questions that our parents have concerning their 
children and introduces our Parent Coordinator and Assistant Principal.  Parents are encouraged to contact our school with 
their concerns, where they can be advised by our Parent Coordinator, Lilliann De Luca, Assistant Principal, Stephanie Bassett, 
Principal, Barbara Bellafatto, and ENL teacher, Linda Winthrop.  At the beginning of the school year, our ENL teacher provides 
these parents with a telephone number where they can receive assistance with their child’s homework in their home 
language..  She also shows them how they can get information from the NYC Department of Education in their home language. 
Their child's progress is discussed at our Parent Teacher Conferences that are offered on any Tuesday during Parent 
Engagement.  Linda Winthrop will contact parents by phone to set up meetings throughout the school year.  Our ENL teacher 
and  all our teachers are available to meet with our parents on Tuesdays, during parent engagement, as well.  During the 
course of the school year, flyers are sent out to parents in their home language inviting them to a number of ELL Parent 
Conferences and Workshops.  To make it more convenient for our parent's of ELLs to attend we offered our parents 
transportation into Manhattan and transportation back to our school..   
  
Our ENL teacher keeps a log of the parents she meets with during the school year and what was discussed at the meeting.  She 
keeps this information in her ELL binder with all other important ELL documents.  When needed she and all classroom teachers 
use either in house translators or the Language Line for those parents that request translation..         

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

2.  At P.S. 36 we keep the parents of ELLs informed through our school website, monthly newsletter, P.T.A. meetings, email 
blast, school messages,  and parent workshops.  Parents can contact our Parent Coordinator, Lilliann DeLuca, and our ENL 
teacher, Linda Winthrop, at anytime.  Linda Winthrop will use the Translation Unit, Language Line, to communicate with 
parents and send home letters in their home language, when possible, to inform them of any ELL Conferences or meetings that 
are being held for parents of ELLs.   Parents of ELLs are invited to attend our Open School Week,  March of Dimes Walk, class 
trips and other celebrations throughout the school year.     
 

 

 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
Documentation was submitted to Enrico Domingo requesting that we will need an F-Status ENL teacher this year.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Barbara Bellafatto, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

.            All parents of our incoming students filled out a Home Language Identification Survey. In part III of the 
survey parents indicated their language preference for written and oral communication. Also, in ATS and on the 
Emergency Contact Cards the parent's language preference is indicated. When a parent indicates that they prefer 
communication in their home language, we make ever effort to accommodate them by using the Language Line 
Solutions for over-the-phone interpreters and the Translation and Interpretation Unit for written translation. We 
also have several teachers that are bilingual in our school that are available to translate as well. When our ENL 
teacher meets with her ELL parents she will ask if their language preference has changed. If it has, she will have 
them fill out a Language Preference Form. She also has Non ELL parents fill out a Language Preference Form so 
that interpretation and translation can be given to those parents that request it. She keeps copies of the HLIS and 
Language Preference Form in her ELL binder.

and Language 
Line Solutions 
for all 
meetings or

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

We will set up a language chain to call parents in the event of a school emergency. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Our school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor's Regulation A-663 and of the 
resources that are available for us to meet compliance. We will have our Language Access Coordinator, Lilliann 
DeLuca, turnkey to our staff. Our ENL teacher, Linda Winthrop, had two PDs for the 2017-2018 school year to inform 
staff of the translated templates (including the translated IEP templates) that are available on the intranet and has 
informed staff of The Language Line services and how they can be used. Our ENL teacher sends home the Bill of Rights 
and Responsibilities pamphlet and informs parents of their right to have language assistance when communicating 
with the school staff.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

. In the past school years, we have supplied our parents with the "Bill of Parent's Rights and Responsibilities" as 
required by the Chancellor's Regulations A-663, section VII. Our school has posted in a conspicuous location, near the 
primary entrance of our school, a sign in each of the covered languages, or most prominent languages indicating the 
availability of interpretation services. Our ENL teacher sends home the Language Preference Forms (to NON ELL 
parents as well) so that our parents can inform us if they need language assistance.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Our parents have filled out a school survey on-line that our school can review to gain feedback. We also have PTA 
meetings and parent workshops where parents can share their concerns. In the coming year, our ENL teacher will 
have her parents fill out a Language Preference Form (which is in several high frequency languages) and advise them 
of their rights to have translation when meeting with members of the school staff. Linda Winthrop (ENL teacher) 
informs all of the staff about the Language Line Solution services. The teachers use Language Line Solutions when 
communicating with our parents for: parent teacherconferences, parent engagement every Tuesday and whenever 
they need to speak with the parents..
