Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          6 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Public School 5 is dedicated to providing a quality instructional program in a safe and secure environment. 
Achievement levels for all students will increase through varied and challenging academic programs and assessment 
techniques that support and improve students' learning. The education of each student is a cooperative effort among 
staff, children, parents and community. Together, we will nurture social, emotional, physical and intellectual growth 
to enable our students to surpass academic standards and be caring and productive citizens involved in community 
activities.

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
PS 5 is a small school that has an enrollment of 300 students. Our community is in a residential area with middle-class 
families, many of whom are civil servants. Our population composition is 88% White, 9% Hispanic, 2% Asian, and 1% 
Black. 18% of our students are economically disadvantaged. Although a significant percentage of our students are 
economically disadvantaged, our school does not qualify for Title I funding.  

PS 5 has worked collaboratively with schools to pool our resources and develop partnerships. These collaborations 
helped support us in meeting our instructional goals despite our budgetary limitations.  

We have also partnered with Tottenville High School in several capacities. The Tottenville students volunteer to work 
with our struggling Kindergarten students and provide one on one support. In addition, Tottenville’s Junior 
Achievement Program has visited our school for two full days this year and has worked with students in every 
classroom in grades K-5. Our partnership with Tottenville has also added technology and the arts.  

 

Our teachers work collaboratively on impact teams within our school community, as well as with other school 
communities to plan and implement our school-wide instructional goals. This year we have been chosen to be a Host 
School for the Learning Partners Program.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

At PS 5, we provide strategies, supports and scaffolds for our special populations on a daily basis.  

 

We have determined that one of the greatest needs of both of our populations, Students with Disabilities and ENLs, is 
accessing materials and resources that allow them to access the curriculum. This need is addressed by the 
incorporation of technology which allows students to access texts on their reading level, texts read aloud and visual 
supports. Additionally, these same materials provide access to the Common Core standards for our ENL students.  

 

For our students with disabilities, we determined that their greatest weakness is writing. Through our formative 
assessments, we determined that their weaknesses are predominantly due to their weaker writing foundational skills. 
Their needs are addressed through small group instruction, individualized writing goals, and the use of writing 
progressions which are sometimes modified to meet their individual needs.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

During the 2017-2018 school year, the element of the Framework for Great Schools that PS 5 has made the most 
progress on is Effective School Leadership. During the course of the year, we hosted many school visits to PS 5. We 
have surpassed our goal of 5 visits. These visits included focus schools, our LPP group and other schools that were 
suggested to visit PS 5.  

 

This year our key focus will be on Rigorous Instruction. We will continue to deepen the work of Algebra for All in 
preparing our K-4 students for fifth grade.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Strengths: 

During the 2017-2018 school year, our departmentalized fifth grade has shown deep understanding of problem 
solving (86% exceeding standards in problem solving) due to their deep conceptual understanding of mathematics.  
 
Needs: 
During the 2017-2018 school year, we recognize that our students in grades 2-4 are more algorithmic rather than 
conceptual when solving mathematical problems. According to our June 2018 Instructional Report, our third and 
fourth grade students are performing on an average of only +.18 points higher than the rest of the city while our fifth 
graders are outperforming the city by an average of +.34 points higher than the city. We believe that by embedding 
algebraic thinking into math for our lower grades we will address this difference in the data.  
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  

Goal #1)  
By June of 2019, all teachers in grades 2-4 will implement conceptual teaching strategies in mathematics to 
use structures from Algebra for All early on in preparation for fifth grade A4A departmentalization model and 
deepen student understanding.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 5, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student 
Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the 
connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed 
to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of 
their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and 
Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS 5 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement 
level, e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology; 
● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning 
and decision making in support of the education of their children; 
● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support 
and monitor their child’s progress; 
● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, 
and in languages that parents can understand; 
● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to 
improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between 
parents and other members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of 
the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School 
Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their 
members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the 
implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 
● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are 
allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting 
skills; 
● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 
strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, 
the Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes 
providing technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership 
skills;  
● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  
● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, 
Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 
● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise 
parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their 
right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 
1118 and other applicable sections under the ESSA; 
● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of 
the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  
● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations 
and workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
PS 5 utilizes the DRA assessment tool to assess the early literacy skills of all students.  This assessment is done four times a 
year (September, November, March, May).  The purpose of this assessment is to provide the teacher with information on the 
ELLs phonetic and decoding skills and to provide insight to the teacher as to what reading level the students are at.  The 
assessments continue periodically throughout the school year to determine progress in reading comprehension.  Teachers use 
this quantitative data in order to better group the students in guided reading groups,  for lesson differentiation, and to guide 
instruction for their students.  The Fundations program is also used to promote phonemic awareness skills. Analaysis of DRA-2 
student data reveals that last year, across the grades, 100% of our ELLs increased by at least two reading levels.  
 
 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

This assessment is done four time a year (September, November, March, May) to document changes in each student's reading 
level.  The observations of students' reading behaviors are recorded on the Teacher Observation Guide and the DRA2 
continuum. The recorded information is used to plan further instruction. These reading behaviors have been identified in 
research as indicators of successful reading behaviors ranging from emergent to extending reading characteristics. The DRA2 is 
also available in Spanish. 
 
The DRA-2 reading assessment is done four time per year (i.e. September, November, March, and May) to document changes 
in each student's reading level.  The observations of students' reading behaviors are recorded in the Teacher Observation 
Guide and the DRA2 continuum. The recorded information is then used to plan further instruction (these reading behaviors 
have been identified in research as indicators of successful reading behaviors ranging from emergent to extending reading 
characteristics). The DRA2 is also available in Spanish. 
   
PS 5 has a data driven approach to instruction. All teachers analyze the results of various assessments to make sound 
instructional decisions for their students. We use the following assessments: Baselines, DRA-2 Reading Assessment, 
Benchmarks, Formative assessments, End-of-unit, and periodic assessments. Teachers collaborate on planning, creating 
differentiated tasks to meet specific learners' needs, vertical planning, and formulating formative assessments. Teachers are 
given time to score and analyze results to modify instruction based on student needs. Classroom teachers collaborate and plan 
regularly with the ENL teacher to discuss ELL students academic and cultural backgrounds, in addition to cultural celebrations. 
 
Within the Integrated model of language acquisition, the ENL teacher and the content teacher collaborate on the students' 
new language development to plan and make instructional decisions based on the child's needs. Collaboration among 
administration and teachers occurs weekly during data review. A variety of student work is collected and analyzed by 
administration and teachers for discussion. Established protocols for data review ensures attendance, preperation and 
participation (e.g. engaging activity at start of meeting, shared roles/responsibilities across all members). An agenda is 
established for each meeting based on input from team members from previous meetings. Updates by all members to 
enhance participation and a sense of ownership.  Furthermore, each meeting is characterized by a problemsolving process 
resulting in an action plan that stems from the overall vision and specific target goals based on ongoing review of school data. 
 
In August, NYSESLAT results are obtained from ATS using the RLAT function.  In September, the ENL teacher, along with 
administration and classroom teachers, analyze NYSESLAT results to determine student proficiency levels as well as 
their  modalities of strength and their modalities of need.  The data yielded is also used to focus on the design of effective 
instructional programs and/or interventions. Factors that are analyzed include: home language; grade level; years of ELL 
service; ELA/Math performance and progress; NYSESLAT proficiency and progress; attendance; disability classification; and 
SIFE status. We then review the data to ensure that all current and former ELL students are provided the mandated ENL 
services according to their NYSESLAT/NYSITELL results and CR Part 154. When needed, more targeted intervention is provided; 
for example, students that continue to struggle with langauge acquisition after initial screening are provided with additional 
support through small group instruction with the Orton-Gillingham Approach to teaching langauge.  
 
In analyzing NYSESLAT results, we noticed that the children who did not score commanding need to improve in the Writing 
modality. In order to improve our ELLs writing skills, students will engage in a weekly writing activity that will focus on 
developing a particular skill such as creative vocabulary use, the correct format of an essay or the peer editing process. 
 Our ENL Teacher will also utilize use the SIOP Model to design and deliver effective sheltered instruction lessons for our ELL 
students.  Furthermore, teachers will meet weekly and conduct inquiries looking at current student work and assessments. 
During this time, teachers will identify students' strengths and weakness. They will appropriately group students based on next 
steps. Teachers will also engage in intra/inter-visitations, out of school professional learning, teacher team meetings, and 
common prep time to allow for common planning, professional learning, and to foster teacher collaboration and consistency 
within classrooms. Teachers meet to plan differentiated instruction for these students based on their individual needs.  The 
needs of these students are addressed during our weekly data review periods and interventions are taken as needed.

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Our school uses the DRA-2 to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs. Based on the baseline assessment information, 100% of 
our ELL students' reading levels increased by at least two levels last year across the grades. Furthermore, the data from the 
NYS ELA Exam and the NYS Math Exam  reveals that 100% of our ELL students have scored a Level 3 on both exams. In 
addition, based on NYSESLAT data, 100% of our ELL students have made progress in the Writing modality; however, the 
Writing modality continues to be an area of need for those students not scoring Commanding on the NYSESLAT. Summative 
Writing assessments also include pre and post unit on-demand writing pieces in narrative, argumentative, and informational 
writing genres. Lastly, Math baseline and benchmark assessments are used to regularly assess student progress and areas of 
need. The formal evaluation of the ELL program's success is measured via the annual NYSESLAT which reflects the skills and 
content taught by the teacher.  Previously, the evaluation of the program's success is done informally, periodically, on a lesson 
to lesson basis, and is amended based on the ELLs comprehension of the topic, acquisition of newly taught vocabulary, and the 
ability to orally retell the main idea.  For Beginner's, retelling can be in the form of a drawing.   
 
 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Teachers meet with the instructional team and our ENL Teacher to plan differentiated instruction for these students based on 
their individual needs.  The needs of these students are addressed during our weekly data review periods and interventions 
are taken as needed.   
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
School leadership and teachers review the data of all formal and informal assessments to adequately support the academic 
needs of the ELLs in the RTI group.  Since the RTI program focuses on literacy development, ELLs receive specifically designed 
instruction focused on acquiring the literacy skills that reflect those of their peers and correlate with the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  Benchmarks and goals are set by which to measure progress.  The results of which are reviewed 
consistently and the goals adjusted accordingly.    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

During data review, teachers teams discuss the data and chart observations. The data is interpreted and discussed by the data 
team.Based on the teams observations, implications are discussed regarding classroom practice and assessments; including 
next steps, effective strategies, differentiated assignments and assessments to improve instruction and teacher practice. The 
group reflects  on the progress of the students as well as where the students should be and makes adjustments 
accordingly.  Since administration is present at all data review meetings they observe classroom instruction to see that 
adjustments are being implemented.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 

 

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Instruction for ELLs is delivered using the integrated and standalone models as mandated by CR-Part 154-2. During 
integrated ENL, the ENL teacher works with ELL students in collaboration with general education classroom teachers 
to provide language acquisition and vocabulary support. There is a common preparation time between the classroom 
and ENL teacher for collaborative lesson planning. The ENL teacher carefully plans with general education teachers to 
ensure curricular alignment and continuity of instruction. In both models, all ELL students are grouped age-
appropriately by grade and proficiency levels. Furthermore, all ELLs have access to grade-appropriate content and 
language instruction. During standalone ENL, students are grouped by proficiency levels and receive mandated ENL 
services as per CR Part 154-2.  Additionally, the ENL teacher uses knowledge of students' and their individual 
differences in order to design instruction to meet  each student's needs. Instructional groups are varied, as 
appropriate, to the different instructional goals. Learning activities are highly relevant to students and instructional 
goals. All materials and resources support the instructional goals and engage students in meaningful learning.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

  
Instruction is delivered according to the mandated number of instructional minutes based on the student's proficiency 
level.  The staff at PS 5 ensures that the ENL teacher delivers the mandated number of instructional minutes by working 
collaboratively to create an ENL schedule for the ELLs in the classroom.  Classroom libraries contain level books in the ELL 
student's native langauge for native language support as part of the NYS CR Part 154 mandate.  Instruction for students at the 
Entering level consists of 360 minutes per week.  The instructional approach and methods used at the Entering level includes:1 
period Word Work (phonics and spelling)1 period Read-aloud (listening and hands on)1 period Guided Reading (vocabulary 
and writing conventions)1 period Letters (sound, orthography, word building)2 periods Content Area Instruction (Science, 
Math, Social Studies, Health)1 period Viewing - Writing (technology based writing prompts)1 period Grammar (syntax order, 
inflectional endings, relative clauses, parts of speech, etc.)Oral language development is infused into all ENL periods. The 
instructional apprach and methods used at the Emerging level includes:1 period Word Work (phonics and spelling)1 period 
Read-aloud (listening and hands on)1 period Guided Reading (vocabulary and writing conventions)1 period Letters (sound, 
orthography, word building)2 periods Content Area Instruction (Science, Math, Social Studies, Health)1 period Viewing 
(technology based writing prompts)1 period Grammar (syntax order, inflectional endings, relative clauses, parts of speech, 
etc.)Oral language development is infused into all ENL periods. The instructional approach and methods used at the 
Advanced/Expanding level includes:1 period Vocabulary and Oral language development (phonics, spelling, definitions)1 
period Guided Reading (grammar and writing conventions)2 periods Writing and Oral language development (response to non-
fiction literature based on guided reading book in the form of essays: narrative, opinion, informational)   
 
All ELLs receive instruction as mandated by the CR Part 154, CR Part 100,and  the Language Allocation Policy.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
  
Curriculum and instruction at our school are closely aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. The ENL teacher and 
classroom teachers work collaboratively to ensure that literacy and language development are integrated with content 
instruction. We focus on increasing the academic language proficiency of all students, particularly our ELLs. Teachers of ENL 
students use the QTEL scaffolding strategies to strengthen reading and writing performance across content areas. Our ENL 
teacher uses visuals and hands on materials to support and extend our students’ academic vocabulary. Students receive core 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

content area and English language development instruction, including the use of the home/primary language as support and 
appropriate ELL instructional supports to enrich comprehension. Integrated ENL classes are co-taught by a certified content 
area teacher and a certified ENL teacher. In our Stand-alone ENL class, students receive explicit English language instruction in 
the four modalities listening, reading, writing needed for success in core content areas. Instructional approaches include 
modeling using the document camera via the SMARTBoard and Promethean Board, anchor charts, e scaffolding through 
partner work, group work, and guided practice. Specific methods used to support ELL students to meet the content demands 
of the Common Core Learning Standards include use of manipulatives, visuals, to sentence stems for speaking and 
writing,  flexible grouping, home language partnerships for turn-and-talks, targeted instruction along with partner/group work 
support ELL students to meet the content demands of the Common Core Learning Standards. The instruction for all the 
curriculum areas are adapted to meet the needs of the ELLs by pre-teaching content area vocabulary and concepts, 
incorporating thematic instruction, use of hands-on activities including manipulatives, realia, and accessing prior knowledge. A 
variety of instructional materials used to support ELLs in the core curriculum including technology, visuals, sentence frames, 
explicit vocabulary instruction, and graphic organizers. Classroom materials are modified and adapted to fit the needs of 
individual students. Newcomers use a variety of materials to help with basic language skills, including translated materials and 
native language support. Computers are used to enhance content area instruction as well as to provide access to instructional 
websites on the Internet. 
 
  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   If a translator in the child's first language is readily available, then the classroom teacher may use this staff member to either 
interpret tests orally or in writing. In some cases, the teacher may allow the ELL to demonstrate acquisition of the topic via an 
alternate method other than a written test, which do not call for translation services.  PS 5 ensures that ELLS may be 
appropriately evaluated in their native language throughout the year by permitting the ELLS to use a glossary when they feel it 
is necessary.  Parents of ELLs in testing grades are informed that all exams, except the ELA, can be administered in their native 
language if they choose.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a.  Although PS 5 does not have any SIFE students, the following plan is in place should any register throughout the school 
year:  a SIFE diagnostic ( LENS), books that are rich in print and illustration will be used.  The illustrations wills be closely related 
to the wording on each page.  These books exist in all subject areas and content areas.  SIFE students will also be instructed 
using music and poetry methods, audio supplies and visuals. A teacher modeling method and TPR will also be 
used.  Opportunities for communication will exist inin the students' exhange of communication via drawing, artwork, and TPR. 
b.  Newcomers that have been in a U.S. school less than three years are taught the CCLS and it is modified to their English 
proficiency.  Oral language, phonics and vocabulary are strongly enforced and for newcomers and reinforced in the 
classrooms.  Newcomers will be exposed using Orton-Gillingham strategies provided by a certified teacher and turn-keyed to 
classroom teachers to ensure continuity. 
c.  Developing  ELLs will be monitored closely and may be candidates for mediation such as the Response to intervention (RTI) 
model.  Orton-Gillingham strategies will be applied to the students as needed to increase and further develop their English 
skills.  The students should be assessed often to identify areas of growth and areas to be improved.  Lessons aligned to the 
CCLS build from the information they have not mastered. 
d.  Long-term ELLs need to be monitored closely and may be candidates for mediation such as the Response to intervention 
(RTI) model.  These students may be bilingually evaluated to determine if language or a disability is impeding their ability to 
reach English proficiency.  If the student has an IEP, the differentiation is based on the student’s goals.  The student should be 
assessed often and lessons should build from the information they have not mastered aligned to the CCLS within their IEP 
goals. Lessons also scaffold to support students and maintain their language strategies for reading, writing, listening, and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

speaking.  The lessons are modified for the student to better understand grade level and complex texts. 
e. ELLs that have tested out of the ENL program may continue to receive ENL instruction for up to two years after having 
tested out of the program, if requested by the ELLs parents or teacher, as a form of Academic Intervention Services.  The 
instruction for these former ELLs will be a collaborative decision between the classroom teacher and the ESL teacher in order 
to address the weaknesses he or she is demonstrating in the classroom.  The former ELLs are also alloted extra time on State 
Exams.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 
 ELLs that are also SWDs receive ENL instruction utilzing a variety of instructional materials such as realia and manipulatives for 
a more hands on approach, as well as a variety of instructional methods including TPR, SIOP lesson planning, and 
teacher  modeling.  This form of explicit systematic instruction provides access to academic content areas and accelerates 
English language development.  PS 5 teaches concepts using a concrete–pictorial–abstract learning progression to anchor 
learning in real-world, hands-on experiences. Furthermore, all students including ELLs and SWDs include the intergration of 
technology with a range of online tools including Interactive Whiteboard activities and online manipulatives.    
  
  
  
  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The use of the curricular at PS 5 for ELLS that are SWDs is the same as the NYS mandated curricular for the students' grade 
level.  Realia and other manipulatives are introduced to facilitate comprehension of the lesson at hand, as well as other 
instructional materials and methods. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
  
Our targeted intervention program is an RTI model and Orton-Gillingham.  ELA targeted intervention services include explicit 
direct instruction in small intensive groups targeted to students needs in phonics, phonemic awareness, vocabulary, fluency 
and comprehension. Supplemental intervention for ELLs focuses on phonological awareness and phonics skills.  The amount of 
time in small-group instruction and the intensity of this instruction is reflected by the degree of risk, determined by reading 
assessment data and other indicators. Furthermore, reading intervention includes the five core reading elements (phonological 
awareness, phonics, reading fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension). Targeted instruction for mathematics includes 
systematic and explicit instruction with a focus on academic vocabulary, use of manipulatives, think-alouds, peer-assisted 
learning, and ongoing monitoring of formative assessment data. All intervention programs are offered in English with native 
language support through the use of translated materials and bilingual glossarie 
s.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

P.S. 5 is using our own teacher created CCLS aligned differentiated reading curriculum and a writing continuum for English 
Language Arts and the Math in Focus program for Mathematics.  Both programs are based on CCLS, RTI, incorporate tier 1-3 
words to ensure language development and have an ELL component for lessons to better instruct ELLs. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
P.S. 5 offers equal access to all school programs to ELLs such as School-Wide Enrichment Model, Theater Arts, Ballroom 
Dancing, Zumba, science, and social studies. P.S. 5 has UAU after school which is offered to ELLS and Non ELLS.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Various instructional materials are used to support ELLs. ELLs are exposed to materials such as visual aids, glossaries, books 
aligned to their level.  The reading and writing program as well as Math in Focus have an ELL component built in for 
ELLs.  Furthermore, technology is used through Smart boards with computer based interactive lessons for literacy, math, 
science and social studies.  P.S. 5 also has a school messenger system and a school web-site that are always viable resources 
for ELLs to access school information in their native language.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support is delivered in P.S. 5’s ENL program by the use of content area glossaries, bilingual dictionaries, visual 
aids and technology.  In addition, books are provided in the student’s native language to support literacy at home. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All service providers and classroom teachers collaborate to best support out ELLs.  Often classroom teachers and service 
providers will share materials to reinforce a lesson through different points of entry.  All teachers of ELLs are aware of the age, 
grade level, and language proficiency, so they can best assist them in content area instruction and reaching language 
proficiency. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
N/A 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Newly enrolled ELL students meet with the ENL teacher at registration.  An interview is conducted and assistance is 
offered  when filling out the home language survey.  If the student is eligible for NYSITELL testing, the parent will be informed 
that their child will be tested for ENL Services  and results will be sent home with their child within the first 5 days of 
school.  During this time, parents are able to ask any questions they may have to the ENL teacher regarding their child.  A 
parent orientation meeting is also held and parents are provided with information about the school’s curriculum and 
structures. During this time resource are also provided so the students could practice the expectations of the CCLS over the 
summer. Parents of ELLs are encouraged to participate in a range of activities. They come to Curriculum Night and Open School 
Conferences. They are aware that they are eligible to join the School Leadership Team. They join the Parents’ Association. The 
parent coordinator evaluates the needs of the parents through informal discussions and by asking questions on a survey. The 
informal discussions and the responses to the survey generate which workshops will be held. The parents are interested in 
understanding the academic and social needs of the students.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The ENL teacher attends the Division of School Support and Instruction professional development meetings provided by the 
Borough Field Support offices and meetings by the office of English Language Learners when applicable.  The ENL teacher and 
the Principal attend professional development meetings and turn-key the information to classroom teachers.  This year, the 
ENL Teacher has attened the Instructional Implications of the New Service Delivery for English Language Learners 
(10/13/2015), Emerging Teacher Workshop (10/28/2015), Microsoft OneNote Training (11/3/2015), and CR Part 154.2 and .3 
Training (11/2015).  The classroom teachers will continue to attend all mandated ENL professional development hours as 
needed.  In addition, 15% of all in-house professional development will be geared toward ENL training for all teachers. 
Teachers are informed when professional development is available to teachers of ELLs.  They attend at least 15% of their 
professional development on ENL subject matter.  Professional development will all be based on the CCLS. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
All teachers are aware of the 15% of ENL training required, the principal keeps a PD log of all PD that is throughout the year 
as  well as agendas and attendance sheets. 
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
P.S. 5 will provide each parent with an annual individual meeting to discuss goals of the program, language development 
progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas.  This will be done 
during the parent involvement time that has been allotted into Tuesday afternoons.  During this time translation will be 
provided to parents based on their requested language.  Attendance sheets will be kept on file.  If a parent in unable to come 
in person a telephone conference will be conducted and the meeting will be logged in the parent engagement tracking sheet 
that is provided by the school. Translation services are made available upon request tor as needed for all parent meetings 
based on the parent’s preferred language.  A qualified interpreter or translator of the language or mode of communication the 
parent or guardian best understands, is present at each meeting. PS 5 will contact the Translation and Interpretation Unit if we 
require an interpreter for any language that is not spoken by the school staff.  
  

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
P.S. 5 provides opportunities for parents, including parents to ELLs.  P. S. 5 offers parent workshops, in areas including, but not 
limited to, early reading intervention, ELA and Math skills, unpacking the CCLS.  The Parent Coordinator meets with parents of 
ELLS to discuss parent strategies and homework. Translation services are made available upon request or as needed for all 
parent meetings based on the parent’s preferred language.  A qualified interpreter or translator of the language or mode of 
communication the parent or guardian best understands, is present at each meeting. PS 5 will contact the Translation and 
Interpretation Unit if we require an interpreter for any language that is not spoken by the school staff.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Lisa Arcuri, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

HLIS are assessed and a list is created identifying all parents’ written and oral language. This information is also 
accessed in ATS. All written forms are translated in the parents preferred language as needed. Interpreters are 
secured to make sure oral language needs are met. Teachers are aware of their students’ parents preferred 
language of communication. In addition, all emergency contact cards list parents’ written and oral language as 
well to inform all school staff if needed.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.
