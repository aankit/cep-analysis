Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Our mission statement reads as follows: 

Is 303 exists to benefit our entire student population and thereby the members of our community. The staff and 
parents of our school are committed to providing the best possible education to all of our students meeting their 
individual needs so they can succeed to the best of their abilities. We are committed to helping our students to fully 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

realize their skills and talents and to make use of them in their community and in the city, state and world beyond. Our 
students have always gone on to make us proud and we are committed to seeing that this continues. It is our firm 
belief that all students can reach their full academic and social potentials with the support of school and family – 
which in our school- form one working cohesive unit.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Herbert S. Eisenberg - I.S. 303 is an Intermediate School, servicing grades 6–8. Within our population are the following 
subgroups: ELLs, SWDs (Students with Disabilities), black and Latino males and gifted and accelerated learners. The 
school is located in the center of a multicultural community, and situated on the border of Brighton Beach and Coney 
Island. A major strength of I.S. 303 is the diverse population of students with varied cultures who speak several 
different languages. This diversity serves as the context for the development of interdisciplinary projects and 
curriculum and community celebrations. We employ strategies that empower students intellectually, socially, and 
emotionally, by using cultural associations to build knowledge, skills and dispositions. We have several programs in 
our school such as News Literacy, WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society), Financial Literacy, the Sustainability Institute, 
The Audobon Society, Arts Connection and Arts Engage that further support our vision of teachers collaborating 
together, on grade level and across contents, to find new approaches and strategies to build on their students’ 
strengths, help them bypass their weaknesses, and capitalize on their talents and interests. Arts Engage and Arts 
Connection incorporate the arts into the content area of Language Arts in the ELL and Special Needs classrooms for 
three years with the same students, from grades six through eight.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Within our population are the following subgroups: ELLs, SWDs and gifted and accelerated learners. The ELLs are in 
need grade level curriculum that can be provided to them despite the challenges they face due to their lack of 
proficiency in the language of instruction, in this case English. We have a diverse ELL population, with students of 
several different languages in addition to varied proficiency levels. Our Emerging and Entering students pose different 
needs than our expanding and transitioning ELLs. These needs range from acquiring the beginning stages of language 
acquisition to becoming fluent enough in reading and writing English to score commanding on the NYSESLAT. Arts 
Engage and Arts Connection will continue working with the ELL population to help these students, through art, 
transition smoothly and seamlessly through the stages of the second language acquisition. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The element of the Framework for Great Schools that we have made the most improvement in is Effective School 
Leadership which states that principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. We have 
been able to grow in this area due to the Leader in Me program that we began in September of 2017. This initiative 
has provided teachers and staff with the opportunity to work collaboratively as they, and students, took the lead with 
school events that fostered community and a positive learning environment for students where they can achieve and 
take ownership of their own learning. We will continue to grow with the Leader In Me Program to include additional 
components that will provide the opportunity for students to be even more responsible for their own learning. For 
example, next year we plan to have students track their own data and progress beginning with Language Arts and 
Reading. We also plan to have student led parent teacher conferences where students, based on self-assessment, will 
be able to explain their progress to their parents. Our key areas of focus for the 2018-2019 school year this year are: 
(1) To provide students, more uniformly across the school, with more actionable feedback on student work that 
contains explicit comments about strengths, weaknesses, and next steps; (2) In line with students tracking their own 
data as part of the Leader In Me initiative, we will work toward providing students with the skills they need to be able 
to self-assess and reflect upon learning and the goals that they created; (3) To improve the element of trust, 
specifically the area of promoting respect across the school community where all staff value each other and feel 
valued by others; and (4) to increase the element of rigorous Instruction, where Instruction is customized, inclusive,

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
This year we look to refine the element of rigorous instruction, where instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, 
and aligned to the Next Generation Standards and high standards are set in every classroom with students that are 
actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. After reviewing student 
portfolios, the 2018 NYS ELA scores and the NYSESLAT scores for the 2017-18 school year, we found that a 
disproportionately high percentage of students in the LEP (Limited English Proficient) subgroup performed at or below 
the median scale score between a level 2/partially proficient and a Level 3/proficient on the 2018 NYS ELA as 
compared to all the other subgroups and the general population. In addition, only a small number of ELLs scored CM 
on the 2018 NYSESLAT particularly in the sixth and seventh grades. We also found that we have a growing number of 
newcomers and SIFE (Students with Interrupted Formal Education) students that are only at an entering level; this 
year we have a total of 28 out of the 124ELLs, that are newcomers or first year ELLs at entering or emerging levels. As 
a result, we have made progress for the ELL (English Language Learners) subgroup a priority goal for the 2018 – 2019 
school year. An increase in individual student improvement via teacher-generated culminating tasks will consequently 
reduce the number of ELLs performing at levels 1 and 2. These individual gains will move these students from levels 1 
and 2 to levels 2 and 3 and move students through the various NYSESLAT levels especially in the modalities of reading 
and writing.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
1 - By June 2019, at least 75% of English Language Learners will advance at least ten points on at least two of the 
modalities as measured by the 2019 NYS NYSESLAT exam.

Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other 
high-need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-
credited, SIFE, STH). 

Weekly Math and ELA meetings, will be facilitated by 
coaches and lead teachers to provide teachers with the 
opportunity to reflect on student work and share best 
practices. During these meetings both ENL (English as a New 
Language) and content area teachers will examine student 
work, assessment results and additional student data. While 
analyzing the item skills analysis data, teachers will review 
student errors and how students can learn from their 
mistakes and what teachers can learn about their teaching 
practices from student errors. Teachers will be trained on 
how to plan instruction and form instructional groups based 
on item skills analysis and other forms of sumative and 
formative assessment. As a group, teachers will look at the 
lessons that led up to the tasks, what student 
misconceptions were made and what re-teaching, if any, 
needs to be done. Additionally, teacher comments and 
feedback to students will be actionable based upon 
individual student responses. 

The professional development team will continue to refine 
and update the existing curriculum maps to include the 
benchmark assessment pieces per unit for ELA and 
Mathematics. The assistant principal, coaches, grade leads 
and selected teachers will work together to examine and 
tailor benchmark assessments. These benchmark assessment 
pieces will be uniform across the grades and included in the 
respective portfolios. Coaches and the data specialist will 
work with teachers to train them on how to analyze the data 
from the aforementioned assessment pieces. 

 

In addition to the math and ELA assessments, iReady will be 
purchased and utilized as a base line assessment and a once-
per-week data driven resource to help improve reading 
comprehension. The iReady diagnostic exam will be 
completed for all students, including the ELLs, by the third 
week in October. Teachers will work with the lead teacher

progress will be measured in February and June. Teachers 
will also create mid-year individualized learning targets by 
Teachers will be trained on how to utilize the program and 
the data from the program to drive instruction and target 
the deficient reading skills that students have. Through this 
reflection of of student work, we will continue to refine the 
ENL curriculum maps to include the scaffolding needed to 
promote student progress. ENL teachers and content 
teachers will have weekly planning time to co-plan 
effectively to meet the demands of the integrated co-
planning model of the CR Part 154 mandate. 

Two ENL teachers will service our ENL population which will 
allow us to comply with the Part 154 mandate of servicing 
students through both stand alone and integrated teaching 
models as well as servicing those CM students. ENL teachers 
and content teachers will have weekly planning time to co-
plan effectively to meet the demands of the integrated co-
planning model of the CR Part 154 mandate. ENL teachers 
will work collaboratively to reflect and refine a curriculum 
map that incorporates, ELL standards, Next Generation 
Language Arts standards and the National Geographics and 
My Perspectives programs. To increase proficiency among 
the ELL subgroups we will work toward incorporating the ELL 
standards into all content areas while developing the 
aforementioned comprehensive curriculum map that will 
encompass the varied students’ entry levels, needs and 
specific supports. Tasks will will be refined to incorporate 
more investigation skills with a heavy emphasis on 
vocabulary and Tier II words. Teachers will review the tasks 
assigned to students using "The Cognitively Demanding Task 
Tool" and the Cognitive Rigor Matrix to ensure that students 
are challenged based on their current level. New portfolio 
menus will support the newly created tasks and programs 
will be created that support student goals and the Next 
Generation Standards. 

 

Title III and Title I programs, will be offered to target 
students based on the 2018 ELA and Math exams. These 
programs will run both after school and on weekends and 
will address students’ skill deficits. The after school programs 
will focus primarily on ELL students and address their 
language skills, math skills and the deficits they carry in each. 
The Saturday classes will focus on all students within the 
aforementioned range. Principles of Wilson, WEX and 
Framing Your Thoughts will be utilized to address student 
deficits based on data analysis of the students enrolled in the 
TItle III after school program. On the weekends we will run 
the program, "Parents and Students Learn Together" to 
improve English Language Skills for both parents and 
students to further engage parents. This program will teach

We will include two programs that infuse the Arts into ELA to 
improve the literacy of ELLs. Our school has received grants 
from both the Center for Arts Education and Arts 
Connection. This grant specifically targets the ELLs and will 
consist of one teacher and a teaching artist collaborating 
together to infuse the visual arts and ELA to increase the 
ability of ELLs to articulate and express their ideas and 
thoughts in more than just verbally and in the written form. 
The Arts Connection initiative uses theatre as the artistic 
medium to increase and offer the ELLs another way of 
expression and the Arts Engage initiative uses the visual arts.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
In line with the element of the Framework for Great Schools, Supportive Environment where the school establishes a 
classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers, we 
reviewed the 2018 NYS ELA and Math exams, we found the following: 33% of our students scored a level one in on 
the 2018 NYS Math exam and 21% of students scored a level one on the 2018 NYS ELA exam. 30% of our students 
scored a level two on the 2018 NYS math exam and 32% of our students scored a level two on the 2018 NYS ELA 
exam. Only 37% of our students scored at a Level 3 or 4 on the 2018 NYS Math exam and 47% of our students scored 
at a level 3 or 4 on the 2018 NYS ELA exam. Additionally, when reviewing data from student portfolios, iReady data, 
Reading Plus data and classroom observations for the 2017-18 school year, it has become clear that there exists a 
need to support the attainment of the CCLS, and now the Next Generation Standards, through various methods 
including scaffolding for those at-risk students, especially the ELL and SWD subgroups to ensure that all students are 
performing at the grade-appropriate CCLS/ Next Generation Standards level while simultaneously differentiating for 
those students that are at or approaching standards. After reviewing student work during common planning sessions, 
teachers expressed concerns as to how to bring those at-risk students, especially the ELL and SWD subgroups, to their 
grade appropriate Next Generation Standard while including the rigor associated with these standards. Key members 
of the SAT will provide ongoing training to teachers to help them implement key strategies and monitor progress for 
students individually and collectively.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
2 - By June 2019, 90% of students in grades 6-8 reach their individual performance targets in Math and ELA as 
measured by iReady for Math and Reading and the 2019 NYS ELA and Math Exams.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

In order meet the needs of our diverse learners in Math and ELA 
as we aim to make progress in meeting the Next Generation 
standards, we will continue to utilize the Math and ELA programs 
that we purchased for the 2016-17 schools year. Ongoing 
professional development will be provided by the coaches and 
personnel from My Perspectives, iReady and Go Math. We will 
provide training to the math and ELA teachers on how to use the 
individualized iReady lessons that target students' deficits for our 
Levels ones and twos. We will continue to refine and follow the 
revised curriculum maps and will incorporate additional texts, 
tasks and resources that are scaffolded for the different learners 
and different populations. Teachers will work together during 
the scheduled common planning periods to ensure the tasks 
created are challenging and have triangulated rubrics that can 
serve as a guide for student self and peer assessment. The 
refinement of the curricula will continue throughout the year 
prior to the onset of each unit. In ELA we continue to add 
supplemental novels and texts that are leveled for the targeted 
groups of students for each unit and create additional 
performance tasks that are scaffolded, rigorous and are aligned 
to the Next Generation standards.  

We will continue to utilize programs, such as News Literacy to 
enhance and enrich the ELA curriculum. To support growth in 
ELA and improve Reading, the iReady program will be utilized as 
Language Arts support at least once per week for all students. 
Students' reading levels will be assessed in September, 
November, February and lastly in June. This program will foster 
gains in comprehension, but will promote student awareness of 
current news topics that are cross content and actionable. 
Through the News Literacy curriculum, at the end of the cycle, 
students will research ways they can take action and become 
activists by writing to local politicians and / or raising awareness 
by starting a movement geared toward community change. 
Additionally, the programs iReady, Framing Your Thoughts and 
principles of Wilson will be utilized to help those targeted 
students that are identified as being three grade levels or more 
below their current grade in reading and / or writing. Through

the fundamentals of writing. The ENL, SETSS and Speech teachers 
will work with the targeted groups with components of the 
Wilson program which is a highly structured remedial program 
that will provide students with a systemic and cumulative 
approach to teach total word structure for total encoding and 
decoding. Students that will be identified for this program will be 
students that scored below a level on the ELA exam and have 
been identified by the ENL or ELA teacher as being at least three 
grade levels below their respective grade level. Framing Your 
Thoughts, Teachers' College Writers' Workshop, writing tasks 
from My Perspectives and WEX will be implemented together to 
promote stamina in writing while simultaneously teaching 
written language sequentially and systematically. This instruction 
will move students from basic sentence writing through 
paragraph development and comprehension. 

Level one students receive at risk service that include, at-risk ICT 
or integrated classrooms, at-risk, pull-out SETSS services, small 
groups instruction utilizing programs such as the Rewards 
program. Our students at levels ones and twos are also 
encouraged to attend our after school program and our Saturday 
program.  

We will continue to provide professional development for 
teachers in Universal Design for Learning and looking at current 
data to scaffold and differentiate for the various students’ entry 
points to ensure access to content and required benchmark tasks 
to support student learning to meet grade-appropriate Next 
Generation standards. Scaffolding will be geared toward building 
a foundation for those struggling subgoups while differentiating 
will be geared toward both the struggling students and the gifted 
learners. The ELLs receive pull-out and integrated teaching 
models dependent upon their respective NYSESLAT levels as per 
the CR 154 mandate. This small group instruction allows the 
teachers (ENL and content) focus on student deficits. During 
instruction, depending on the objective of the lesson, students 
are grouped by NYSELAT level, skill deficits or reading levels. This 
allows the teacher(s) to provide students with the necessary 
scaffolds that will bridge the gap of the deficits while allowing 
students to access the grade-appropriate standards. In addition, 
ELLs are highly encouraged to attend our TItle three after school 
and Saturday programs. These programs are taught by the ENL 
and content area teachers to reinforce the concepts during the 
day with a focus on the skills necessary for second language 
acquisition. 

In Social Studies and Science, we will continue to develop and 
refine the performance tasks while aligning our work to the NYS 
Scope and Sequence and incorporating initiatives like the Center 
for Arts Engage and Vision Maker. For the ENL curriculum, we 
will continue to utilize the National Geographic program to 
supplement and create a close alignment to the content area 
curricula which will be reflected in the pacing calendar and 
curriculum map to ensure proper support is implemented in

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In line with the Collaborative Teacher element of the Framework for Great Schools where teachers are committed to 
the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools and have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement, we reviewed the different programs, 
mandates and mandated programs and how the students in these programs perform on the various teacher - created 
writing tasks that are part of our ELA curriculum. Upon review of the arts engage and arts connection programs that 
had been implemented in our school through language arts this past school year, it became evident that students that 
are not at grade level are able to express themselves more when the output is not only in the form of writing. We also 
found, through portfolio writing pieces, ELA MOSL assessments and NYSESLAT scores that student writing is below 
standards for many of our students, particularly those ENL and SWD students. Of our 124 ELLs, 36 are at the 
expanding level and 27 are at the transitioning level. 100% of these students scored lowest on the writing modality of 
the NYSESLAT. If these students showed significant gains in the writing modality, they would be able to score 
commanding. 82% of our SWDs, although gains have been seen on the ELA MOSL performance tasks and teacher 
generated tasks, are still at a level 2 or lower. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
3 - By June 2019, teacher collaboration on developing and implementing units of study that incorporate the arts, 
particularly ifor the the ELLs and SWDs, will result in at least 80% of students improving at least one level of writing 
proficiency as evidenced by the My Perspectives unit writing tasks.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Professional development will be given to teachers, while placing 
an emphasis on how to provide students with specific and 
actionable feedback on student drafts, in all content areas. 
Feedback is most effective when it is given immediately, 
therefore teachers will also be trained on how to effectively 
weave assessment in instruction into lesson planning and how to 
hold effective conferences with students. There will be a gradual 
release to students as we shift to an increased emphasis on 
student self-assessment. Teachers will train students to reflect 
on their own writing and engage in self-assessment and peer 
revisions, and teacher conferences. During weekly common 
planning periods that are embedded into the school day for 
content area teachers, the ELA leads on each grade and assistant 
principal will provide training and resources on utilizing 
assessment in instruction that compliment My Perspectives and 
Expeditionary Learning. The resources provided by 
WeTeachNYC.org will continue to be utilized as a tool to foster 
proficiency amongst teachers in utilizing assessment in 
instruction.  

The administration and coaches will provide teachers with 
professional development on scaffolding, differentiating and UDL 
so that all students can have access to the curriculum and 
students can build to their grade appropriate standards. 
Professional development sessions will also focus on working 
collaboratively and building trust and accountability amongst the 
collaborating teachers for ENL teachers, special needs teachers 
and general education teachers. The collaboration between 
content teachers and teaching artists includes creating and 
reviewing both the ELA curriculum maps and the theatre / art 
goals for the duration of the program. Teachers meet and plan 
on how to infuse the art goals into the ELA standards and skills 
that are being taught through the trade book for each unit. We 
have also created a lesson plan template that promotes both 
teachers to detail their specific roles for each lesson through the 
different components of the lesson and how each teacher will be 
instrumental in providing students with the necessary scaffolds 
and supports.

We will also train all teachers on how to use the same practices 
and scaffolds across the different content areas so students can 
be successful in all content areas. In addition, the Arts 
Connection teaching artist and Language specialist collaborate 
with the ELA supervisor to provide training to the teachers of 
ELLs and SWDs that are identified for the grant. These trainings 
focus on the special needs of the ELL and SWD student and what 
strategies can be used to promote student participation and 
increased writing, even in the beginning language states. The ENL 
and SWD Language arts teachers in grades 6, 7 & 8 will meet 
weekly with the teaching artists from the Arts Connection and in 
the latter part of the year, CAE (The Center for Arts Education) to 
co-plan and infuse the arts into the lesson plans so that both 
content and art standards are taught during these lessons. The 
teaching artists and content area teachers work collaboratively 
to plan lessons that result in students writing original scripts, 
that will later be performed by students. Student groups use 
iPads, graphic organizers, sentence frames and writing outlines 
to support and scaffold them in the writing process. These 
collaborative lessons are scaffolded and differentiated for all of 
our students' needs, with an emphasis on scaffolding for ELLs 
and SWDs. This year, these grants will infuse the arts into ELA 
instruction to aid students in oral and eventually written 
expression. The supervisor will review lesson plans and give 
feedback to ensure that there is an equal balance of content and 
the arts. 

Teachers and teaching artists will engage families through parent 
teacher conferences and an art exhibition for parents. Teachers 
will utilize Parent Engagement sessions to share student progress 
updates with parents. Parent Teacher conferences will be 
student led and another opportunity for parents to be made 
aware of student progress. The math coach will present to 
parents during PTA meetings on how to access and utilize 
programs at home to help with coursework.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In line with the element of Effective School Leadership from the Framework for Great Schools where principals lead 
by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and 
social-emotional support that drives student achievement, we reviewed the impact that the first year of the 
implementation of the Leader In Me had on both staff members and students through focused school walk-throughs, 
informal and formal classroom observation and the Leader in Me survey. In addition, upon reviewing past Quality 
Review data and and informal and formal teacher observations for the 2016-2017 and 2017-18 school year and 
student portfolios, it has become clear that there exists a need to support teachers’ use of assessment in instruction 
in order to promote more genuine student understanding, critical thinking and growth on performance tasks. We 
have found that on the seventh grade, students underperformed in math, and as a result we have identified the 
seventh grade math teachers and students as the focus of targeted supervision, feedback and goal-setting and 
tracking. the Student portfolio reviews and informal and formal observations have further shown that students do not 
engage enough in self assessment and reflection of their own work as described in the Danielson Framework (3d). 
Peer editing does not occur consistently across classrooms nor do formalized group roles, where there is an 
assessment piece for students built in.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
 

By June 2019, through targeted support, supervision and feedback of seventh grade math teachers by school leaders, 
90% of seventh grade students scoring a level 1 or 2 will improve their proficiency in mathematics by at least .5 as 
measured by the 2019 NYS Math Exam.

Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

The mathematics curriculum has been refined to include the 
scaffolding and differentiation needed to provide all students 
with access to the grade level curriculum being taught. The 
Mathematical practices are interwoven into the curriculum and 
the math coach continues to train teachers on how to seamlessly 
integrate the appropriate mathematical practices into daily 
lessons. Teachers will also be trained on using the Cognitive 
Rigor Matrix Tool to assess the rigor in the tasks and problems 
that are assigned to students. 

Teachers of mathematics on the sixth grade will be given an 
additional period of mathematics to focus on students' deficits. 
Teachers will be equipped and trained with differentiated and 
different approaches to teach the topics that are Next 

Generation standards aligned as they progress through the 
curriculum map. Teachers will also be trained by both the data 
specialist and the math coach on how to utilize the item skills 
analysis to target the individual needs, deficits and create 
learning targets for those students that are between the ranges 
of 1.5-1.9, 2.5-2.9 2019 NYS Math exam. In addition students on 
every grade level and taking the Go Math assessment in 
Mathematics at strategic points in the year to assess a baseline, 
progress and deficits as we get closer to the date of the NYS 
Math exam. Teachers will be trained how to read the test results 
and examine the item skills analysis of the Go Math baseline 
assessment and how to utilize the site to assign differentiated 
and targeted work to students. We have purchased the iReady 
online program to be used this year with students. We will begin 
the program in September by administering a baseline 
assessment and through the data obtained, teachers will be able 
to individualize instruction and target student deficits. We will 
also administer an iReady MOY and EOY to assess student 
readiness and progress. The program will be utilized with 
students once per week in the classroom and at home as well. A 
review of the 2017-18 math teachers began at the end of last 
year and is reflected in the school's organization. Two new 
teachers, licensed in mathematics, have been hired and are now 
teaching on the eighth grade. The administrative team, including 
the math coach, will create a plan where each classroom is

with the Math coach on data and how to use it in the classroom. 
Classroom visits and training sessions will be logged for each 
teacher and progress will be checked bimonthly through the 
Danielson portal. At the beginning of the year, the administrative 
team and math coach will review the Danielson ratings of last 
year's math teachers, particularly in the seventh grade. 

In September of 2017, we rolled out the Leader in Me initiative 
to students. During the 2017-18 school year, staff members were 
provided with an additional two days of professional 
development which focused more on the implementation of the 
Leader in Me program into student learning. This year staff 
members were able form lighthouse teams that synergized to 
produce school events and guide students to taking more of the 
lead in regard to these events. The Lighthouse teams steered the 
students as we moved forward in year one of the 
implementation of the Leader in Me· A common school wide 
understanding will be adopted. Social -emotional learning is the 
ability to understand, manage, and express the social and 
emotional aspects of one’s life in ways that enable the successful 
management of students' own learning and ability to self assess. 
This year we plan to move forward with students tracking their 
own goals and the data to support those goals. We will also 
implement student-led conferences beginning with the second 
parent-teacher conference of the year. We will begin with the 
seventh grade math classes as a pilot. Once students' individual 
learning targets are established, each student will track his / her 
progress in mathematics.  

The Leader in Me initiative will continue to be shared with 
students and their parents to develop the language of the The 
Leader in Me through PTA meetings and other workshops. We 
will offer workshops to parents during the Tuesday parent 
engagement time allocation and PTA meetings. Parents who 
attend the workshops will be offered a Parent Guide and our 
Parent’s Guide is designed to help them and their children learn 
the 7 Habits at home. We want to show them that as parents, 
they can teach these lessons and activities in a fun way while 
spending time with their children. In addition, we will promote 
students taking more responsibility for their own learning and 
progress.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In line with the element of Strong Family and Community Ties from The Framework for Great Schools where the 
school creates a welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic 
life of the school, we reviewed the student report card data for the 2017-18 and 2018-19 school years. We found that 
a large number of students had failing grades in their courses, especially in the seventh and eighth grades. 
Additionally we found that students that were absent over ten days in the school year and had chronic lateness, had a 
higher frequency of failing courses. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
5 - By June 2019, 80% of targeted students will achieve grades of 75% of higher in the four core subject areas all as 
evidenced by student portfolios, Skedula (the online grading system) and quarterly report cards.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

The administration and coaches will provide teachers with 
professional development on scaffolding and differentiating so 
that all students can have access to the curriculum and students 
can build to their grade appropriate standards. Professional 
development sessions will also focus on working collaboratively 
and building trust and accountability amongst the collaborating 
teachers for ENL teachers, special needs teachers and general 
education teachers. We will also train all teachers on how to use 
the same practices and scaffolds across the different content 
areas so students can be successful in all content areas. We will 
continue to work with teachers on reading, interpreting and 
analyzing data to drive instruction and craft differentiated lesson 
plans. Analyzing the data of baseline and benchmark 
assessments will allow teachers, coaches and administration to 
identify those students that are at risk of failing courses due to 
deficits.  

Teachers and administration will work to increase parent 
involvement in order to keep parents informed about the 
importance of attendance and how it impacts students scores 
and performance. We plan to incorporate the use of an 
electronic attendance system where students have to swipe an 
electronic card and will be marked present or late. Parent 
communication and involvement will be further strengthened by 
the culminating unit events that will be planned throughout the 
school year. Parents and staff will come together to celebrate 
student successes within the different units. Our student 
achievement committee is working this year toward celebrating 
two students from each class that have shown improvement and 
made progress. Beginning with the November PTA meeting, we 
will celebrate a "Student of the Month" for those students that 
have shown improvement in homework, school work and good 
attendance. We invite parents to these events and use this as an 
opportunity to inform parents of the multiple opportunities that

the school leadership team and / or the school's PTA. Through 
parent outreach, we plan to increase the number of parent 
involvement at our PTA meetings by 10%. During these sessions 
our teachers, coaches and support staff will provide training for 
parents on how to use the tools to help their children become 
successful with our new programs, how to use online grading 
systems so parents can continually be aware of their child's 
progress and how to promote positive mental health in our 
students. In addition, parents and teachers will be trained on 
Datacations, which is the online parent communication system 
that we purchased last year and will continue to use for the 
2018-19 school year. All teachers will be asked to update their 
content-specific website with their child's homework, progress 
and attendance. We will also specify the importance of 
attendance and provide those students that have perfect 
attendance and / or improved attendance for the month awards 
during the PTA meeting.  

Our data specialist will generate student lists for those students 
that failed one or more courses for the previous year (2017-18) 
in seventh grade for eighth graders and those students that 
failed one or more subjects in the sixth grade for current seventh 
graders. She will also generate student lists of those students 
that were absent for ten or more days. This group of students 
will serve as our target group and in addition to the regular 
outreach, the parents of these students will be targeted so that 
they are invited to special events during the day and after school 
that will focus on helping these parents to meet the needs of the 
needs of these students. By October 31, 2018 we will identify 
and target all of the students in the eighth grade that scored 
below a 70 in any of the core subjects. In addition, celebratory 
events will be held for these targeted students that show 
improvement.  

We will continue to provide training for teachers on how to 
utilize Skedula /Datacations to increase parent communication, 
track student progress and behavior and calculate student 
grades. We will provide training for teachers in September and 
again at the end of October (during the end of the first marking 
quarter). In the IS 303 teacher handbook, teachers are reminded 
of the importance of updating daily student assignments, 
students grades, missing assignments and attendance into 
Skedula. The grading policy will be entered into Skedula in order 
to ensure that the grading policy is consistent across all content 
areas. Teachers will receive training on how they can use Skedula 
and Excel to formulate student grades that are aligned to the 
school's grading policy. All parents will be given their log-in 
information for Skedula during the September back to school 
night.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. IS 303, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary 
and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

IS 303 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events;

activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand. 

 

 

 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

IS 303, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is 
implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between 
the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, 
agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

   IS 303 will provide ELL and their families with a "Parents and Students Learn Together" on 
Saturdays.  This program is intended to improve English Language Skills for both parents and 
students and further engage parents.  The family literacy course is offered to parents and their 
children on Saturdays starting in late October of 2018 for approximately 28 sessions and will be 
taught by our licensed ENL teacher.  This course supports our Title III population to reinforce 
the students in our Title III programs and is  funded by  Title 1 and Title III Immigrant.  The 
group of 20-30 parents and 15-20 students in grades 6, 7 & 8  who will engage in real world 
scenarios while using Wilson strategies to refine and improve their language skills and learn 
about different strategies they can use to assist their children and support their child's academic 
and social growth.   The ENL teacher works on providing adult and student participants with a 
basic language skill yet while  utilizing different real-world scenarios  and addressing how 
parents can support what their children are doing and learning in the classroom.   The goals of 
this program include: (1)encouraging greater participation from our parents of ELLs, who 
traditionally do not participate in school programs and / or workshops due to their lack of 
confidence in their English language skills, despite our efforts to offer translation services; (2) 
To provide activities using ENL strategies to support and enhance English Language acquisition; 
and (3) To provide scaffolding for ENL students, grouped by NYSESLAT levels, in ELA and 
Math.  Home-language is supported by sending school letters home in the students' native 
language about the program, their child's ELL status and how they can support their child's 
learning in school.  The ENL teachers and content teachers use translation services when 
necessary via the phone translator of Google translator for written correspondence. We would 
also like to support and strengthen the home-school connection for our ENL students and provide 
these students and their families with opportunities and programs that will support their literacy 
and language development.  As a culminating project the participants of this program will see a 
TBD Broadway play with transportation included.This culminating project will be funded by 
Title I and Title III Immigrant and supports language acquisition through real-world scenarios, 
including the plot and story line of the TBD play.  The tentative date for this culminating activity 
is TBD date in June of 2018.   
The aforementioned program will run on Saturdays from 9:00am to 12:00pm beginning in late 
October through mid-June. 
We will also offer an after-school program for our ELLs  in grades 6, 7 & 8 who need extra 
support.  This program is offered to all of the ELLs.  Permission slips for the Wednesday / 
Thursday after school and Saturday after school programs are given to all parents.  We have the 
capability to run two different classes. The combination of the after school and Saturday 
programs allows for all of the students to take part in these programs. This program will run 
from October 26, 2018 through June 22, 2019 on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:30 - 
4:30pm.  Instruction will focus on early language skills and language acquisition.  Students will 
be grouped according to NYSESLAT levels and special attention will be given to those students 
who are newcomers and SIFE students.  These students will be grouped separately and instructed 
using the principles of Wilson and WEX.  Additionally students will be grouped based on their 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

 

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
Math levels  for one hour of each session and the content teacher will work collaboratively with 
the ENL teacher to deliver math instruction.   
The materials for both programs are supplemented and will be purchased with Title I and Title 
III.  The materials that will be utilized for this program are different than those being utilized 
during the school day.  School records will be maintained, including student attendance, by the 
classroom teacher and family assistant.  Attendance will be taken daily and kept on file with the 
ENL teacher.  The families of students that are absent from the program will be called by the 
family worker using the translation services when necessary.

supervisor.  Professional development will focus on effective strategies for teaching language 
instruction as well as research-based literacy strategies that will further strengthen students' and 
parents' literacy skills in English.  Additionally, weekly meetings and planning sessions will be 
provided for ENL teachers and their collaborating co-teachers where the curriculum maps will be 
refined to best serve the current student population.  Professional development for this program 
is at no cost to the program.  Records of professional development will be maintained by agendas

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our school currently uses  The ELL Periodic Assessment, New York City Performance Tasks, NYSESLAT or NYSITELL, 
Scantron and teacher generated assessments to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs. The results of these exams show 
that the newcomers who are "entering" are non-readers of English.  The long term ELLs and those ELLs that are entering but 
not new-comers, score 3 to 5 levels below their grade levels in reading.  Driven by this data,  we have implemented reading 
strategies that build upon phonemic awareness, encoding and decoding skills for these groups of students.  Components of 
Wilson and Orton Gillingham are being used to provide these students with the foundations needed in phonics and decoding, 
as part of AIS for these students. The principal conducts weekly training sessions with  the ENL teacher,  Speech teacher and 
ELL supervisor in the Wilson principles.  These teachers then work collaboratively to utilize these Wilson principles with these 
targeted groups of students based on the aforementioned data.  The majority of our ELL population fall in the Expanding Level, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

as gauged by the 2017 NYSESLAT.  The additional assessment tools listed above show that these students are one to two years 
below their current grade levels in reading. These students, as well as our Transitional leveled students, who are performing at 
or near grade level, are provided with leveled texts and leveled articles,  as one way to provide the scaffolding 
needed.  Components of the WEX program are also utilized to promote stamina in writing and improve writing skills as the 
majority of ELLs, regardless of proficiency level, score lower in the writing modality of the NYSESLAT than on the other three 
modalities.  This year we are incorporating components of Framing My Thoughts by Project Read which is a multi-sensory, 
structured approach that helps students master the structure of simple, complete and compound sentences.  It incorporates 
symbols for different parts of the sentence which makes abstract concepts more concrete.  Through this program, students are 
able to manipulate various parts of their sentences using the symbols to expand on their sentences and thoughts.  As a way to 
increase proficiency in writing, this program targets paragraph and essay structure for student writing.     
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Weekly common planning periods are built into the  ELA and ENL teachers' programs.   In addition, as previously mentioned, 
the ENL teachers, Speech teacher and Assistant Principal  are trained weekly by the principal on programs that address the 
encoding and decoding needs of ELLs that are low-level readers.   
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Indicators of progress for our ELLs are closely monitored through focus walks, analysis of student work during common 
planning periods,  student portfolios and feedback from teachers, parents and students. Additionally, the LAP and Core Inquiry 
Teams review periodic assessment results, NYSESLAT, ELA and Math State Exam scores and the related item skills 
analysis.  Teachers, led by a lead teacher on each grade review the ELA and Math item skills analysis to identify areas in 
need.  We have also incorporated an online program this year, called Reading Plus.  This program identifies students' reading 
grade level and we are able to target those students that are performing at grade reading levels of grade three and below.  For 
example, our RTI teacher meets twice per week with a group of sixth and seventh grade ELLs to use the REWARDS program 
with these students to improve reading levels.  Areas in need include decoding, comprehension and central idea.    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The weekly scheduled planning meetings and Monday professional development meetings are utilized not only to review the 
data but to also plan for remediation and provide intervention.  Teachers work on scaffolding and differentiating lesson 
plans.  They also revise pacing calendars to include intensive instruction on those skills that students are lacking.  In addition, 
weekly School Assessment Team meetings are held where the school's key stake holders review those students that are falling 
far below standards.  When needed, these students are sent to at risk services with either the SETSS teacher or the Speech 
teacher.  The progress of these students is reviewed monthly. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
n/a   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Examination of the data from the 2017 NYSESLAT AND NYSITELL reveal that across the grades and levels, the majority of the 
students scored significantly lower in writing than the other modalities; most students scored an average of 10 points lower on 
the writing than they did on the reading.  On average, students scored highest on the speaking and received similar scores on 
reading and listening.  Additionally, most students across the grades and levels show an increase in their scores in all 
modalities except for the writing modality.  Overall, our students show growth in reading, writing and listening as they move 
through grades 6-8 with more students at the Transitioning and Expanding levels and the majority of our students score at the 
Expanding level.  However, even the students that score at the Expanding level still score low on the writing modality.   In 
addition, this year we have Entering students that are newcomers, particularly in grade 7. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

 

The programmer meets with the ENL teachers  and the data specialist in the beginning of the year to review all students' levels 
and ensure that each ELL is programmed according to their respective level as outlined by the CR Part 154 mandate.  In 
addition, ENL teachers meet regularly with content area teachers. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Our school’s ENL program has two stand alone classes taught by two ENL teachers who hold   ENL licenses.  The ELLs 
are grouped based on their grade levels and differentiated for based on their NYSESLAT levels.  The sixth grade 
students meet with one ENL teacher and travels together as a grade.  The sixth grade students are grouped 
heterogeneously.  The seventh and eighth grade students that receive stand alone ENL services, are seen by 
another  ENL teacher and are grouped heterogeneously but differentiation is provided for them based on their 
NYSESLAT level.   grades seven and eight are grouped together so that students can be in classes of stand alone 
ENL.     
To accommodate the integrated model, ELL students are grouped together within a homeroom by grade but 
heterogeneously by NYSESLAT levels.   Because of this grouping, the ENL teacher is able to co-teach with the language 
arts teacher on grades seven and eight.  In grade six, we have an ENL teacher that is also a common branch teacher 
who teaches students the core subjects and infuses the ELL standards into the Language Arts curriculum and 
standards.  This teacher also provides the integrated ELL services for the other sixth grade students that require 
integrated services for up to 180 minutes.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           A teacher program is generated in the beginning of the year for the ENL teacher which is inclusive of the entire ELL 
population.  Entering and Emerging ELLs are serviced 360 minutes per week, Transitioning and Expanding ELLS are serviced 180 
minutes per week and Commanding ELLs are serviced 90 minutes per week.   Students are grouped by grade and level. The 
aforementioned instructional times are the New York State-mandated ENL/ELA allotted instructional times based on student 
proficiency levels.  The program consists of a “block” of ENL instruction, by grade.  All levels receive instruction together during 
the 180 minutes Integrated ENL while Entering and Emerging students receive stand alone instruction for an additional 180 
minutes.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Teachers are trained on incorporating Universal Design for Learning strategies to scaffold instruction in the different content 
areas, including Math, English Language Arts, Science and Social Studies.  This scaffolding allows students to meet the 
demands of the Common Core Learning Standards at their grade levels which beginning at students entry levels.   For example, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

in each grade the ELLs are exposed to the reading texts from both the Expeditionary Learning and My Perspectives programs 
that we use which are mapped out on our curriculum maps.  The teachers provide access to these complex texts, by front 
loading vocabulary, chunking and providing visuals for example.  The ENL teacher is able to utilize texts at individual student 
levels due to the articulation between the general education teacher and / or the special education teacher and the ENL 
teacher. 
  
Both the core subject teachers and ENL teachers differentiate instruction based on various forms of data, including the 
number of years of ELL service and reading and math levels as assessed via Reading Plus, Scantron, teacher - generated exams, 
DRA assessments and student-teacher conferences.   
  
All ELLs have access to a variety of genre through a school library and leveled classroom libraries.  Students and teachers 
regularly practice the “Seven Habits of Good Readers”.  In addition to books rich in text, the ENL libraries have a multitude of 
picture books in different genre including picture books in the different content areas and languages.  In addition to the ENL 
standards, with the embedded tasks, English As A Second Language literary Instructional Guide (Grades 6-8) is one of the ENL 
teacher's resource guides.  This guide provides teachers with scripted lesson that serve as a springboard for the collaborative 
planning sessions shared between the ENL teacher and the content area teacher.  The ENL teachers work collaboratively to 
plan lessons that use authentic reading materials to spark the writing process.  Writing is based on reading materials; for 
example; many collaborative lessons focus on memoir writing that grows out of read alouds.  The implementation of an 
articulation log serves to track articulation and collaboration among the ENL  and grade teachers.   
  
ELLs  are placed in mainstream classrooms that consist of ELL students (grouped by NYSESLAT scores), English Proficient 
students and a common branch teacher.  In addition to articulating with the ENL teacher, the classroom teacher (literacy 
teacher) utilizes many ENL methodologies in the mainstream classroom.  The classroom teacher maintains a leveled classroom 
library equipped with picture books in various genre, easy novels and content area picture books.  Classrooms (mainstream 
and ELLs) contain word-walls and labels for every day materials in order to immerse the ELL student in the English language. 
Content area teachers provide sheltered instruction to students which ensures they are exposed to standards-based, grade 
appropriate work.  In alignment with sheltered instruction and UDL, content area teachers provide this instruction through 
mutli-media presentations, including videos, pictures and audio.  Teachers also provide students the opportunity to work in 
groups where content is discussed and socialization practices allow the content to be more accessible.  In this way, English 
proficiency and content are acquired simultaneously. 
  
Our assistant principal facilitates articulation between the ENL teacher and the sixth, seventh and eighth grade literacy 
teachers regularly.  Articulation focuses on curriculum and pacing in various content areas and reinforcing reading and writing 
skills for the week..  The ENL teacher focuses on the same skill as the literacy teacher but teachers the skills at different levels 
for purposes of differentiated instruction.  Many of our ELL students practice the respective skill through elementary skill 
packets that are picture based.  Teachers also articulate common practices in the classroom such as the workshop model 
where academic rigor is made accessible in the ESL and mainstream classroom.  The articulation and collaboration between 
classroom and ENL teachers provides for improved English language development and assists the ENL teacher in providing 
content area instruction to ELLs.  
  
ELLs are given access to native language libraries, when available and leveled libraries that match their performance and 
reading levels.  Books on tape are also available to ELLs.  In addition, translation dictionaries and glossaries are available during 
all instructional periods, including content area instruction.   
  
We have incorporated the program, Reading Plus which is an online program designed to target students at their current 
reading levels and provide them with leveled texts that will build upon the skill set they need at their current reading 
levels.  The use of this program enables ELA teachers to deliver individualized instruction to students as texts are automatically 
modified to reflect each student’s reading level so all students may participate in classroom assignments about the same text 
on his or her own level.  Students are able to participate in assignments both in class and at home via the internet.  All 
classrooms are now equipped with Smart Boards and document cameras to provide ELLs with video clips, pictures and 
additional visuals that support and scaffold lessons for the ELL population.  Additionally laptop carts are utilized for additional 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

access for all students, especially the ELLs, to alternative programs and resources that are instrumental in second language 
acquisition.    
  
In addition, during the Integrated instructional time, when programmed, the ENL teacher plans and teaches collaboratively 
with content area teachers.    This collaborative teaching approach is embedded into the program when the classroom teacher 
is involved in lesson planning with the ELL teacher.  In this way, articulation between the two is optimized and serves to 
enhance the learning in both the subject-area and the ENL classroom.      
  
  
  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   ELLs are tested throughout the year with ELL testing accommodations in place in all classrooms.  These accommodations 
include native language glossaries, extended time and tests in students' native languages when available.  Periodic 
assessments, which are benchmark pieces, and standardized exams are administered in students' native languages when 
available.  Teachers also use Google translator when possible to administer exams in students' native language.  Teacher 
translators in Russian, Spanish and Arabic are utilized when needed.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Differentiated instructional strategies for SIFE students and Newcomers include acting out scenarios, sequence writing and 
occupational skills including cutting and pasting to create story sequences.  In addition, SIFE and Newcomers are part of a 
"buddy system" where the SIFE student or Newcomer is paired with a students (preferably) with the same native language 
that can help the student adjust to the  procedures, scheduling and class work.  The differentiation for these students, which is 
most predominant during students' work periods, also includes an increased focus on phonemic awareness, letter names and 
sounds, demonstrations and hands on activities.  Most recently this phonetically based mutli-sensory approach has led to 
grouping our ELLs and helping them acquire proficiency. 
  
Differentiation for ELLs receiving four to six years of service includes activating prior knowledge, allowing students to work 
with less teacher direction where the work period is more student-centered and constructivist in nature.  Students have the 
opportunity to view presentations via Smartboard, utilize computers and other manipulatives.  Articulation with the Language 
Arts teachers allows for students to read texts at their respective guided reading levels and focus in on the writing skills that 
particular students are in need of improving. 
  
Instruction for long-term ELLs focuses on test-taking strategies in addition to focusing on the specific skills pertaining to the 
different NYSESLAT modalities that students may be deficient in.  Some of the strategies utilized are effective note taking, pre-
reading, the use of dictionaries to support definitions derived from inference skills and visualizing the text.   
  
Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE) require special attention.  Our school provides these students with 
extended individualized attention through after school programs in order to bridge the gap of instructional time lost.  The ENL 
classes conducted after school meet two times per week.  The sessions last approximately two hours and students are 
instructed in  small homogeneous settings. The three classes consist of Entering and Emerging, Transitioning and Expanding 
ELL learners.  These after-school sessions focus on language skills, reading and writing skills and mathematics.   
  
Another group of ELLs that require special attention are Long Term ELL students.  This year we have two Long Term ELLs both 
of whom are students with IEPs.  In addition to differentiating and scaffolding based on classroom and standardized 
assessments, these students' IEPs are reviewed and instruction is additionally differentiated based on the student's IEP. Long 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

term ELLs also receive AIS strategies which include after school tutoring and Title III Saturday programs.   
  
Students that have recently tested out of ENL (one or two years after testing proficient) are generally placed in a classroom 
with current ELLs, when possible.  This allows these former ELLs to continue to be exposed to ESL strategies that content area 
teachers are utilizing in the classroom.  Additionally, former ELLs (up to two years) are given the testing accommodations 
mandated by the state for standardized and classroom exams.  Portfolios are also kept for these students to track their 
progress and ensure that they are meeting standards.  Additionally, the ENL teacher articulates with content area teachers 
weekly provides integrated teaching to these students 90 minutes per week in the different core content areas. 
  
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Students are provided with services and supports that are appropriate to their current age levels and their assessed 
educational levels.  However, students that have displayed a need for modified instructional or emotional support, or have 
IEPs are given services based upon his or her individual IEP goals. 
      
Teachers in all subjects follow the NYC scope and sequence for Science and Social Studies and the core curriculum for ELA and 
Mathematics along with the new programs, Go Math, My Perspectives, Teacher College and Expeditionary Learning.  Teachers 
utilize differentiated and leveled grade-appropriate texts with the ELL-SWDs.  In addition, instruction is highly scaffolded for 
this population.  Teachers, having been trained in UDL and differentiation, utilize different support texts based on student 
individual reading levels, mutli - media, graphic organizers, individualized glossaries and native language glossaries.   
  
ELL-SWDs receive all services mandated as per their IEPs through  individualized programs that are created for 
students.  Facilitated by an administrator, the School Assessment Team collaborates with the special needs teacher to create a 
program where related services, including ENL services can be provided to each student with minimal disruption to the regular 
class program. 
  
ELL-SWDs whose IEP mandates bilingual instruction are provided with an alternative language placement paraprofessional.  All 
ELL-SWDs are provided with the appropriate number of ENL units as student programs are tailored to the individual.  Students 
either receive ENL instruction during language arts or other content areas, based on the students' NYSESLAT levels, or are 
pulled our for stand alone ENL instruction during minor subjects.  As with all SWDs in our school, IEPs are reviewed by the IEP 
teacher, the special education supervisor and the school assessment team to ensure that all ELL-SWDs receive all services 
mandated on their respective IEPs. 
  
In addition to all the services required by the Individual Instructional Plans, we provide students with literacy and numeracy 
support  in after school programs.  
  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The school's curricula is designed in such a way where texts (in Language Arts) and tasks are scaffolded and differentiated to 
access all students' entry points.  Additionally both general education and special needs teachers have been trained in 
differentiating and scaffolding to meet the needs of these students to meet their IEP goals.  The School Assessment Team, 
along with the ENL and SWD teachers, review students' progress via state exams, periodic assessments and portfolios.  The 
teachers review IEP goals and complete period progress reports for these students.  When students demonstrate growth in a 
particular subject area, those students are placed in a less restrictive program for that subject as part of the Special Education 
Reform.  Flexible scheduling has been implemented for those SWDs/ELLs that have shown growth in the special education 
classroom.  These students continue to be serviced as per the appropriate ENL mandates with general education students 
where possible. The general education teacher and SWD teacher then articulate so the general education teacher is aware of 
the student's IEP goals and the general education teacher is provided with additional professional development to include 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

scaffolding strategies for this student if needed.  These students are tracked and discussed during weekly SAT team 
meetings.  During annual reviews, as is done for all SWDs, the special education teacher meets with the SAT and the parent to 
review if the student is in fact in the LRE to meet his / her instructional needs. 
  
  
  
  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Targeted intervention programs for ELLs identified as students with disabilities as well as for ELLs in ELA, math and other 
content areas include: 
Long-Term ELL Sub-Group: 
             At-risk SETTS services    
             At-risk speech                   
ELLs that are SWDs: 
Counseling / At-risk counseling 
             Phonics -based program for Emerging and Long Term ELLs during an additional literacy period 
             An additional period of Mathematics per week by the content area teacher 
             Two additional periods per week of ELA support  
Expanding ELLs That Are at a Third Grade Reading Level 
Rewards Program with the SETTS teacher 
 
All ELLs: 
After-school Saturday programs 
  
 
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

This year we are incorporating components of Framing My Thoughts by Project Read which is a multisensory, structured 
approach that helps students master the structure of simple, complete and compound sentences.  It incorporates symbols for 
different parts of the sentence which makes abstract concepts more concrete.  Through this program, students are able to 
manipulate various parts of their sentences using the symbols to expand on their sentences and thoughts.  As a way to 
increase proficiency in writing, this program targets paragraph and essay structure for student writing.    The ENL teacher will 
also be using the National Geographic Program to support the ELL and ELA common core standards during stand alone ENL 
instruction. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

n/a Never had a bilingual program. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Title I and Title III programs are available to all ELLs, regardless of performance level.  Title III programs take place after school 
on Wednesdays and Thursdays and Saturday mornings.  Title III instruction focuses primarily on re-enforcing basic literacy and 
numeracy skills that are necessary for ELLs to be successful in a mainstream classroom.  All ELLs are also invited to attend our 
NIA after school program which includes a homework help portion as well as non-academic activities that support students' 
second language acquisition through activities that incorporate listening, speaking, reading and writing of English.

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Smartboards and laptop carts have been purchased and are used to scaffold and enrich ENL instruction as well as content area 
instruction for all ENL students.  We use Expeditionary Learning and Engage NY as the base for ENL instruction in Language Arts 
and Mathematics.  This material is modified and scaffolded to help ELLs meet grade standards.  Our school currently uses 
Achieve 3000, a software based differentiated instructional software, electronic glossaries and audiobooks to provide 
instruction to ELLs.   
      
ELLs now have the opportunity to take part in our News Literacy program, which helps create an awareness of current events 
and an awareness of the manipulation that can sometimes occur through the media.  Through this program, used in 
conjunction with Achieve, Teen Tribune and the centerfornewsliteracy.com, students are able to read articles on their 
respective levels and have the opportunity to be immersed in genuine conversations based on text as well as pictures and 
video clips. 
   
  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In the program that we have, ENL (stand alone and integrated), Native language support is delivered by utilizing the Buddy-
System for students that speak the same language.  When possible, we pair students of higher and lower proficiency levels to 
aid the lower level student while simultaneously supporting the native language for both students.  Additionally, native 
classroom libraries are available in the ELL classroom and content area classrooms.  Students are supplied with glossaries in 
native languages that can be utilized in all of their content areas.  Students also have access to the internet and laptops which 
they use as a resource for transactions and information in their native languages as well.     
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Through Title I and Title III funding, we are able to provide students after school remediation with the support needed to 
provide additional support.  Title III programs takes place after school on Wednesdays and Thursdays and Saturday 
mornings.  Title III instruction focuses primarily on re-enforcing basic literacy and numeracy skills that are necessary for ELLs to 
be successful in a mainstream classroom.  Additionally we use a wide array of resources from teacher-made materials to 
hands-on materials and laptops and internet. 
    
  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We are a co-located campus and share the campus with a high school and charter school.  The co-location does not effect 
instruction.  All schools have their own classrooms, services and materials.   The campus' key stakeholders meet monthly to 
ensure that these spaces (cafe, gym, auditorium) are used equitably. 
  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
ELLs that are enrolled before the school year are invited, along with their parents, to an orientation that is held at the end of 
June.  If students are registered after this time, they are invited along with their parents to an orientation held in September to 
introduce them to our school, the programs offered in our school and specifically to our ELLs. We inform parents of the special 
after school programs that we have tailored to ELLs, the adult ENL program offered to our parents and provide parents with an 
overview of our ENL program and how they can support their ENL child at home. During this orientation,  parents are given 
lists of books to read based on reading levels.  Summer literacy and math packets are distributed to all students in all 
grades.  These packets are designed to re-enforce literacy and numeracy skills and encourage parent-student interaction. 
One of the ENL teachers works with the parent coordinator to recruit parents of the ELLs to our English Language class on 
Saturdays for ELL parents and children.  During these sessions, parents are informed on ways they can help their children with

the work in class and we also inform them of the upcoming school events.  In addition, during our monthly PTA / SLT meetings, 
we provide translators for parents to facilitate their understanding of the very important content at these meetings that helps 
parents prepare their children for the important events throughout the school year.  The guidance counselor works with our 
eighth grade ELLs to assist them with the  
  
     
  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

ELLs are offered the opportunity to have Spanish as an additional language.    
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Intensive professional development has been provided for all teachers who service ELL students, as well as Assistant principals, 
content area teachers, paraprofessionals, guidance counselors, common branches teachers, special education teachers, school 
psychologists, secretaries, parent coordinators and providers of related services.  These professional development sessions 
include immersing students in language in the different content areas and helping students with the listening and speaking 
modalities.  Both the classroom teacher and pull-out ENL teacher have received training in the Common Core Standards, lesson 
planning, Collaborative teaching, best ENL strategies, and incorporating these practices and strategies into the ENL and 
mainstream classrooms.  Weekly meetings are held with content area teachers, including the language arts teacher,  the math 
teacher and ENL teacher during the school day.  These weekly meetings focus on aligning instruction in all content areas to the 
Common-Core curricula and tailoring and scaffolding our school's programs in these content area to ELL instruction.  The 
common core standards have been unwrapped to uncover the skills that students need to attain their grade level 
standards.  Weekly skills are mapped out onto a pacing calendar and teachers are trained on using the workshop model to 
craft lesson plans that are differentiated and  provide access to all students, especially the ELLs.   Additional professional 
development is provided for ENL teachers during the Monday Professional Learning Communities and our Tuesday Inquiry 
groups.  For the first part of the year, the professional development will revolve around the new CR Part 154 mandates and 
collaborative teaching.   
Teachers have been trained on how to incorporate ELA standards into ENL lesson planning and the ENL curriculum.  ENL 
teachers have been trained in unwrapping the standards of the core curriculum.  All teachers, including the ENL teachers, have 
been trained on the structure of the reading and writing workshop using a workshop model approach to classroom teaching of 
reading and writing and in UDL to scaffold instruction for ELLs and ELLs with disabilities to help students meet 
standards.  Teachers have been shown how mini-lessons are created out of student work and how these mini-lessons should 
be utilized in the workshop model classroom.  Professional development has also been given on the importance of and the 
resources available to provide a real - world multi-media and sensory motivation to all lessons.  The components of the ELL 
classroom have been a focus of the professional development conducted in order to ensure that classrooms are print-rich 
environments for all ELL students.  A primary goal of the professional development among ENL teachers has been the 
implementation of Bloom’s Taxonomy in the ENL classroom.  Teachers have been provided with the tools needed to engage in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

 

scaffolding, to elicit critical thinking skills amongst the students, and to provide students with numerous opportunities to 
engage in academic rigor and accountable talk.  Professional development for the ELL teacher includes weekly meetings; these 
weekly meetings are held on Mondays and involve two separate 44 minute sections: one session focuses on delivering 
phonics-based instruction for beginning ELLs while the other PD section focuses on tailoring and scaffolding the core 
curriculum for ENL students in addition to 85 minutes of professional learning communities where teachers work 
collaboratively and a weekly 40 minute inquiry period where teacher conduct analysis of student work and assessments in 
order to improve instruction.   
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Our school schedule is reflective of elementary school in that students remain in the same classroom for their content area 
subjects.  This promotes a safer environment especially for those students that are not familiar with the English Language and 
risk not understanding where and how they would have to travel in a new environment.  We also provide staff with 
professional development on including parents in the educational process by using Datacations as a way to communicate with 
parents in their preferred language.     
 We provide a minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional development hours for all teachers as prescribed 
by CR Part 80 that are dedicated to language acquisition during Monday Professional Learning Opportunities and Chancellor 
Conference Days.  The ENL teacher and supervisor provide these professional development sessions.  We include a focus on 
best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English language learners.   We 
also provide a minimum of fifty percent of the required professional development hours for our ENL teacher in ENL.  We 
dedicate this time to language acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices 
for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English language learners.  This is done through 
our weekly ELA and Math planning periods where the curriculum and student work is reviewed, inquiry meetings where 
teachers focus on best practices and scaffolding for ELLs and Monday Professional Learning Opportunities.   
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
In addition to parent-teacher conferences, initial parent orientations, our ENL teacher meets individually with the parents or 
guardians of English language learners at least once per year.  During these meetings, the goals of the program, their child's 
language development needs in all content areas and their language proficiency results are discussed.  The teacher will 
schedule to meet with two parents per week during the parent engagement time to ensure that all parents are met with at 
least once per year.    
During the individual, annual parent meetings, the teacher reviews student progress by examining student work Begins with 
where the child began where they are now and how far they are from their grade appropriate standards.  The goal is to make 
meaning out of what is being taught in the classroom.  The teacher also reviews the NYSESLAT levels of the students with the 
parents and explains what they are capable of doing depending upon their stage of language acquisition.   

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parents are strongly encouraged to be active participants in their child’s education.  We offer a Saturday English Language 
Acquisition classes for the parents of ELLs where parents are taught English that can be used in real world situations and ways 
in which this language acquisition can help them become more involved in their child's education and their resepctive school 
community.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Carmen Amador, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Members of the LAP review the HLIS, Student Emergency Contact cards, and RHLA of newly admitted students to 
the Department of Education as as well as our incoming sixth grade ELLs. The pupil personnel secretary and the 
ENL teacher will keep record of these languages and inform the homeroom and subject teachers of these 
language needs, so that they provide families with materials in the requested native languages. 
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

We have both Messenger and Skedula. Both of these services translate recorded/robotic calls and will be sent to 
parents in their home languages in a timely manner. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

The Translation and Interpretation Unit will provide periodic training to parent coordinators and other key school-
based personnel, including all teachers, on the language access requirements contained in this regulation and on 
resources available to support these requirements. Training will take place on Tuesday September 4, 2018 and to be 
determined Monday dates. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

In order to comply with Chancellor's Regulations A-663 (Translations); we have posted the Welcome Poster in our 
main office and posted the Language ID Guide at the security desk and main office; posted and sent home the 
Parents' Bill of Rights in the Parent Coordinator's office in Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, Russian, Spanish, French and Urdu. 
In the beginning of the school year, we provide parents with written notification in their native languages of their 
rights regarding translation and interpretation services. Our Parent Coordinator, along with our PTA president, will 
work to ensure that letters are distributed to all parents. These rights are also posted in the school, on the parent 
bulletin board in the lobby, the parent information board in the main office, and in the guidance and parent 
coordinator offices. Our school safety plan explains the procedures in which the school safety officer, at the school's 
entrance, will adhere to in order to ensure the parents' needs of language access services are met and they are not 
prevented from reaching the school's administration. Any languages that we don't have covered will be translated by 
the Translation and Interpretation Unit.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

The staff actively seeks and encourages feedback from parents and guardians on an on-going basis. In addition, the 
annual school survey seeks quantifiable feedback regarding parents/guardians experience with the ease of 
communication within our school community. Further, the ENL teacher will send home a survey asking parents for 
feedback on the quality and availability of services.
