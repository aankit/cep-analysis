Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement?

differentiated and multi-cultural learning environment where problem solving and decision-making are fostered and 
independent thinking is required. We believe that we are creating the future leaders of society. 

Our Vision  

We believe that students learn best when teachers model, differentiate, and act as facilitators as students engage in 
rich discussions through the use of accountable talk.  

Our Instructional Focus 

LITERACY: Our school wide instructional focus is to increase student achievement by emphasizing the importance of 
literacy, with a focus on independent reading. Students will read deeply and widely from a broad range of texts 
across content areas to demonstrate their abilities to think critically, to question and analyze texts, and make their 
thinking visible through writing and student led discussions. Our instructional focus will be anchored in effective 
leadership, rigorous instruction and best practices, strong family community ties, and a wide range of enrichment 
opportunities to create optimal learning conditions and promote equity and access for all. 

MATHEMATICS: Our school wide instructional focus is to increase student achievement by emphasizing the 
importance of mathematical thinking and problem solving through active student engagement, questioning and 
mathematical discourse.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Public School 71/MS 71 is a community-based learning organization located in the Pelham Bay section of the Bronx. It 
serves approximately 1,600 students from grades K through 8. Our classes are heterogeneously grouped, and made 
up of general education students, special education students, and English as a New Language students (ENLs), which 
reflect the diverse population of the community. The student demographics are: 8% Asian, 5% Black, 62% Hispanic,

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The school has exceeded their target for student progress as indicated on the School Quality Snapshot Report. Various 
data sources have been used to support the school in making key instructional decisions. One challenge that the 
school faces is to ensure that all groups of students improve, not solely focusing on the lowest third or subgroups. 
Students who score proficient on the NYS ELA and Math exams need enrichment, as well as challenging and rigorous 
curriculum to maintain and push them to the next level. Students performing at proficiency rates in ELA was 44.6 % in 
2018 compared to 38.5 % in 2017. Students performing at proficiency rates in Math was 43.4 % in 2018 compared to 
38.6% in 2017. Key areas of focus for the 2018-2019 school year is to increase the proficiency rates in both ELA and 
Math.  

During the 2017-2018 school year, our ENL students made significant progress in ELA. ELA data for ENL students 
reflects a decrease in level 1s from 68.3% to 60.5%. The proficiency level for ENL students in ELA increased from 
31.7% to 39.4%. In math, ENL students who scored a level 1 went from 42.3% in 2016 to 48.5% in 2017. Proficiency 
rates for ENL students in mathematics went from 57.7% in 2016 to 51.6% in 2017.  

For the 2018-2019 school year, our focus will be to provide targeted AIS instruction for students in grades 3-8 during 
the school day and through after-school programs. We will continue to implement a co-teach ENL model with 
additional push-in support in mathematics and ELA.  

Our Instructional Focus 

LITERACY: Our school wide instructional focus is to increase student achievement by emphasizing the importance of 
literacy, with a focus on independent reading. Students will read deeply and widely from a broad range of texts across 
content areas to demonstrate their abilities to think critically, to question and analyze texts, and make their thinking 
visible through writing and student led discussions. Our instructional focus will be anchored in effective leadership, 
rigorous instruction and best practices, strong family community ties, and a wide range of enrichment opportunities 
to create optimal learning conditions and promote equity and access for all. 

MATHEMATICS: Our school wide instructional focus is to increase student achievement by emphasizing the 
importance of mathematical thinking and problem solving through active student engagement, questioning and 
mathematical discourse.  

For the 2018-2019 school year an area of focus from the School Quality Snapshot Guide will be to increase strong 
family-community ties.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

1. Teacher teams (inquiry) will meet bi-weekly to examine 
student data and adjust instructional practices, with a particular 
focus on mathematics. Teacher teams consist of teachers on 
each grade or departments. The facilitator of teacher team 
meetings is rotated throughout the 6 week cycle. Math coaches 
and an National Training Network (NTN) consultant are assigned 
to work alongside teacher teams. (SOP 3.3) 

2. Professional learning opportunities will be offered from Key 
Elements to Mathematics Success (KEMS). All mathematics 
teachers from grades 3-8 will be implementing the KEMS 
program with NTN supports. Grades K-5 will also have 
professional learning opportunities to implement the new 
Envision Mathematics program as a supplement to KEMS. (SOP 
3.2, 3.5) 

3. Teacher teams will meet during and after school to develop 
and enhance the math curriculum for grades K-8. The focus will 
be on the inclusion of multiple entry points to address diverse 
learners. In addition, we will partner with three neighborhood 
middle schools to support the development of curriculum maps 
and analyze student work using module assessment data. (SOP 
3.2, 3.4) 

4. Parents will be invited regularly throughout the school year to 
share in math related activities and workshops to help support 
their children at home. Students will have opportunities to 
discuss, reflect and present their mathematical competencies. 
On parent empowerment days, (Together on Tuesdays) parents 
will continue to be offered the opportunity to attend and 
participate in Math workshops: An overview of KEMS, The Five 
Practices in Mathematics, Math Problem Solving Strategies: 
SOLVE, and Family Algebra for All Night. The aforementioned 
Math Workshops will enable parents to access and better 
understand the rigorous instruction and the CCLS. (SOP 3.5)

According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide under Collaborative Teachers, 65% of teachers responded positively 
to Innovation and Collective Responsibility. This is below city average and is between the "bottom of range" and 
"approaching target" range. Based on teacher responses, our school met the target in the areas of: Cultural 
awareness and inclusive classroom instruction, Quality of professional development, School commitment, and Peer 
collaboration.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Based on the 2017 Advance data, there is still a need for ongoing support with component 3B (Using questioning and 
discussion techniques) of the Danielson's Framework. Looking at the last 2 year's Advance data, there has been an 
upward trajectory in this area of the Danielson's Framework. In addition, based on the NYSED School Report Card, 
there has been an improvement in proficiency levels in both ELA and in Math. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, on average teachers will improve 5% percentage points on their ratings of Danielson component 3b in 
Advance from 3.25-3.5 MOTP scores, as a result of timely, meaningful, and actionable feedback and coaching. This will 
increase student achievement because students will have more opportunities to develop their higher order thinking 
skills and be engaged in literacy and mathematical discourse.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS/MS71 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS/MS71 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand;

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;

described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA;

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

PS/MS71 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is 
implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between 
the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, 
agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for 
improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure

funds in the following ways: 

● Maintaining classroom positions to improve achievement for all students. 

● Collaboration with the School Leadership Team and Parents’ Association to maintain classroom positions to ensure 
achievement for all students. 

● Communication through monthly newsletters and other materials sent out to families that are pertinent to 
planning, implementation and outcomes.

PS/MS 71 currently serves 206 ELLs and former ELLs in an integrated ENL program.  Students 
come from multiple languages- for example, Spanish, Chinese, Albanian, Urdu, Greek, Arabic, 
and Bengali.  25 are Entering, 31 are Emerging, 44 Transitioning, 87 Expanding, and 14 are 
Commanding.  
  
We are projecting that approximately 150 ELLs will be receiving services on Saturdays and 
after-school to help them attain English proficiency while meeting state academic achievement 
standards.  The rationale for this program is that most of these students will be required to take 
the State ELA, Math, and Science exams.  In addition, they are required to reach common core 
standards in Social Studies.  Therefore, they need additional support in expressive language, 
visual and audio aides, phonics, reading comprehension strategies and writing skills.  They also 
need additional help with word problems and scientific terms.  Three certified ENL teachers 
teachers will provide direct instruction to ELLs for 2 hours each Saturday from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. 
beginning November 2018 and ending March 2019.  The after-school instruction will be 
delivered by three ENL certified teachers and two common branch teachers.  The after-school 
program will be offered on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:45 to 3:45 p.m for a total of 48 
sessions.  Four teachers will provide direct instruction to ELLs.  Professional Development will 
be offered twice a month from 3:45 p.m. to 4:15 p.m on Thursdays.  The after-school program 
will be extended until May  2019. 
  
For Saturday sessions, we will use Santillana's Spotlight on English textbook, workbook, and 
assessment book.  We will also use Teacher Created Materials, Spin!:  Grammar, Vocabulary, 
and Writing, Reading Comprehension Developing Fiction and Nonfiction Skills program for 
third through eighth grades.  The latter includes a writing piece for struggling writers as well as 
enrichment. For the after-school program, we will use Pearson Longman's Backpack, seven-level 
communicative program.  For both programs, we will also include a literacy piece for read-
alouds of folktales, biographies, autobiographies, featured articles, and non fiction text.  The 
four ENL teachers will serve Grades 1-8, on Saturdays from 9 am - 11 am for a total of 24 
sessions.  They will differentiate their instruction to address each student's needs, and the 
language of instruction will be English.  The students will be provided with all materials and 
supplies such as notebooks, paper, pencils, crayons, markers, construction paper, chart paper, as 
well as technology such as laptops.  The anticipated measurable outcome is that students will 
advance a level as evidenced in the NYSESLAT. 
 
Home languages will be supported with the use of bilingual dictionaries, books in students' 
native languages, and translated materials in students' native languages.  A library of multi-

Begin description here:            
  The ENL teachers will attend Professional Development workshops and conferences outside of 
the school sponsored by TESOL, NYSABE, and District 08X. The workshops and conferences 
will focus on providing teachers and educational leaders strategies and tools necessary to educate 
a new generation of biliterate students.  We anticipate that the conferences will offer 
presentations, roundtable discussions, and special sessions on current topics such as the Common 
Core State Standards, the NYS Seal of Biliteracy, data driven instruction, and the role of 
instructional leadership in ensuring quality Bilingual Education programs; Dual Language 
programs; and ENL programs.  The connection to our Title III program is that through 
professional development, we will be able to help our students meet the Common Core 
Standards; improve oral language development; and enhance language acquisition using 
scaffolding strategies and data driven instruction.   Twice a month, ENL providers will engage in 
curriculum mapping that is grounded in NYSESLAT data to improve rigorous instruction in both 
reading and writing.  
The ENL Team will conduct PLCs for content and elementary and middle school 
teachers.  Topics include:  
*RTI for ELLS- 11/13 and 11/20 
*Scaffolding Strategies for ELLs- 12/4 and 12/18 
*Differentiating  Instruction for ELLs and SWDs-  Two sessions in Jan. 2019 
*Teaching ELLS Academic Vocabulary Two sessions in Feb. 2019 
* Use of Technology with ELLS- Two sessions in March 2019 
*Integrated Co-Teaching with ENL Providers-  Two sessions in Nov. 2018 
All Title III LEP program service providers will participate in the above-described professional 
development.  Attendance and agendas will be kept on file in the school Title III binder.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Begin description here:            
  The rationale behind our parent engagement activities is to facilitate parent involvement in 
helping their children meet the Common Core Standards. Parents will be informed of the clear 
academic expectations.  Parents will be notified of the Saturday Academy via letters written in 
their dominant language and phone calls.  Workshops will be offered throughout the school year 
on the following topics:  NYS ELA and Math Exam, Test Preparation, Reading, Writing, and 
Vocabulary. These meetings will help us provide parents with different strategies, skills and 
resources to help their children at home, thus empowering the ELL community.  The ENL 
teachers, along with the Parent Coordinator will spearhead outreach efforts.  Parents will also be 
invited to learn English on Saturdays from 9 a.m.- 12 p.m.  while their children attend ENL 
classes.  The ENL teachers will also attend PTA meetings to answer questions and provide 
resources for parents of ELLs.  Six workshops will be given to parents by the ENL teachers, the 
Literacy Coach and Math Coach. Two will be given on Saturdays at 12:00 p.m., and four will be 
given during parent engagement on Tuesday afternoons, 45 minutes to an hour each, at no cost to 
Title III.  The months we have selected are December, January, February, March, and 
April.   Saturday Parent Workshops will be held on November 9th, 2018 and January 12, 
2019.  Tuesday Parent Engagement Workshops will be held on December 18th, February 
5th,  March 19th and May 21st.   Saturday Parent Engagement Activities will be held on January 
12th and February 9th from 12:00-1:00.  Topics will include "How to Prepare Your Child for the 
NYS ELA Exam" and parents will be provided resources to support their children.  The second 
topic will include "How to Prepare Your Child for the NYS Math Exam." 
Attendance and agendas will be kept on file in our Title III LEP binder.  Additionally translation 
services will be provided to parents during our workshop sessions.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
1.  The assessment tools our school uses to assess the early literacy skills of ELLs are Fountas & Pinnell Benchmark Assessment 
System.  Some expanding and transitioning ELLs can do the pre-assessments from the Lucy Calkins Reading and Writing 
Curriculum currently being utilized at our school.  We also use IReady and NYSESLAT Benchmark Assessments.  We identify the 
areas of concern and plan next steps for instructional purposes.  We pinpoint the skill/s our ELL's need to improve, and we 
plan accordingly.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The ENL & ICT classroom teachers have divided the assessments into the ENL group and non-ENL group.  The ENL teacher 
administers the assessments for the ENL students. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
8.  We evaluate the success of our program by examining the data from the results of the NYSESLAT and the other state exams 
to identify strengths and weaknesses.   Upon examining the RLAT report, the data indicates that our ELLs' areas of need are 
reading and writing.  We also use NYC Performance Tasks to monitor the progress of our students.  We administer pre, mid, 
and post-assessments and track our students' development.  
  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Teachers collaborate and exchange ideas on how to help ELLs.  ENL teachers are co-teaching in classrooms with a general 
education teacher for 2 periods a day during the 90 minute Literacy Block on a daily basis.  They differentiate all the lessons 
with strategies and modifications that address the different levels of the ENL students. Grammar points are explained and 
students are given exercises to reinforce what is learned.  Reading strategies are taught for students to tackle the meaning of 
new words using context clues.  Students are given listening exercises to improve their listening skills which are necessary, 
especially in middle school when note-taking is expected.  The native language is used when newcomers need help to 
understand concepts in math or science.  Newcomers are also tutored in their native language by bilingual staff members and 
peer tutors.     
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
ENL teachers use formative and summative assessments.  The results help in planning for instruction that will take into 
account the weaknesses of the ELLs.  For example, students who have problems with listening comprehension need repetition 
and simpler directions so that they can understand what is asked of them. Grammar is a significant focus on the writing part of 
the NYSESLAT assessments.  Teachers spend time on the grammatical rules of the English language so that the students can 
identify a correct sentence from an incorrect one; editing their writing pieces also helps reinforce their grammar abilities 
.  Periodic assessments are a good indication of the gains the ELLs make and are a good indicator of how the students will do 
on the NYSESLAT. Suggestions made based on the results are shared.  What is also shared is if these suggestions have worked.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data patterns on the NYSESLAT reveal that the areas of reading and writing seem most in need of assistance, followed by 
listening and speaking.  Entering and Emerging students acquire listening and speaking skills earlier than the reading and 
writing skills.  The upper grade students are in need of refining their reading comprehension and organizational skills in writing 
in order to score Commanding.  Modeling writing is used to teach the students how to express themselves through 
writing.   As for the ELA in all grades, there was a 7.8% decrease in Level 1's; a 10.5% increase in Level 2's; and there was a 
2.7% decrease in Levels 3's and 4's.  In Math, there was a 6.1% increase in Level 1's; an 8% decrease in Level 2's; and a 1.9% 
increase in Levels 3's and 4's.         
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

We meet weekly to collaborate and plan.  Additionally, we use resources such as inquiry meetings, emails, GoogleDrive, 
and planbook.com to disseminate findings and adjust our programs.

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Our ENL program consists of 8 ENL-ICT classes from first grade to the fifth grade.  One teacher is assigned to two 
grades, two periods each, on a daily basis.  There are approximately 12 ENL students in each of these classes ranging 
from Entering to Commanding. In addition, we have two periods daily of Stand-Alone to service the remaining 
ENL students who are not in an ICT class.      

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Paste response to questions here:    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Paste response to questions here:    

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Entering and Emerging ENL students receive 1 unit of study in Stand-Alone-ENL and 1 unit of Integrated ENL/ELA (360 minutes) 
per week.  Transitioning and Expanding students receive .5 unit of Stand-Alone ENL and .5 unit of Integrated ENL/ELA (180 
minutes) per week.   Commanding ENL students receive .5 unit of Integrated ENL/ELA per week (90 minutes).  All units of 
instruction are delivered by certified ENL teachers.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
  The language used when teaching the content areas is English; however, as stated earlier, if the classroom teacher speaks the 
same language as the newly-arrived ELLs, then the native language is used to facilitate learning one-on-one.  The instructional 
approach for teaching is hands-on.  For example, visuals like maps and globes are used to show a map key, to teach the 
capitals, and the land formations of the different regions.  In science, for example, we use visuals and videos to show the 
difference between living and non-living.  Students analyze parts of plants and label them.  In other words, we strongly believe 
in a hands-on approach to learning for our ELLs.  We immerse the students in a print-rich environment.  Picture cards, 
photographs, and SMARTboards are used as visual teaching tools.  We also use graphic organizers and model well-written 
pieces using the Smartboard.  The ENL teachers collaborate with classroom teachers and support their instruction so there is 
continuity in/from the classroom to the program thus supporting the ELLs in the content areas.  The ENL teachers follow the 
curriculum maps that are aligned to each grade and the Targeted Skills of the Week from our literacy program.  The ENL 
teachers use the Spotlight ENL program for Stand-Alone which is effectively aligned with the Common Core and the school's 
literacy programs.  Students are supported in developing their listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills. Leveled books are 
used.  Based on formal and informal assessments, our students are grouped and provided with appropriate materials to 
enhance instruction.  At P.S./M. S. 71,  the ELA program we use is Teachers College Lucy Calkins Reading and Writing 
Curriculum, and for math we use the Go Math! program.       
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

  Students whose native language is Spanish are given the Spanish LAB along with the NYSITELL when they are first 
admitted.  This exam gives the ENL teacher and classroom teacher an idea of the skills the student has acquired in Spanish.  In 
addition, other ELLs who speak other languages are interviewed by pedagogues who are fluent and literate in their 
languages.  This interview gives us additional insight into the skills the student has acquired in his/her native language.  When 
an ELL has been referred and is to be evaluated by our SBST team, a bilingual psychologist is used to test the student in his/her 
native language in addition to the English-speaking psychologist.  At P.S. /M.S. 71, we take every precaution to assure that ELLs 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

are not referred solely on the basis of their English skills.  The opinion of the bilingual psychologist, outcome from the 
evaluations, and the recommendations are adhered to with the consent of the parent/guardian.

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d.

a.  Presently, we group our SIFE students based on their proficiency level with other students.  We offer assistance in the 
content areas.  We do this to ensure our students maintain growth.  We also offer Saturday and After-School Programs where 
students work on their language skills in a small-group setting.  Additional interventions such as AIS; Peer Tutoring; and pairing 
the student with a Learning Leader who speaks his/her language are also implemented. 
  
b.  ENL teachers collaborate with their co-teachers to develop lessons that differentiate for Newcomers. Teachers use hands-
on activities like visuals and books that help develop their phonetic and syntactical skills and supplement the TC 
curriculum.  Teachers model writing with graphic organizers.  The latter help the students expand their vocabulary and develop 
the four modalities.  In addition, we have ordered our Math program textbooks in the students' native language where 
available.  In this way, the students can progress in the content area while learning English.  Chapter books in the students' 
native languages are also used.  To speed up progress, we offer Saturday and After-School programs where newcomers work 
on their language skills in a small-group setting.  Reading for Comprehension, Reading Comprehension:  Developing Fiction 
and Nonfiction Skills, and Preparing for the NYSESLAT and beyond offer newcomers the strategies and practice that they will 
need for the ELA. 
  
c.  The ENL teachers are the resource and support for classroom instruction in an attempt to help students meet the state 
standards for their specific grade level in all subject areas.  Classroom teachers regularly conference with the ENL teachers to 
discuss the progress of the ELLs in the classroom.  Ideas are exchanged so that the needs of the ELLs are better met.  Students 
who have completed 3 years of ENL service and have not scored Commanding are given an extension so that we can meet 
their needs.  These students need to refine their writing skills; therefore, emphasis is placed on the writing 
process.  Brainstorming; organizing; editing; and publishing are skills that these students must master in order to be successful 
writers.  Grammar and spelling rules are also emphasized.  The Write Source, Spin, and Betty Azar's Grammar books are used 
as supplemental resources.   
  
d.  As far as long-term ELLs are concerned, collaboration with the classroom teachers on addressing the weaknesses in the 
specific areas is imperative.  The classroom teachers and the ENL teachers implement interventions which the ENL teachers 
use as well to address the student's needs.  Progress is tracked. These interventions may also include AIS, tutors, mentors, and 
learning leaders.  If benchmarks are not met, then the teachers and the guidance counselors along with the Principal and 
Assistant Principals meet to discuss possible options.  The parents/guardians are always consulted and included in the 
meetings.  Referrals may also be an option in which case the Bilingual Psychologist's evaluation will help our decision.   
e.  Former ELLs are given support after scoring Commanding for two years as mandated.  Former ELLs are also included in the 
After-school ENL Program and the Saturday Academy for ELLs.    
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers of ELL-SWDs use concrete teaching tools such as visuals and hands-on activities in order to facilitate comprehension 
of newly-introduced concepts.  Phonemic awareness and phonics are taught and reinforced through hands-on materials and 
computer programs.  Textbooks and chapter books accompanied by audio cassettes are used in listening centers.   We have 
arranged for our AIS providers to push-in to our ELL-SWDs classroom and assist the classroom teacher.  The AIS 
teacher have guided lessons formulated by the classroom teacher.  This lesson will be a reinforcement of  a previous lesson 
given by the homeroom teacher.  The ELL-SWDs will have a supported opportunity to practise skills using manipulatives and

visual prompts to help them build on language skills.  ELL-SWDs are included in our Stand-Alone program, and Saturday and 
After-School programs.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
When our ELL-SWDs meet with the ENL teachers, they are grouped with their general ed. peers.  This opportunity provides a 
chance for them to be in a least restrictive environment where they feel comfortable and are productive.   We have arranged 
for our AIS providers to push-in to our ELL-SWD's classroom and assist the classroom teacher.  The AIS teacher will have a 
guided lesson formulated by the classroom teacher.  This lesson will be a reinforcement of  a previous lesson given by the 
homeroom teacher.  The ELL-SWDs have a supported opportunity to practise skills using manipulatives and visual prompts to 
help them build on language skills. Additionally, we are also presently using the Pinnell Fountas Phonics program with the First 
and Second grade to provide and improve basic foundational skills at an early stage.                                      
  
                                                  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Our AIS, Saturday Academy, and After-Schools programs help ELL's progress in the content areas.  The targeted groups in these 
supplemental services are the Entering and Emerging students (newcomers), however, all ENL students are welcomed. Our 
Stand-Alone ENL teacher and AIS providers are valuable supports for our students who require the strategies to be better 
readers and writers in Grades 1-2.  Our push-in AIS teachers focus on the individual needs of students in the small-groups they 
service.  These needs include improvement in reading and writing skills as well as content area reinforcement.  Our Saturday 
Academy and After-School programs offer additional hours to the students so that they can review and work on math and 
literacy skills.       
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We are currently working on creating new Benchmark Assessments which will better identify the needs of our ELLs and track 
their progress.  2017-2018 will be our second year of ENL ICT classes, and we are organizing an ENL leveled-library.   
   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Paste response to question here:  None.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELL's are offered the same support and resources as other students.  They have equal access to after-school programs, AIS, 
Peer Tutoring, Learning Leaders, and the Saturday Academy.  These are examples of supplemental services available to our 
students.     
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All forms of technology are used to support ELLs, for example, Laptop's, smartboards, Elmo's, audio-visuals (headphones and 
iPads), and music programs are a variety of technological resources used to support ELL's.  For Entering and Emerging students, 
we use Rigby, phonics books, Write from the Start, Spotlight on English, and Longman's Cornerstone as supplemental 
materials.  For Transitioning students, we use Betty Azar's Grammar, Rigby, Spin!, Spotlight on English, and Into English. For 
Expanding students, we use Reading Comprehension:  Developing Fiction and Nonfiction Skills, On Location:  Reading and 
Writing for Success in the Content Areas, and Betty Azar's Fundamentals English Grammar.  Dictionaries, chapter books, and 
textbooks in the students' native languages, and peer tutoring using the students' native language are resources that are 
available to our students.  Materials are purchased for students in their native language for independent reading.  In addition 
to the ENL teacher, there are language teachers who teach Spanish.  These teachers conduct instruction in both languages. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

Paraprofessionals and teachers assist ELLs using their native language regularly during classroom instruction by guiding the 
students through the lesson and keeping them on task.          
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Bilingual dictionaries, chapter books and textbooks in the students' native languages, and peer tutoring using the students' 
native language are resources that are available to our students.  Materials are purchased for students in their native language 
for independent reading.  In addition to the ENL teachers, there are language teachers who teach Spanish.  These teachers 
conduct instruction in both languages. Paraprofessionals and teachers assist ELLs using their native language regularly during 
classroom instruction by guiding the students through the lesson and keeping them on task.  Our staff assesses the work 
produced in the children's native language in order to check for comprehension of lesson objectives.      
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Our resources are age-appropriate.  When we choose our materials, we bear in mind the level, age, grade, and interests of our 
students, and we also ensure that they are aligned with the Core Content.  These materials correspond to what is taught in the 
class. Therefore, class instruction is reinforced in the ENL program and ENL ICT class.  The ENL teachers modify the content 
area lesson and differentiate so that the ELL's keep up with their peers.  In this way, they are taught the curriculum that every 
one else is.       
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We meet with parents to introduce them to the New York City Public School System.  ENL staff and the parent coordinator 
hold parent workshops and orientations. We also have students tour our school.  Our guidance counselor speaks to the 
parents about the students' daily schedules; school regulations; electives offered, etc. to familiarize them with their new 
school.                        
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

The school offers Spanish as an elective for the 6th, 7th, and 8th grades.   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Paste response to question here:  Not applicable.  
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Professional development is given to keep the teachers updated on the mandates and regulations of the ENL ICT 
program.  They are also given ENL strategies for teaching content area subjects.  They are familiarized with the  NYSESLAT, so 
that they are aware of the format of the exams and the standards they address.  Teachers are  introduced to the registration 
process and the importance of the Home Language Identification Survey. Attendance sheets and agendas are kept on 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

file.   Workshops, meetings and conferences outside the school at the Regional offices, Fordham University ,and other schools 
are attended by the ENL teachers and their co-teachers who then turnkey to all personnel who work with ELLs.  In addition, 
our ELL Director, Kristy De La Cruz, along with other district support staff conduct on site professional development for all 
teachers of ELL's.  Our ENL team also work with non-pedagogic staff (School Assessment Team, Guidance, Paraprofessionals, 
and Parent Coordinator) to review current policies that affect our ELL population.     
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
    
The school provides professional development for all teachers that is dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on 
best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English Language Learners.  For 
all bilingual and English as a new language teachers, a minimum of fifty percent of the required professional development 
hours must be dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction.  Agendas for each 
professional development event are produced and provided as well as attendance sign in sheets for all who attend the 
event.  By providing professional development in the school and also allowing our teachers to attend outside PLC's, we meet 
the requirements as per CR Part 154.2.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
At P.S. 71, there are monthly P.T.A. meetings that are announced through fliers, e-mails, and P.T.A. Newsletters. Our parent 
coordinator is bilingual and is always available in translating.  Workshops for our parents are held so that they can better 
understand the NYC Public School System; the upcoming state exams; and the strategies parents can use to help their children 
succeed.  Parents also attend Saturday English classes where they learn the language as their children attend ENL 
supplemental classes.  Our Literacy and Math Coaches and AIS teachers hold workshops for parents to help them assist their 
children at home.  Monthly Coffee and Conversations with the principal are offered as another venue for our parents to get 
involved with our school. We, also, have Parent Engagement on Tuesday afternoons for all K to 8 parents.  
  
Teachers individually meet with the parents or guardians of English Language Learners on Tuesdays after school, in addition to 
parent-teacher conferences, and initial parent orientations.  They are informed of their children's progress in language 
acquisition and in other content areas.  We have developed a school-wide template to log attendance of the Annual ELL One-
on-One conferences. 
 
Every effort is made to ensure that parents complete the Parent Survey & Program Selection Form, and outreach attempts are 
tracked and maintained at the school using existing procedures established within the school. The parent choice is recorded in 
the ELPC screen, however, schools may not select "parent did not return the survey" until the eighteenth school calendar day 
after initial enrollment.     

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

As mentioned above, we have the Saturday ESL for Parents Program.  This program provides the parents with information 
about the Common Core Curriculum, strategies to help their children at home as well as simple conversational skills.   We hold 
monthly coffee and conversation events for parents so that they stay informed of school activities, events, and up and coming 
assessments.  Our PTA hosts monthly meetings and organizes grade-specific events for children and parents to attend.  For 
example, we have scheduled a Halloween Family Game Night in October.  The school hosts grade-specific events such "Donuts 
with Dads " and ice cream socials.  Our annual book fair is very successful.  Announcements are sent in the home language, and 
our multi-lingual staff also reaches out to parents.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Margaret Mirando, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

 

We assess the language preferences of our parents by reviewing the HLIS's; the questionnaire we give our parents 
at the time of registration; ATS reports (RMNR, RLAT, RPOB, and RAPL); the Parent Coordinator's information 
sessions and funded meetings. We also refer to the Student Emergency Contact cards. We then are able to review 
the information and prepare for translation services. The availability of translation/interpretation services has 
always been a priority. Identifying parents who require written information in another language and interpreters 
when meeting with staff is of utmost importance.

How do you plan to translate? Include 
procedures to ensure timely provision 
of translated documents to parents.  

Documents will be sent in the parents' 
preferred language and in English as 
indicated in the parents' responses. 
School staff and the DOE's LTI services 
will be utilized in a timely fashion.  

Written translation services will be 
provided by using the Intranet, 
Translation Interpretation Unit or in-
house staff. Non-covered languages 
will be translated either by a DOE 
vendor or read to the parent using 
over-the-phone interpretation.  

Parent letters will be emailed out to 
staff so that they can be translated in a 
timely fashion. The T & I Unit will be 
used.  

The letters are available on the DOE 
website in our parents' native 
language.  

In-house staff, the T & I Unit, and a 
DOE vendor, when necessary, will be 
used.  

2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as 

parent-teacher  
conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.

provide interpretation service(s)?  

We have staff who speak a number of 
languages. Should the need arise for 
additional languages, we will contact 
the Language Line for immediate 
interpretation.  

Interpreters will be available for these 
conferences so that parents gain a 
sense of security as they make 
educational decisions for their 
children.  

Staff members will be made available 
to interpret as well.

parents appropriate interpretation 
services.  

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

Our school uses School Messenger to send messages to families via phone and email translated to the home language 
for all families.  

Included in the classroom emergency folder, there will be the Three-Step flyer to access Language Line. Teachers will 
have familiarized themselves with the preferred language of their parents so that they can request an interpreter for 
that language.  

In the event that parents need to reach us, we will use the Hello Parent Phone Script. This informs the parents that a 
three-way call with an interpreter and staff member is possible.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

The Chancellor's Regulation A-663 is distributed to staff in the beginning of the school year. The Language Access 
Coordinator and the Parent Coordinator will provide a professional development in order to train staff on the 
available language resources. School personnel will continue to be provided training on how to use translation 
services and over-the-phone interpretation services. Yearly we collect the names of faculty who can provide 
assistance with translation and interpretation through the School Staff Language Survey.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

In the lobby of our school and in the main office, we post notices of our parents' rights. This includes the Welcome 
Poster; Parents' Bill of Rights; Parents' Guide to Language Access; and the Language ID Guide at the security desk and

main office. At our meetings, we again inform our parents of their rights and offer translation services. School 
personnel and on-site interpreters for families are present.    

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

          By distributing the Language Access Parent Survey in the parents' preferred language, we will be able to 
monitor our communication success with our parents. The feedback will be used to improve the system we have set 
in place.
