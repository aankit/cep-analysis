Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview

-75% of all HSMSE students take the American Association of Teachers of German (AATG) Exam.  

-75% of all HSMSE students take the NYS (equivalent) Regents Exam in German. 

Freshmen Academy: 

Freshmen Academy is a one-semester course that provides a foundational introduction to incoming students at 
HSMSE. The course provides the students with an overview of the school’s academics. Freshmen learn about the 
disciplines and potential academic tracks that the school has from successful upper classmen and members of the 
faculty. Instructors provide freshmen with a set of skills that assist the students in the transition from middle school to 
college.  

Four Year Research Sequence: 

The Four Year Research Sequence begins with a one-semester freshman course that introduces students to the skills 
and methods used in conducting research in various disciplines, providing students with the knowledge and tools they 
need to succeed through the HSMSE curriculum and beyond.

HSMSE students ranked 1 st in the nation in 2013 and over 90% passing every year since HSMSE’s initial participation 
in 2007.  

Faculty: 

Many with post-graduate degrees; many with prior private industry experience (engineering, architecture, actuarial) ; 
many with prior and current college level teaching experiences 

 

HSMSE @ CCNY Community Outreach and Recruitment Efforts 

Even though their research study, service learning, and internship opportunities take HSMSE students around the 
CCNY campus, city, and other parts of the world, HSMSE students are part of a close-knit school community. 

HSMSE Middle School STEM Initiative Program: 

The High School for Math Science and Engineering Middle School STEM Initiative Program introduces Middle School 
students to the exciting world of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and prepares them for 
the Specialized High School Exam (SHSAT) with after-school academic and extra-curricular sessions offered by HSMSE 
faculty and Saturday Test Preparation sessions offered by a text preparation program. There is an extra-curricular 
component to this program because research shows that student involvement in extra-curricular activities has a 
positive impact on educational attainment and aspirations. Additionally, current HSMSE students interact with the 
middle school students as tutors both in HSMSE and in the local middle school. Lastly, during the school year, HSMSE 
hosts various middle schools for tours to introduce them to STEM at HSMSE. 

Academic Partners: 

Our students benefit from ground-breaking programs made possible through academic partnerships. The City College 
of New York grants HSMSE students access to their major research libraries, internships in labs, and use of the 
college’s athletic and dining facilities.  

The CCNY College Now Program and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center sponsor “Lunch and Learn: A 
Professional View” workshops for HSMSE students to interact directly with various professionals. 

 

-Cultural Partners: 

The Goethe-Institut PASCH Partnership Program, American Association of Teachers of German (AATG), and German 
American Partnership Program (GAPP) support HSMSE’s German program by funding travel-study to Germany for 
several HSMSE students each summer.  

PASCH is a partnership program between HSMSE and the Federal Republic of Germany, officiated by the Goethe 
Institut, here in the USA and worldwide. Each year students in grades 10, 11 and 12 can apply for one of two PASCH 
Scholarship trips to Germany, during the summer for 3 weeks of classes and cultural enrichment. The goal is that they

from our school and nation to the world. Students submit an essay and transcripts and participate in an interview in 
German to be selected.  

The AATG funds a four-week study trip program in Germany that includes a family stay, attendance at a Gymnasium, 
and participation in tours. HSMSE has had seven trip winners and many honorable mentions over the history of our 
program that is in addition to our PASCH Partnership Program. 

The GAPP is a non-profit high school exchange program between schools in Germany and the United States, 
sponsored by the German Foreign Office and by the US Department of State . Their main objective is the integration 
of students into the everyday life of host families and into the classroom activities of host schools to provide them 
with a coherent intercultural experience.  
 
 Professional Organization Partners: 

Project Lead the Way designed our core engineering curriculum. Students have opportunities for internships during 
the summer and throughout the year. Upper class students in the biomedical concentration spend half of the school 
day in research labs and clinical rotations at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. 

High Bridge Capital PENCIL Partners: 

HSMSE’s High Bridge Capital PENCIL Partners have donated various technological resources such as computers and 
printers to HSMSE. More importantly, they have donated human resources towards the professional development of 
HSMSE’s entire Junior class by leading workshops on resume writing, time management, and marketing oneself for 
employment. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Diversity: 

In a 2012 diversity poll conducted by The New York Times , HSMSE was rated the most diverse of NYC public schools. 
In the years passing the diversity has changed and is now inclusive of Hispanic, Black, Caucasian and Asian populations 
with Hispanic and Asian populations rising each year. Additionally our student population of students with special 
needs in areas particularly with anxious personalities and students on the spectrum.  

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

As we ended the year it became very clear that our Strong Family Ties and Rigorous Instruction had successfully 
influenced our school community. In moving forward next year we are stressing supportive environment and effective 
school leadership to provide more leaders within the school staff and continue in the direction of more inclusive 
environment.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Advanced Placement World History and English Literature are mandatory for all 9th, 10th and 11th graders. We would 
like to provide support for all students to succeed based on data trends from June 2018 AP examinations. School 
Mastery of Regents is at a high percentage and is not an area of growth need at this time. We are focusing area in 
need of growth on AP exams and specific lowest third populations based on Regents 2018 data.  

 

● Surveys of students and teachers identified a demand for more growth in Advanced Placement preparation.  

● According to the school quality snap shot, college and career preparatory exams successfully completed has had a 
decline of 5% in the overall pass rates which we attest to our recent AP Stats contribution and the APES. Both have 
since risen. 

* ALL AP scores last year were consistently high pass rates of 75% and higher excluding AP Calculus. AP Calculus pass 
rates were less than 35%. 

* SubGroup of lowest AP scores reveals seniors with early action decision to college and the majority of students 
assigned to Pre-Calculus full year followed by AP Calc AB senior year struggle to reach level 3 or higher on exams.  

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, AP Exam average pass rates will increase 5% when compared to the previous three year's average rates. 
Each exam is measured against its previous AP exam.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities

funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. The High School for Math, Science and Engineering , is responsible for creating 
and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement 
between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving 
them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to 
actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and welcomed members of the school 
community.  

 

The High School for Math, Science and Engineering will support parents and families of students by:

to improve communication with parents.  

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school surveys and 
feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and enhance the 
school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In the Parent Involvement Policy, parent members of the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), 
as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the Parent Involvement Policy and 
asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, 
the school will:

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
We use teacher-created assessments to provide us with each student's grade level in reading comprehension, writing, 
speaking, and listening skills.  The results offer a breakdown of specific areas of strengths and weaknesses so we can gear our 
instruction toward helping the student in areas of academic need and tailor extra help specifically to each student.  Teacher 
made assessments allow us to assess student decoding skills, vocabulary, and content-specific comprehension.  The results of 
teacher-created assessments are then shared with grade-level teacher teams and informs our school's instructional plan, 
approaches, and intervention services while also allowing us to design curriculum to address the specific needs of the 
student.  Our teachers work to develop reading and writing skills in all content areas.  Through this consistent reinforcement of 
reading and writing, as well as supports in before/after school tutoring and Saturday programming, student scores improve 
over time.     
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

For newcomers and SIFE we would initially use the LENS assessment to assess our students' literacy skills in their native 
language.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Teacher teams at HSMSE are organized both by discipline and grade level; teachers have dedicated time to work in these 
teams and reflect on the needs of targeted populations of students, ELLs being one of the identified groups that require 
additional team-reflection and intervention.  Teams work closely together reviewing student work and data to develop 
teaching strategies and structures to support students.  Our ENL instructor pushes in to these various team meetings to ensure 
that scaffolding and support for our ELLs are being addressed in the teams' discussions and agendas.   Furthermore, these 
teams use curriculum tuning protocols to better meet the needs of all students.  Additionally, other school-wide committees, 
such as the Accreditation Committee, Professional Learning Committee, Attendance Committee, and School Leadership Team, 
regularly meet to address issues of importance within our school community, one of which is facilitating and supporting the 
success of ELLs at HSMSE. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of our program is measured through the analysis of a wide array of data, including: 
1.  ELL Periodic Assessment and NYSESLAT scores 
2.  ELL course assessments in all content levels 
3.  Graduation rate 
4.  Course pass rate 
5.  Regents pass rate 
6.  Advanced Placement courses pass rate 
7.  PSAT and SAT scores 
8.  Attendance rate 
9.  Learning Environment Survey, student results 
10.  Learning Environment Survey, parent results 
11.  Learning Environment Survey, teacher results 
12.  Drop out rate 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

A variety of intervention structures are employed to address the summative data analysis: 
1.  ELLs who have attended school in their country of origin and in their home language past the age of 11 and thus qualify for 
the required number of Foreign Language credits toward graduation are programmed for an additional period of English 
language support for 90 minutes 2-3 times a week. 
2.   Saturday School - Academic Support - a weekly program that provides selected students with the chance to meet with 
content instructors in small groups and receive enrichment in areas of need. 
3.  Daily tutoring before and after school with course instructors. 
4.  Regents Prep classes, taught in English on Saturdays. 
5.  Advanced Placement prep classes, taught before and after school in relevant months, in English by content teachers. 
6.  Student Community, club, and athletic teams involvement - School organized and sponsored opportunities for students to 
do community service and leadership training, or pursue areas of interest outside the traditional school day.  These 
supplemental activities aid students in acquiring English through a variety of community involvement activities. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

 

NYSESLAT and NYSITELL data gathered over time indicates that the majority of ELLs who attend our school usually enter as 
Freshmen or Sophomores at the Expanding or Commanding level.   HSMSE is a specialized school (like Stuyvesant and Bronx 
Science) that requires a high score on the High School Specialized School Test (which is currently administered only in the 
English) to be admitted; our school does not receive students through open-enrollment.  Usually within their first two years at 
HSMSE, new students who arrived and were identified as ELLs test out and then receive support and services as Former 
ELLs.  Currently at HSMSE, we have one ELL student who received a score of Expanding on his middle school NYSESLAT.  He will 
be assessed again with the NYSESLAT at the end of this school year to gauge his language acquisition after a year of support, 
instruction, and content at our school.  An analysis of several years of NYSESLAT scores reveals that our students tend to enter 
HSMSE with higher scores in the reading and writing modalities but with lower scores in the listening and speaking 
modalities.  Subsequent scores tend to reflect large growth in all four modalities. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Summative data that is gathered is distributed to our counselling staff as well as discipline and grade-level instructional 
teams.  Teams meet regularly to reflect on the data, identify patters, and develop targeted action for improving student 
achievement as a whole and in identified sub-categories. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Because of the nature of our school (a Specialized school with the required SHST admittance exam), most students 
who enter as ELLs have been assessed with the NYSESLAT at the Expanding or Commanding level.  Likewise, students 
new to the NYCDOE are administered the NYSITELL and are typically identified with scores of either Intermediate or 
Tested-Out.  
 
Students with a score of either Expanding or Intermediate typically receive 180 ENL minutes per week, which consists 
of a daily 45 minute standalone ENL class five times a week.  Students who receive a score of Commanding or Tested-
Out receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA per week, which consists of two 45 minute ENL/ELA periods twice a 
week.  Additionally, former ELLs receive 135 minutes of homework help and study hall support three times a week.   
 
Students at HSMSE follow a block schedule of 90 minute periods.  Because of our relatively low number of ELLs, we 
typically are able to arrange our standalone and integrated ENL classes in ways that complement student schedules 
and which ensures that we provide the needed services with the least interruptions to the student's content courses 
and in the least restrictive environment possible.  Furthermore, our instructors differentiate instruction for all 
students and additionally meet the needs of ELL or Former ELL students with support from our 
ENL/ELA instructor.  Other instructional support for former ELL students include extra tutoring, language acquisition 
support, and instructor check-ins during regular course work.  The ENL instructor and content instructors regularly 
communicate to develop and collaborate on appropriate class work and homework assignments, assessments, and 
instructional goals. 
 
Again, due to the historically and relatively low number of students who score below an Expanding or Intermediate on 
the appropriate exams, when we service the needs of ELLs in our school, they are typically supported in 
heterogeneous groups by grade level but homogeneous groups by language proficiency level.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

As per the new CR Part 154 requirements, students are carefully programmed to receive the mandated ENL and 
ELA instructional minutes based on the new proficiency guidelines.  As stated previously, students attending HSMSE usually 
arrive at either an Intermediate/Expanding level or a Tested-Out/Commanding level.  Students at the Expanding level receive 
180 minutes of ENL a week (45 minutes of standalone ENL, 5 times a week).  Students assessed at Commanding levels, or 
Former ELLs, receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA each week (45 minutes of ENL/ELA twice a week with 45 minutes of 
study hall and academic support three times a week).  Our instructor who is certified in ELA and is pursuing TESOL certification 
instructs both the integrated and standalone ENL classes in addition to the ELA content courses where she often provides 
additional supports and instruction to the ELLs and former ELLs in her class. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
At HSMSE, students take the core high school subjects of math, science, social studies, and ELA every year while also 
specializing in advanced courses from the fields of Math, Science, Engineering, and Computer Sciences.  Instruction, with the 
exception of the Foreign Languages Spanish and German, is in English.  Student class work, assignments, and assessments 
include a wide array of individual work, collaborative group work, written and spoken presentation of learning, exams, 
research, and projects. 
 
For students who have been identified as ELLs or Former ELLs (most often with scores of Expanding or Commanding), both 
content teachers and the TESOL instructor provide support for ELLs in all content area classes.  Students who have an 
Explanding proficiency are targeted through stand alone ENL courses that involve collaboration with content area teachers to 
scaffold and support work in specific classes.  Students with a Commanding proficiency are targeted through integrated 
ENL/ELA classes which promote both individual and collaborative tasks that develop language and content knowledge 
simultaneously.  Approach to curriculum is student centered, inquiry driven, and revolves around themes and essential 
questions that are often interdisciplinary.  Language and literacy are likewise developed through interaction with peers and 
teachers about meaningful ideas in authentic context.  In order to provide ELLs and Former ELLs with native language support, 
students are provided with bilingual dictionaries, translation applications and devices, peer group support, language peer 
mentors, native language texts and projects. 
 
The TESOL certified instructor works with teachers at the discipline and grade level to train and help them develop curriculum, 
materials, and assignments that scaffold the work with appropriate language acquisition skills.   Ongoing professional 
development focuses on development of instruction and teaching strategies that meet the language development needs of all 
students.  Furthermore, continued professional development sustained each year has aligned all of our courses and curriculum 
to the Common Core Learning Standards.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

At orientation, ELLs are given a native language assessment when it is determined to be appropriate.  For more common 
languages like Spanish or Mandarin, we have staff members who help students and family complete all appropriate intake 
materials and who are able to interview students and families in their native language.  Furthermore, staff members who 
speak various language provide feedback concerning student work and projects that are conducted or supplemented in part 
with student native language.  When needed, we draw upon appropriate assessment structures as determined by 
LOTE instructors in coordination with our TESOL teacher, who have CCLS aligned assessments for our LOTE program.  For 
language where we don't have formal assessments in place, we rely on community partners, peers, and families for feedback 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

throughout the year.   
 
As students progress in their acquisition of English, ELL and Former ELL students are provided with opportunities to access 
information in their home language.  Our school provides them with library resources, books and software in native language, 
translation applications and dictionaries, and peer partnering and mentoring in their home language. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

As stated previously, due to the nature of our school and the SHS entrance exam, most of our ELL students are identified with 
a proficiency score of Expanding or Commanding (Former ELLs).  If we needed to separate students into further sub groups - 
such as SIFE, Newcomer, or Long Term etc., we would do so according to need and ability. 
 
Most often, our differentiation of instruction occurs for students with Expanding proficiency or Former ELLs who fall into the 
Developing subgroup.  Our differentiation involves monitoring the students' class grades and exam scores, while also meeting 
weekly with the student to gather his/her feedback on language development and mastery of content.  Furthermore, 
instruction in classes incorporates multiple strategies for the acquisition of both language and content, including: layered 
curriculum, leveled reading materials, jigsaw readings, collaborative group work, oral presentations, project-based 
assessments, scaffolding, and testing accommodations (extended time, bilingual glossaries, use of Regent exams in native 
language when possible, etc).  In addition to the mandated minutes of integrated/stand alone minutes of ENL, students are 
also programmed for tutoring sessions held before/after school to provide content and ELL support for completing homework 
and preparing for projects, assessments, etc.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
At this time, we do not have any ELL-SWDs registered.  However, in the event that future students fit into this category, our 
Special Ed team along with our ELL coordinator will ensure that all language acquisition and IEP mandates are being met.  
 
Both the Special Ed team and the ELL coordinator would collaborate to ensure that the ELL-SWD student receives the 
appropriate program in the least restrictive environment.  After reviewing the mandates of the IEP, the full team of teachers 
would meet with the Special Education teacher to discuss specific instructional strategies that would prove valuable to the 
growth of the ELL-SWD student and follow the mandates of the IEP.  Students will be included in mainstream classes while 
receiving additional services in language, counseling, and adaptive physical education.  Teachers will meet regularly to review 
the progress of these students in accordance with their specific IEP and identified language needs.  Likewise, the ELL 
coordinator will ensure the purchase of any/all materials (laptops, audio players and recorders, calculators, reading guides, 
native language texts, etc) that are best suited for the ELL-SWD student and teachers will use this technology to support the 
students in ways that is appropriate to the student and the content area. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
We use the least restrictive environment as a guide.  We meet students where they are in terms of need.  If there is a need, we 
are flexible to ensure that all appropriate support is provided for the students.  Our school provides academic support 
programs and advisory for incoming 9  th   and 10  th   grade students to help them in their transition to a specialized high 
school.  We have a widely diverse student body and utilize the small-school nature of our school to ensure that each student's 
individual needs are identified and supported by the staff.  Teachers, support staff, and administration work together to 
identify the unique needs of individual students and to provide them with curricular, instructional, and scheduling supports to 
ensure their academic and language success.

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
As stated previously, because of the nature of our school - a specialized high school with admittance determined by 
the SHSE entrance exam - we have not historically had students who fell into these subgroups.  However, all of our targeted 
intervention programs are geared toward supporting all of our ELL students and would likewise address the needs of the ELL 
subgroups should we have increased future enrollment in one of those categories: 
 
1.  ELLs who have attended school in their country of origin and in their home language past the age of 11 and thus qualify for 
the required number of Foreign Language credits toward graduation are programmed for an additional period of English 
language support for 90 minutes 2-3 times a week. 
2.   Saturday School - Academic Support - a weekly program that provides selected students with the chance to meet with 
content instructors in small groups and receive enrichment in areas of need. 
3.  Daily tutoring before and after school with course instructors. 
4.  Regents Prep classes, taught in English on Saturdays. 
5.  Advanced Placement prep classes, taught before and after school in relevant months, in English by content teachers. 
6.  Student Community, club, and athletic teams involvement - School organized and sponsored opportunities for students to 
do community service and leadership training, or pursue areas of interest outside the traditional school day.  These 
supplemental activities aid students in acquiring English through a variety of community involvement activities. 
 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We plan to continue to develop our program for providing support to former ELLs, in compliance with and all new mandates, 
especially those concerning required minutes of standalone and integrated ENL or ENL/ELA.  We will ensure that these 
students are programmed for ELA and Integrated ENL simultaneously, under the instruction of our ELL Coordinator.  We will 
also continue to develop Professional Development trainings for teachers to make them better aware of how to support 
former ELLs in content instruction.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Our school offers an array of programs and enrichment activities.  All students, including all ELLs and Former ELLs, are 
encouraged to participate fully in them.  For example: 
Sports teams and clubs:  Soccer (boy and girl), Basketball (boy and girl), Cross Country Track (boy and girl), Indoor Track (boy 
and girl), Baseball (boy), Softball (girl), Dance Team (boy and girl), Ping Pong, etc. 
Academic and Social clubs:  The Fed Challenge, Euro Challenge, JSA,  Key Club, GSA, Black Student Alliance, HSMSE Muslim 
Student Society, The Gastronomy Club, School Leadership Club, Student Council, Robotics Club, Yearbook, Dr. Dragon STEM 
Journal, Math Team, etc. 
Academic Enrichment Programs:  Regents Review sessions, AP Exam Review Sessions, Saturday Homework Help Sessions, 
Before and After School Tutoring, NHS Peer Tutoring, PSAT and SAT Prep Courses, etc. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
If needed, ELL and Former ELLs are supplied with any/all of the following (where appropriate):  
Laptops, Ipads, and other adaptive technology. 
Microsoft Office Applications 
Texts and materials in native languages, including translations of Regents and other standardized exams. 
Google documents. 
Native language dictionaries and translation applications/devices.

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Multiple opportunities are provided for our ELLs to use native language in support of their content learning.  ELL students are 
supported by peers, community partners, family members, and school personnel.  Additionally, classroom libraries contain 
content materials in all our major languages.  Students also access information in their home language through the campus 
library, appropriate books and software, and internet resources, etc.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Our school has a very small student population, regardless of age or grade, all necessary services and supports are provided in 
accordance to student need. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
N/A 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Students are only admitted through the Specialized HS Entrance Exam at the beginning of the year.  The summer before 
students begin HSMSE, we host a student orientation which gives access to the building for tours.  We distribute textbooks and 
school documents.  Parents and students meet with current HSMSE students and teachers with the chance to ask questions 
about the school.  All necessary documents and informational sessions are translated/interpreted as needed.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Our school offers language electives in German and Spanish. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Our ELL Coordinator takes part in the NYCDOE professional development trainings that involve the administration of the 
NYSITELL and NYSESLAT exams, as well as the meetings and powerpoint presentations that explain the latest aspects of 
compliance in regards to ELL issues and state mandates.  She also networks with other schools that have well-established 
Freestanding ENL programs and seeks out development, guidance, and pedagogical support from them.  Our ELL Coordinator is 
also currently pursuing her Masters degree at CCNY for TESOL/Bilingual Education.  Likewise, our ELL Coordinator conducts 
turnkey PDs multiple times a year to provide TOEFL support and information to our staff.  Additionally, our LOTE staff attend 
trainings from various non-profit organizations that encourage the teaching of other languages.  Furthermore, our school has 
conducted several PDs around the new CCLS and has provided numerous opportunities for staff members to explore 
the CCLS and develop new curriculum around them.

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Our school regularly offers professional development for all staff that is geared toward improving ELL academic achievement 
and language development: 
 
1.  Multiple times a year our ELL coordinator shares instructional strategies for supporting students with language acquisition 
needs.  Professional development also details ways for teachers to communicate with parents who require interpretation 
services; in these sessions the staff shares techniques for facilitating parental involvement in the school 
community.  Additionally, counseling staff trains teachers to meet the social and emotional needs of all students, including 
ELLs as a subgroup.    
 
Likewise, our ELL coordinator provides Indirect Services to ELLs by  providing collaborative consultation with the general 
education teacher.  Such consultations focuses on adjusting the learning environment and/or modifying and adapting 
instructional techniques and methods to meet the individual needs of the ELL students in the general education classroom. 
Agreed upon strategies are delivered by the ESL education teacher and/or the general education teacher. 
 
2.  Grade level and discipline teams meet at least once a month (often more) to reflect on student progress and to  monitor 
student transition to our academic environment.  Teams discuss student support issues, implement student/parent outreach 
initiatives, and further explore various instructional strategies for teaching and engaging ELLs.   
 
3.  Additionally, our school is currently developing opportunities to do a professional development exchange with other 
schools that have larger ELL populations and more established ENL programs. 
 
4.  Finally, because we only have one ENL teacher on staff, this teacher meets her professional development requirements 
through participation in DOE and UFT trainings and professional development, while also pursuing a Masters degree in 
TESOL/Bilingual education at CCNY.  Furthermore, the ENL teacher takes advantage of opportunities to do intervisitations with 
schools that have larger ELL populations and established ENL programs. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
At HSMSE, we have tremendous support from the parents in our community.  We have a strong SLT and an active PTA.  We 
have parents that speak a wide variety of languages and this has helped with parents who are not proficient with English.  We 
also have many staff members and students who speak different languages and have served as interpreters for us.  For all 
appropriate school functions that involve parents, we make use of DOE interpreters and routinely use the over-the-phone 
translation service to maintain contact with parents.  Furthermore, our LAC meets each semester with the parents (in addition 
to Parent/Teacher Conferences), making use of staff or DOE translators, to discuss the students' language and content 
progress, language proficiency assessment results, and to answer parent questions and concerns.   

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Due to the fact that we have historically had very small numbers of ELLs or former ELLs, our school has found that we have a 
limited need for translation and interpretation services.  In the past, we have been able to meet the needs of our community 
with staff and parent volunteers.  The school provides (by posting on the school's website) most DOE documents and forms in 
multiple languages.  We have used written translation services in the past but found that most families did not take advantage 
of them.  Our school's website has a function that will translate the entire website to any language upon clicking on the desired 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

language.  On the school website, we post the following information (which can then be translated through the website 
function) : PTA newsletters, our school calendar, Parent-Teacher Conference announcements, Information for after-school 
programs, tutoring, and test-prep study sessions, along with New York State testing dates, contact information for individual 
teachers, and letters from the principal and guidance counselors,etc. 
 
The school has found that we have a limited need for translation services; however, in the event that translation or 
interpretation is needed, we anticipate meeting those needs in the following ways: the availability of translation services has 
been posted in our school near the main entrance; the poster outlines our ability to translate information and provide 
interpretation services in several languages.  If the needs of our community change, we will add additional services.  Likewise, 
we communicate with parents on a daily basis through an Internet program (Engrade) that allows them to view students' 
homework assignments, exams, and current grades.  Parents can access this web page to get a general idea of their child's 
standing in each class and to request meetings/information from individual teachers.  At the beginning of the year, we offer 
trainings and written directions in requested languages for how to log onto this website.  Through Engrade, teachers and 
parents can communicate via a messaging system that can include both an original text and Google translated version - such 
communications allow us to plan for in-person meetings that will make use of an interpreter.  The use of Engrade also provides 
family with a snapshot of their child's progress in numerical matters (grades, attendance, dates, etc) and then also allows for 
families to seek further clarification from the school or their community support networks. 
 
For the assorted monthly and yearly meetings that involve parents as well as individualized meetings with parents, the school 
has been able to provide necessary services through the use of staff members, parent and CCNY graduate student 
volunteers.  For DOE Parent-Teacher Conferences, we pay for translators to assist parents.  We have also purchased wireless 
mics with headphones to translate at various events (like Open House, Curriculum Night, the Awards Ceremony, and the Talent 
Show, etc) where parents are included.  We will continue to reach out to parents and provide services as needed.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Crystal Bonds, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Upon entering HSMSE, all students are given appropriate DOE forms to determine which language is spoken in the 
home. The information is then entered into ATS. A review of the information provided through the HLIS, ATS 
reports (like the RAPL and RCPL), and our student blue cards (and confirmed by teacher, PTA informal meetings, 
and other community mixers with parents) indicates that many students speak English in their home, with 
Chinese, Bengali, and Spanish as our biggest groups of LOTE speakers. At school, we have staff members who 
speak Spanish, as well as some who speak Mandarin, Cantonese, French, and German. These staff members often 
provide interpretation and translation support. For families who speak other languages, we utilize the translation 
services provided by the DOE vendors and make use of interpretation services through our relationship with the 
Bilingual Education Department from CCNY.

identifies a new language that is 
needed for translation, we either use 
staff to translate (like for Hebrew or 
French, for example) or the DOE 
Translation services. Submission for 
those translation of those new 
documents would occur in August 
once our enrollment information is 
obtained for incoming Freshmen. 

Please note: In our staff Professional

all school staff is informed of 
translation and interpretation 
resources. Documents alerting staff

As we use similar documents every 
year, they have already been 
translated at this point into our 
biggest language groups (Chinese, 
Spanish, and Bengali). When a new 
document is created or our HLIS 
identifies a new language that is 
needed for translation, we either use 
staff to translate or the DOE 
Translation services. Submission for 
translation of new documents would 
occur in the month before the 
document is needed. Monthly staff 
meetings assess the need for 
translation in new languages or for 
new documents. 

This document is posted online with 
the school website, which has a 
translation function that converts the 
entire page into any language 
selected by the parent. 

These documents are provided to our 
school by the State and City DOE, 
already translated into multiple 
languages.

We use several different modes for 
interpretation, depending on parent 
demand and attendance 
confirmation ahead of the 
conferences: 1) Teachers make use of 
Over-The-Phone Interpreter Services 
- provided by the DOE - and use the 
dual handset phone in the 
conference room to talk to parents, 
2) Staff and Graduate student 
volunteers (from CCNY) offer 
interpretation services for this event 
as needed. 3) We hire intepreters 
from the DOE Vendor, THE BIG 
WORD.

1. Robo-calls are recorded ahead of 
time and we are this year pre-
recording (using staff members as 
interpreters) these standard 
messages in our largest LOTE 
language groups (Chinese, Spanish, 
and Bengali). Parents in these groups 
are identified through our ATS-RAPL 
report (which has been disseminated 
prior). 

2. In the event of a new/time-specific 
call, or for low-incident languages, 
support-staff makes use of the 
Language Line to contact parents 
(using the ATS-RAPL generated list 
and an in-house communication 
survey that we've created to 
effectively register parent language 
preferences). This option is available 
to our school because of the 
relatively number of low-incident 
languages that our parents identify as 
their preferred language (1.43% as 
identified on the RCPL). 

   

 

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.

Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Professional Development sessions for faculty and staff, concerning each of the following, are planned regularly 
throughout the year: 1) Parent Outreach for Parents with LOTE as their preferred language, 2) Pedagogical techniques 
and classroom supports for ELLs and Former Ells, 3) Student Interventions and Outreach for ELLs and Former ELLs, 3) 
Review and assessment of progress for ELL and Former ELL students according to grade level. Trainings take place at 
the beginning of the year and also before various benchmarks in the year, like before Parent/Teacher Conferences, 
end of the semesters, and before State/City exams like the Regents or MOSL. The TOEFL teacher at HSMSE and the 
Humanities Assistant Principal further meet with individual teachers who have ELLs or Former ELLs in their classroom 
to provide additional assistance and information, as needed. FInally, the information and materials concerning the 
interpretation and translation services available through the DOE Language Line is distributed to staff and posted in 
the staff work room and conference room. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

We fulfill parental notification requirements by distributing the Parents' Bill of Rights and the Parents' Guide to 
Language Access with the other school documents that are mailed to incoming students (9 th grade) in June. Likewise, 
copies are included with the beginning of the year paperwork that is given to 10 th through 12 th grade students in 
September. Copies of all paperwork are available by request at PTA meetings. The Welcome Poster is displayed 
prominently at the entrance of the school and all security and main office staff are supplied with copies of the 
Language ID Guide yearly.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Our school plans to make use of the translated parent surveys that are available on the Translation and Interpretation 
Unit's Intranet page. Likewise, we are creating our own Parent Language Survey, specific to the experience of parents 
in our specialized high school setting, that our Parent Coordinator will then distribute to parents in an effort to gauge 
their language needs and which additional language supports that parents would like to see developed at HSMSE. This 
survey will be translated by staff for our most prominent LOTE subgroups (Bengali, Chinese, and Spanish). If/when the 
surveys aren't returned or the parent has indicated a low incident language on the HLIS, an oral survey will be 
conducted using the Language Line. 

Additionally, our school provides space for discussion of these needs in our monthly PTA and Principal's Breakfast 
meetings. They are also addressed specifically in the PTA agenda twice a year, as well as in our Curriculum Night and 
Open House presentations.
