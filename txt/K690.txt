Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

 

 

Vision Statement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

We believe that all students can learn and contribute positively to the community. Our vision is to create a learning 
environment that allows our students to become productive, successful members of society. We must stress 
everyday the values of responsibility, hard work, respect and cooperation and instill in students the motivation to 
learn. 

 

Mission Statement 

OUR MISSION IS TO CREATE AN INTERDEPENDENT LEARNING COMMUNITY WHERE ALL STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF 
RACE, ETHNICITY OR DISABILITY BECOME STRATEGIC LEARNERS, CAPABLE OF CREATIVELY AND EFFECTIVELY 
PROCESSING INFORMATION. THE COMBINED EFFORTS OF PARENTS, TEACHERS, STUDENTS, AND THE COMMUNITY 
AT LARGE WILL ENHANCE STUDENTS’ ABILITY TO “LEARN HOW TO LEARN”. THIS WILL ALLOW THEM TO BECOME 
ACTIVE LEARNERS AND PERFORMERS AFTER THEY LEAVE SCHOOL, CAPABLE OF DEALING WITH NEW KNOWLEDGE 
AS IT EMERGES AND ENCOURAGES THEM TO MATURE INTO ACTIVE CITIZENS AND LEADERS WHO RESPECT AND 
CELEBRATE DIVERSITY AND INDIVIDUALITY WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY.  

 

We believe that all students learn best when they are ENGAGED. Although S.T.O.R.M. drives our work, we believe 
that student engagement occurs when students are making their thinking visible in reading, writing and speaking.  

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Brooklyn Studio Secondary School is a 6-12 school located in the heart of Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. A neighborhood 
built on a long standing tradition of family values and multi-linguistic teaching practices, our school represents the 
polyglot that is Bensonhurst. We take great pride in educating the diverse families of the community. 

 

Although a school of the community, our school is structured to provide an instructional program that is Common 
Core based and prepares students for high school, college and career. Our partners in education are also, of the 
community like FIAO, College Now and St. Francis College. Just this year, our Digital Media and Communication 
program was certified a CTE program! 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our school services students of all educational needs, from Honors to Special Education to English as a Second 
Language. Regardless of population, we expect our students to reach the highest levels of academic achievement 
through an instructional program that is standards based and scaffolded to meet learning needs. Since our classes are 
heterogeneously mixed, we understand the challenge of meeting a myriad of learning needs. We employ different 
learning strategies to support learning based on Universal Design for Learning principles. One strategy in particular, 
multiple entry points, allows the teacher to plan for all students to have access into the curriculum and lessons. For 
our ELL students, we understand the need for students to receive the pertinent language acquisition skills, while at 
the same time, the social/emotional support to be successful in school. ELL students follow predominately a push-in 
model of services, reserving one-two periods a day in an ENL pull out program. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

With regards to the NYC Framework for Great Schools, Brooklyn Studio has made great strides in bringing all 
stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase learning opportunities: 

Pedagogy- utilizing our Instructional Leadership Team, teachers collaborate to identify key learning needs of 
professionals and provide professional development aligned to the Danielson Framework for Teaching. This has 
resulted in increasing the quality of teacher pedagogy, as evidenced by Advance data. 

Supporting Student Achievement and Social/Emotional Growth- utilizing feedback from students, teachers and 
parents, Brooklyn Studio has utilized our school schedule and devoted teacher C6 and after-school professional 
periods to engage in teacher team meetings that analyze student work products to make adjustments in to curriculum 
and instruction or to discuss student social/emotional growth to support student achievement. Additionally, our C6 
structure this year allows for teachers to support students social/emotional growth through the facilitation of clubs. 
We have also partnered with College Access for All, AP for ALL, TEALS, to encourage students in planning for their next 
steps after high school. 

 

This year, along with continuing the aforementioned work, we will collaborate to strengthen our family-community 
ties, to further support Brooklyn Studio’s presence in the community. Our priority if transparency in report student 
progress, through the usage of SKEDULA/Pupil Path and in fostering stronger ties with the community at large to 
address social needs within the community (SAPIS, DYC, NYC Board of Health Liaison, Valley National Bank).

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Brooklyn Studio has been committed to quality instruction for all students for the past four years. Prior to any 
mandate from the NYCDOE or NYSED, we conducted short frequent cycles of observation for teachers using the 
Danielson Framework for Teaching around competencies 1e (Designing Coherent Instruction), 3b (Questioning and 
Discussion Techniques and 3d (Assessment). At Studio, we believe that students learn best when they are engaged. To 
that end, our CEP goal for 2017-2018 was to have 93% of our teachers rated effective or higher in Danielson 
Competency 3c, Engagement. At the close of the 17-18 school year, the data showed that 92.3% (48 out of 52 
teachers rated)of teachers were rated "Effective" overall with 28.8% (15 out of 52) teacher rated "Highly Effective" 
overall in 3c.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By February 2019, 93%, and by June 95% respectively, of teachers, will receive an overall HEDI rating of Effective or 
Highly Effective in Danielson competency 3C Engaging Students in Instruction from the Danielson Framework for 
Teaching, as indicated by the Advance Dashboard by June 2019.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 
Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Create a teacher peer- intervention program that targets 
teachers in accordance with their rating in 3c. Teachers will visit 
each other to learn and implement best practices in alignment 
with our Instructional Focus and Danielson 3c (Engagement in 
Instruction). 

Create a Professional Development plan designed around the 
Instructional Focus, with a particular target on the pedagogic 
practice of Engagement. Provide cycles of professional 
development that support teacher practice around Danielson 3c 
Engagement. 

Create an Observation Cycle where observations are: a) 
conducted so actionable feedback can be given and teacher have 
the opportunity to implement feedback and b) feedback 
templates are created to standardize the support given to 
teachers given at a particular point in time in the observation 
cycle (inter-visitation, lesson planning, buddy program)

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Although not necessarily deemed as a “popular” subject by adolescents, mathematics skills play an integral role in 
augmenting reasoning and problem solving skills. Additionally, mastering the necessary skills increases students’ 
college and career readiness and prepares them to excel in the the more competitive industries of this century. Given 
this, a school must engage students to challenge themselves to meet greater growth in mathematics. Thus, it is 
understood that this can only happen through a school’s commitment in providing the necessary skills, resources and 
social/emotional support to students. Students at Brooklyn Studio must show greater progress in passing math exams 
with a 65 or higher. At the end of June of 2018, 59.91% of the students passed the Algebra Regents, 65% passed the 
Geometry Regents and 67.53% passed the Advanced Algebra and Trig Regents. Additionally, with regards to the W 
Cohort, 53% scored a 65 or higher on the Algebra Regents by August 2018, 16% of the W Cohort passed the Algebra 
Regents by August 2018 with an 80 or higher and 49% passed the Algebra Regents by August 2018 with a 70 or 
higher.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 80% of all Algebra I 9th grade (X Cohort) students in all subgroups will pass the Algebra Regents with 
a 65% or higher, and 40% of Algebra students in all subgroups receive an 80 or higher on the Algebra Regents, thus 
increasing the NYCDOE College and Career Readiness in Mathematics.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

A new teacher wants to be the most effective they can be with students and their achievement. How a teacher is 
supported by the school they work in can make the difference in how and if this happens. Out of the 55 teachers at 
Brooklyn Studio, 13 teachers have been in the school system for 4 years or less (23.6%) and 6 (11%)in the school 
system for less than 2 years. Moreover, 8 out of the 13 scored between a 2.45-3.11 in their MOTP 17-18. It is vital that 
they are given more intensive professional development in pedagogy to support their growth, student achievement 
and increase their potential for longevity and efficacy in the profession.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By the end of the 2018-2019 school year, our new teacher professional development series will impact the overall MOTP 
score of teachers in the following ways: a) 8 out of the 13 teachers will score an overall MOTP score of 3.25 or higher b) 
4 our of the 13 teachers will score a 3.65 or higher and c) 1 teacher in their 1st year will score a 3.00 or higher.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In the past five years, Brooklyn Studio has shown an increase in our ELL population, moving from approx. 35 students 
eight years ago to approx. 190 students presently. One subgroup within the ELL population that has increased in the 
number of MS students at a beginner level who have entered public school in their middle school years. Five years 
ago, we did not have this population, now we have about 20. As with any ELL student we wish to set them up for 
success when they take the NYS ELA Exam. Last year 18 students took the MS ELA exam for the first time in grades 6-
8. Out of the 18 students, 15 showed growth, whereas 7 moved up within a level and 8 moved up a full level. We 
believe that creating systems to enhance our teachers professionally in supporting students’ social and emotional 
growth will augment student growth. Out of the 18 students, at the end of the 2017-2018 school year, the data 
showed that 11 our of 18 (61%) students scored a level two or higher as indicated by the MS ELA results.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 70% of MS ENL students taking the MS ELA for the first time, will score a 2 or higher on the exam.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP) Template  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Brooklyn Studio , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the 
Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community.  

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

After school 
  In the ENL program, English is the language of instruction;  ENL lasses are differentiated by 
levels of English Language acquisition.  Students work to prepare for the NYSESLAT, which is 
a marker of progress.  ENL students work toward the advanced level and then to achieve success 
in meeting the New York State standards as reflected in the ELA regents examination. 
The service providers consist of 4 TESOL certified teachers.    
 We intend to allocate funds for three iPads for supplemental instructional support and cohesion 
amongst the ELL population.  The ultimate objective to achieve progress in reading, listening, 
speaking and comprehension skills.  
•     College- and career-ready standards  
•     High quality, valid assessments  
•     Professional Development for more effective teachers  
•     Intensive support and effective interventions       
     Our goal is to improve mathematics, ELA, history, and science learning.  The team analyzes 
the data from the previous year and creates strategies to support ELLs after school.  This data 
includes, ELA/MATH middle school exams, regents results, and overall cohort transcripts.  This 
time is also used for Social Studies and Science Regents Review.  The results of our middle and 
high school progress reports indicate that we have made sufficient progress in moving our 
ELLs.  We serve a total of 139 students, grades 6-12.  Our language of instruction is in English.  
Saturday Enrichment for ELLs runs for 16 Sessions:  Saturdays starting January 7th – June 24th 
from 9:00AM-12:00PM (excluding Saturdays during vacation time). 
Each Session of service is provided by four teachers: Marialucia Davi, Diana Blutstein, 
Francescsa, Davi, and Luisa Cary- all four TESOL certified and core teachers on a rotation 
basis.  The supervision of the Title III program will be at no cost to the program. Each teacher 
will take a grade level of ELLs. 6th grade - Ms. Blutstein,  6th grade - Ms. Cary, 7th grade - Ms. 
M.  Davi, 8th grade, and Ms. F. Davi High School.  .  
Starting November 2nd, Brooklyn Studio will be offering a strategy targeted after school 
enrichment program.  This program will be offered to all ELLs, especially for students who are 
at risk for Promotion in Doubt.   During this after-school tutoring, the teacher targets the students 
needs and supports them in the classroom.  The ENL teachers supplement with the two new 
programs purchased with this money.  Program #1 - Brainpop - ENL subscription Reading 
program and Program #2 - ENL reading smart program students are able to utilize the IPADS 
and use the program for enrichment.  The TESOL certified teachers will Push-in with the content 
area teachers.  The max of each session will be no more than 15 students.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
Dates:  Every Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays starting November 2nd until the end of the 
year. 
Every Saturday starting January 7th until June 22th : 9:00AM-12:00PM  
This enrichment program will be after-school and offered to our Title III ELL population 
only.  The ENL teachers will be integrating with the content area teachers licensed in ELA, 
Math, Social Studies, and Science.  The ENL teachers will be there the whole time.  The Title III 
will fund the ENL teachers stipend for this enrichment activity.   
OTPS: *  Consumable Workbooks 
            *Bilingual textbooks 
            *Dictionaries 
            *Folders, pens, paper, notebooks, and any other supplies to support ELL instruction and 
strategies 
            *IPADs set just for the after-school/Saturday school program to assist in supporting the 
Enrichment for the ELLs.     
Brooklyn Studio plans to purchase iPads with Title III funding.  In addition to our ELLs being 
able to use IPADS during their, students are able to come to ROOM 211 after school and use 
IPADs to assist with translation, homework, and projects.  All learning will be a tactile, tangible, 
and interactive.  Additionally, from a classroom environment standpoint, the immediacy of 
information in a non-threatening, non-disruptive manner is key in developing comprehension for 
ELL students.  The iPads form factor, being a single slate design, does not create a physical 
barrier between the teacher and the ELL student and thus provides a more open learning 
environment.  Another positive feature is the iPads operating system which allows only a single 
application can be open at a time minimizing possible distractions. 
The objective in providing the iPad is to provide ELL students with current technology that will 
allow them to access thousands of learning applications. This access will positively impact their 
English language acquisition in ways that would not be afforded to them on conventional 
computing devices.  The unique ability of the iPad is that it allows students and instructors to the 
newest and most advanced applications that are being developed every day.  Beyond the 
multitude of iPad exclusive opportunities, students will also be able to leverage the iPad to 
enhance their learning with the iPad’s ability to access a standard suite of learning tools such as: 
translation applications, software for English, reading and mathematics, Internet for research 
purposes, word processing and presentation software, and to obtain the necessary 21st Century 
skills needed to be successful inside and outside of the traditional educational settings. Being that 
the iPad is a fully immersive piece of technology, it will ultimately help ELL students to interact 
without language barriers and become more competitive in an advancing digital world.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
One of the ways that early literacy is assessed is by administering the NYSITELL/Spanish LAB to determine ELLs levels in 
reading, writing, listening, and speaking.  This data provides teachers the ELLs proficiency in each skill, whether it be in English 
or their Native Language.  This helps the school program ENL students to ensure they get the correct number of minutes.  Also, 
it gives the school an insight on what support is needed for these newcomers.  Brooklyn Studio has given the Interim 
Assessment for all ELLs and will analyze all data on November 3  rd  .  This assessment measures their literacy levels and 
writing skills.      
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The ELLs’ success is evaluated by examining city, state, and school-wide assessments.  The results are observed by the ELL 
team, ELA and content area teachers.  In the high school, it is noted that over 60% of the ELLs that took the ELA, Global, and US 
History regents passed.  However, it was obvious when taking the exam in their native language, results were higher.  In the 
middle school, data showed that the ELLs here longer than three years received a high 2 or higher on the ELA exam.  Most ELLs 
received a 2 or higher in Math.       
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
n/a   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Looking at NYSESLAT and NYSITELL data, we realize that these exams reveal that most ELLs have difficulty in reading and 
writing.  Furthermore, writing seems to be the hardest skill to master for all ELLs(newcomers and long-term ELLs).  The results 
show that the Urdu, Arabic, Sife, and long-term ELLs struggle the most all four skills. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Brooklyn Studio provides a Freestanding ENL program and the ENL instruction is delivered by Ms. Davi, Ms. Blutstein, 
and Ms. Frontino during the school day.  All ELLs are served in their ELA classes by all three teachers:  Ms. Frontino 
6th, 10th, and 11th grade, Ms. Davi 7th grade, and Ms. Blutstein 6th  and10th grade.  All beginning and intermediate 
middle school students are pulled out during their talent classes for further ENL service.  All beginner high school 
students have an additional two periods ENL services and all intermediate are scheduled for one period. In the ENL 
classes, the ELLs are grouped heterogeneously and are taught by the licensed ENL teachers. Push-in support is given in 
the middle school during English Language Arts.     

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A  

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

              Currently, Brooklyn Studio is a 6-12 school.  There are 11 6th graders, 12 7th graders, 22 8th graders, 39 9th graders, 
18 10th graders, 12 11th graders, and 4 12th graders.  Of the 118 ELLs at the school there are 70 newcomers, 25 developing 
ELLs, and 23 long term ELLs 13 of which are SWD..  Under CR Part 154, in the High school, entering ELLs  receive 540 minutes of 
ENL instruction per week, and they have total of 15 periods(each period is 45 minutes) from Monday to Friday; the emerging 
ELLs receive 360 minutes of ESL instruction per week, and they have a total of 10 periods of ENL from Monday to Friday, and 
the transitioning and expanding ELLs receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction per week, and they have a total of 5 periods from 
Monday to Friday.  In addition, the transitioning and expanding ELLs receive 180 minutes of ELA instruction per week  All 
ELLs  have a regular schedule  for ENL classes and for content area classes. 
a. Depending on their proficiency level, all the ELLs receive from 180 minutes to 540 minutes a week of self-contained ENL 
instruction and/or Push in the content areas.     
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
      In order to help the students progress, we utilize  the following practices: 
    - Collaboration between ENL and content area teachers 
    - Scaffolding teaching and learning for ELLs in the content area classrooms 
    - Differentiating instruction for ELLs and providing extra support during work periods 
    - Additional small group sessions for ELLs before all state assessments 
    - Use of graphic organizers and visual aids  
    - Focus on academic literacy and language  
    - Use of bilingual glossaries  
    - Use of Ipads  
Content area teachers meet regularly with the ENL teachers to discuss strategies for teaching ELLs.  They monitor the students' 
learning and provide them with bilingual glossaries to help them access content. In addition, the buddy system in the content 
area classrooms enable the ELLs to exchange ideas and skills in both their native language and in English.     
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

      Brooklyn Studio does not have a bilingual program, therefore the Spanish Lab is given to Spanish speakers and where 
possible, a native speaker staff member, together with the certified ENL teacher, assess the newcomer.    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

The ELL subgroups include SIFE students and newcomers who have been in US schools for less than three years, ELLs who have 
been receiving ENL services for 4 to 6 years, the Long-Term ELL,s and ELLs identified as having special needs. 
a. Plan for SIFE-- to provide academic intervention services as an extension of the regular school program; to design 
individualized student study plan and to provide native language support whenever feasible. 
b. Plan for newcomers-- when a new student is registered at Brooklyn Studio, we provide the following resources to facilitate 
the transition: 
    - an informal student orientation 
    - use the buddy system to help ease transition 
    - small group instruction to teach "survival English" and content specific language 
    - additional support to help them get ready for formal assessment 
                  - use of Ipads 
        - students are given biligual glossaries for each content 
c. Plan for Developing ELLs:  
    - analyze the data from NYSESLAT and baseline assessments to find the strengths and weaknesses of each student. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

    - differentiate instruction to meet their needs for learning 
    - intensive  practice in reading and writing   
d. Plan for Long-term ELLs:  
    - Analyze their performance data to understand them and device strategies to help them 
    - Provide them with the after school programs 
    - Provide them with support to enrich their language and academic skills 
e.  Plan for former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status: 
    -  Former ELLs receive testing accomodations for up to two years.  These accomodations include:  bilingual dictionaries and 
glossaries,  time and a half, separate location and a third ELA reading.    
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 Plan for Special Needs Student : 
    - ensure that all teacher are familiar with the IEP mandates  
    - know the students' special needs    
 - collaboration between the ENL teacher and IEP contact person. Brooklyn Studio provides a Freestanding English as a New 
Language (ENL) program and the ENL instruction  is delivered by the teachers, the licsenced ENL teacher.  
    - SEC and SESIS reports   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
ELL-SWDs receive ENL support in English Language Arts or in the ENL pull out classes. In addition, their IEPs are analized to get 
a better understanding in which content based classes they need the extra support.  Special education teachers and ENL 
teachers try to make content accessible via various access points and differentiating when needed, allowing our students to 
reach their goals.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Information gathered from ongoing assessment of students in a variety of environments, conversations, and tangible 
assignments are used to plan professional development sessions.  A collaborative effort between Social Studies, English, 
Science, and Mathematics instructors has resulted in curriculum and instruction specifically reflective of the respective themes 
and ideas studied in grade 6-12.  Saturday school is offered starting in January.  All three ENL teachers work with ELLs to help 
prepare for state exams in English, Math, Science, and Social Studies.  Middle-school ELLs are pulled out for 
instruction.  Content subjects are reviewed with ENL strategies.  In-house PD sessions focus on content enhancement 
techniques, portfolio development and assessment, generative word lists, and curriculum development with the mindset of 
being an ELL student. Additionally, teachers are given last period every Friday to collaborate about assessment-driven, student-
driven instruction.  ENL and subject area teachers are involved in a variety of staff development activities that ensure the 
successful implementation of instructional strategies.  Such as Professional Development given through the Office of English 
Language Learners.  (Qtel training, standard Core curriculum, and ENL strategies for Math and Science.)      
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Brooklyn Studio has been using Codex in the middle school ELA classes and this year we have introduced Collections to our 
high school ELA classes.  The ENL team has been trained for Codex and will be trained in Collections.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A    
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

All activities are availble to all ELLs and former ELLs.  Currently, more than a third of the band members are ELLs/former 
ELLs.  This motivation has been driven by Ms. Mannino and Mr. Kirshner (Music certified).  The ELLs feel extremely comfortable 
in band because they are able to express themselves equally with the non-ELLs.  Our ELLs are invited and encouraged to be 
involved in programs/Clubs like Big Brother/Big Sister,  Chess, Student Government Committees, and various other programs 
offered at Brooklyn Studio.  Ms. Mannino and the ENL teachers explain all the programs to all the ELLs in the beginning of the 
year and encourages the students to participate.  Supplementary Services provided are Saturday and after-school tutoring that 
meets the needs of our English Language Learners.  All ELLs and former ELLs throughout our school population considered at 
risk, taking Regents, ELA, and/or Math state exams are recommended for attendance.       
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Instructional materials that are used at Brooklyn Studio include the following:  Bilingual dictionaries, bilingual content 
glossaries, English dictionaries, laptops, Ipads school supplies (given to each student, ex. flashcards, flashdrives, highlighters, 
rulers, calculators, notebooks etc), subject textbooks,  and personal copies of current literature ELA pieces.  We have 
purchased iPads with Title III money so that teachers/students will be able to use during classes as translators for 
clarification.  ELLs are aware that Room 206 is designated as their room and is supplied with laptops, ipads, glossaries, 
dictionaries and other resources.    
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Brooklyn Studio supports native language in the ENL model by:  providing translators when needed, buddy system, and use of 
bilingual dictionaries and glossaries.    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Brooklyn Studio believes in instructing and providing mandated services in grouping of profiency levels.     
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Instructional materials that are used at Brooklyn Studio include the following:  Bilingual dictionaries, bilingual content 
glossaries, English dictionaries, laptops, Ipads school supplies (given to each student, ex. flashcards, flashdrives, highlighters, 
rulers, calculators, notebooks etc), subject textbooks,  and personal copies of current literature ELA pieces.  We have 
purchased iPads with Title III money so that teachers/students will be able to use during classes as translators for 
clarification.  ELLs are aware that Room 206 is designated as their room and is supplied with laptops, ipads, glossaries, 
dictionaries and other resources.    
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
An orientation is offered before school begins to new incoming students.  This orientation tours the school and explains the 
students their program.  Students attend a Title III summer school enrichment program at Lafayette HS.      
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Italian, Spanish. And Sign Language are offered at Brooklyn Studio from grades 7-12 only to former and Advanced ELLs.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
ENL and subject area teachers are involved in a variety of staff development activities that ensure the successful 
implementation of instructional strategies that enhance the education of ELLs.  These activities include monthly department 
conferences and bulletins.  Inter-visitation of classes, demonstration lessons, observations, meeting with ELL Instructional 
Support Specialists, and school-based staff developers.  The ENL team attend various PDs offered through OELL throughout the 
school year.  Furthermore, all three teachers will be signing up for Content-based instruction strategies for ELLs and Common 
Core State standards for ELLs. Other staff members like assistant principals, subject area teachers, secretaries, and parent 
coordinator will be offered a PD on ENL Strategies.        
See number 1.    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Ms. Mannino supports the staff members by distributing a snapshot of each ELL.  The snapshot includes the students' 
proficiency level, native language, and years in the country.  Ms. Mannino also describes the ELL accomodations of time and 
half on exams, separate location, and the use of bilingual dictionaries.        
Our assistant principal Agnese Fezzuoglio keeps a Professional Development binder in her office.  In this binder, she has a log 
of all staff members (Parent Coordinator, secretaries, teachers, para-professionals, psychologists, counselors) that attend 
Professional Development.  The binder includes, attendance, description of PD, and the PD agenda.      
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Paste response to question here:    

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

A monthly PTA meeting is held at Brooklyn Studio.  All parents are invited and encouraged to attend.  All ELL parents receive 
letters in their native languages and English for these meetings.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Andrea Ciliotta, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Brooklyn Studio analyzes the Language Report off ATS to distinguish the different languages needed for translated 
material and oral interpetation. For important events like parent-teacher conferences, orientation, PTA , and IEP 
meetings, translators are provided in all languages needed. Teachers, secretaries, administration, and all other 
staff use the DOE phone interpertation service.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.
