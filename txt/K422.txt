Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7 

 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our school was founded with a mission and a vision to serve the needs of the whole student, to promote 
collaboration amongst stakeholders in service of student learning, and develop a deeply differentiated and targeted 
curriculum and culture that meets the needs of each individual child.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Spring Creek Community School is located in Brooklyn’s District 19; the vast majority of our students qualify for free 
or reduced lunch, over 50 percent of our population enters 6th grade as part of the citywide lowest third 
demographic, and over 75% of our students enter our school performing significantly under grade level in Math and 
ELA.  

 

Collaboration, inquiry, authentic assessment, and differentiation are the key practices that inform our work with our 
students, families, and each other. Our founding staff and administration deeply believe that teachers must 
constantly and consistently assess and track student needs, progress, and mastery of skills and standards to inform 
professional reflection, drive instruction, and inform professional communication, collaboration, and strategic 
decision making. A school whose systems, structures, leadership roles, and pedagogical practices are aligned with this 
cycle of teaching, learning, and inquiry is one which best supports student achievement and ensures autonomy and 
access to choice in our students’ adult lives. As teachers engage in these best practices, they acquire and utilize both 
qualitative and quantitative knowledge about students; as this information is key to making decisions and choices that 
have the most impact on student learning and progress, it is vital that teachers have an authentic voice and role in 
leading the work we do as a school community.  

Our belief in the value of collaborative and distributed leadership, and its impact on student learning, is manifest in 
our core structures and systems. Our schedule and allocation of resources are strategically designed to maximize 
teacher collaboration, capacity for leadership, and the development of a professional learning culture. The majority of 
teachers (exceeding 85%) at SCCS teach in a scheduled program that maximizes opportunities for collaboration and 
staff-driven professional supports, and multiple teachers assume semi-formal leadership roles in running and 
facilitating teacher teams, schoolwide initiatives, PD series, and intervisitation cycles. Over 50% of teachers sit on a 
cabinet/committee in a leadership or consultative capacity. Teachers have access to budget information, and use 
templates to submit proposals aligned with school goals for budgetary allocations; over 90% of current staff, 
individually or in teacher teams, have submitted and had approved a budgetary proposal. Teachers engage in regular 
self- and school needs assessments and reflections, including feedback cycles to inform administrative and school-
level decision making. 

Our goal is to support our students in their growth toward becoming lifelong creative and critical thinkers, 
compassionate citizens, and problem-solvers with agency and autonomy in their adult lives. When a student chooses 
to walk away from a conflict, and return to the mediation table later to resolve it with minimal input from a staff 
member; when an Advisory develops a proposal and formal presentation for administration to seek permission to 
develop and run a school-wide initiative; when a student applies the learning they have mastered in the classroom to 
a real-life problem (and explains to their teachers and peers how they did it the next day); when a student is able to 
reflect on the feedback they received on an ELA essay and apply it to improve their next effort in Social Studies; these 
are all examples that have been shared at our weekly staff meetings as evidence of our students’ success, and 
represent what we believe is authentic and lifelong learning. The value of a 6-12 school model is that it allows staff,

students, families, and partners to work together for 7 years to support our students in leaving us ready for college, 
career, and self-empowered to have and make choices that will shape his or her life. 

 

SCCS prioritizes enrichment opportunities within and beyond the school day, and our recruitment strategies, 
allocation of resources, and Professional Development are all aligned with this goal, and our partnerships with 
outside organizations to provide academic, cultural, and socio-emotional support and resources to students 
include The Shubert Foundation/Broadway Junior, Pathways to Leadership, Generation Ready, Brooklyn 
Public Library, BRIC Arts, Citizen Science, Center for the Arts, and Urban Advantage.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Approximately 30% of student population has an IEP in ICT or SETTS settings; approximately 2% of school population 
are English Language Learners. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

We have made progress in all Framework areas according to our CEP goals from last year. We successfully onboarded 
and supported a new cohort of teachers (as we added another grade) who successfully submitted and implemented 
curriculum and lessons that were 100% aligned to Common Core Learning and New York Standards, as per our 
Collaborative Teachers goal. Our key areas of focus for the year are to increase student achievement on state/Regents 
exams with a particular focus on the subgroup of Students with IEPs.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans  

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, 
and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious 
intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support) 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice 
Tenet 3 Statement of Practice 
Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan. 
3.2 

The school leader ensures and supports the quality implementation of a systematic plan of 
rigorous and coherent curricula appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning 
Standards (CCLS) that is monitored and adapted to meet the needs of students. 
Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction 
(DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and 
address student achievement needs. 
The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner 
within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the 
arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities. 
Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative 
assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student 
reflection, tracking of, and ownership of learning.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Quality Review in 2018-2019 rated 19K422 Proficient in 1.1 & 1.2, and Well-Developed in 2.2 (Aligning assessments to 
curricula, use on-going assessment and grading practices, and analyze information on student learning outcomes to 
adjust instructional decisions at the team and classroom levels) . As our collaborative professional culture and practices 
around data inquiry and assessment are a foundation of our existing effective structures, our goal is to sustain their 
effectiveness as we grow throughout our high school, and expand our resources/capacity to further establish these 
structures and practices as a growing 6-12 school. 

 

Staff reflections, curricular review, Inquiry with data trends and Quality Review/PPO feedback, and consultation with 
parent groups/ SLT indicated that teacher team communication and collaboration is an existing area of strength, and is 
the foundation for best practices in impacting student achievement. 2016 Framework for Great Schools report identifies 
strong areas in CCLS shifts in literacy and math, and PPO and QR feedback identify areas of potential growth as 
increasing access for subgroups and accelerated learners. 19K422 received a Focus School designation based on 2014-
2015 Middle School exam scores; further inquiry and disaggregation of data identifies student subgroup performance on 
Middle School math exams as determining data set in this designation. Our performance on State Exams in the 2015-

2016 school year qualified 19K422 for the first of two years meeting performance benchmarks to be removed from the 
Focus list, which indicates strategies and resource allocation in the 2015-2016 school year, and that were continued in 
the 16-17 school year, were successful. While the approval of ESSA resets all designations for the 2018-2019 year, 
internal data indicates that this remains an area for us to prioritize. 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
 

Our school will increase the strategic and structured use of formative data from multiple sources to drive planning & 
instruction; impact of which will be evidenced in a minimum of 3% increase in our Special Education students’ 
performance on Middle School Math exams toward AYP targets by June 2019, using state/city-provided data on prior 
performance as a baseline from which to measure growth.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 

2018-2019 School Survey Data shows that 95% of families say their child is safe at school, and 93% of families say that 
teachers and families think of each other as partners when educating their children. Our end of year SLT S/CEP planning 
session in Spring 2018 identified positive and safe school culture as an area of high satisfaction for parents/guardians 
and families, but also identified as a goal to increase student participation and voice in expanded arenas. The SLT also 
identified increased opportunities for educating and engaging families around our Restorative Justice and Culturally 
Responsive Eeducatin (CRE) practices as a prioity for the 2018-2019 school year. During the 2015-2016, 19K422 piloted a 
series of Restorative Justice (RJ) trainings and pilot circles/restorative projects for staff and students, with anecdotal 
impact and observable increase in professional conversations and strategy implementation around alternative 
approaches to student intervention, discipline, and support. Our goals as a scvhool community is to integrate and make 
transparent and accessible our community conversations and work in this area to families as well.

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools –Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
 

By June 2019 we will have held a minimum of two Restorative Justice workshops for staff, for students, and for families, 
with 100% participation of staff and students, and at least 8 families represented at each family workshop, ensuring 
each school stakeholder group has access to information and training around our school's initiative. By June 2019, as a 
result of the implementation of at least two Restorative Justice workshops, there will be a 5% decrease in the number of 
suspensions and incidents, as measured by the 2018-2019 OORS report, compared to the number of suspensions and 
incidents, as measured by the 2017-2018 OORS report.

  Evidence-based instructional programs, 

 

professional development, and/or systems and 
structures needed to impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other 
high-need student subgroups (e.g., 
overage/under-credited, SIFE, STH). 

Restorative Justice (RJ) structures and practices are a key 
focus for schoolwide planning and PD, including the 
following: 

-Multiple teachers will be programmed for daily 
RJ/Mentoring periods to implement processing, reflection, 
and mediation circles with targeted groups of students. 

- A full-time RJ coordinator will continue work with staff to 
implement RJ practices and approaches/alternatives. 

-Schoolwide PD calendar will embed a minimum of once-
monthly partial or full PD sessions around building capacity 
and skills in implementation. 

In conjunction with Community School CBO P2L, 19K422 
will continue to implement and expand a comprehensive, 
interest-based menu of After School (AS) activities aligned 
with both academic and enrichment objectives; program 
will expand within first trimester to include Saturday 
programs. 

Community/Culture Teams, including stakeholders from all 
community groups (teachers, Parent Coordinator, 
Administration, Grade Team leaders, on-site CBO partner, 
parents, students) will collaborate and provide input into 
establishing a Culture Calendar around events, assemblies, 
celebrations, both during and beyond the school-day, that 
increase opportunities for all stakeholder groups to engage 
in activity and conversation around various objectives, 
including building positive and supportive campus and 
school culture. Thought will be given to differentiating 
between MS and HS needs (i.e., strategically scheduling 
events that are separate to address developmentally 
different needs, along with opportunities for the full 6-12 
community to come together), addressing needs of 
statistically significant subgroups (ensuring adapted and/or

our teaching staff will need significant support until we reach full capacity by 2019. Currently, at least 50% of our 
teaching staff will be in their 1st four years of their practice, which indicates that our staff still continues to need 
significant support and growth in pedagogical practices. The staff will require intensive support to ensure curriculum is

2017-2018 School Survey Data indicates parents have a high level of satisfaction around inclusive leadership (92%), and 
94% of teachers say the principal communicates a clear vision for this school. At May 2018 SLT S/CEP planning meeting, 
family stakeholders and identified collaboration and feedback as an area of satisfaction, and increase in additional 
opportunities for parents to participate in community life, and increased opportunities for students to have voice, as 
areas for desired goal-setting. In end of year conferences and reflections with teachers and teacher teams, teachers 
indicated a high level of satisfaction with admin-teacher relationships but also indicated that an increase in direct 
involvement by administration in teacher planning and pedagogical growth would be welcome. The 2017-18 school 
survey, only 56% of teachers surveyed indicated that "the principal participates in instructional planning with teacher 
teams." 

As a growing school, students, staff, and family input is essential to ensure system and program development 
authentically meets the needs of, and is responsive to/in dialogue with, community needs, and is aligned with school 
mission of critical pedagogy and commitment to distributed leadership and representative of all stakeholders' voices. In 
2013, 19K422 implemented an ongoing access protocol for community members to provide feedback around resource 
allocation; budget proposal templates require submitters to align proposals with the citywide Framework for Great

Schools, the CCLS/Danielson rubrics, and/or the Quality Review Rubric. In the 2017-2018 school year, 100% of staff 
submitted and had approved at least one budget proposal (individually or collectively as part of a teacher team 
submission); and two student groups did as well. At the end of year SLT S/CEP planning session, all stakeholders 
identified this as a practice that increases input and communication about resources and access, and identified as a 
practice with potential for expansion. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.  
School will increase Effective School Leadership through a focus on administration-teacher collaboration on instructional 
initiatives, as measured by a 10% increase on the 2018-19 school survey teacher question regarding principal 
participation in instructional planning with teacher teams and the submission of budget proposals from 100% of 
teachers by June 2018, either individually or as teacher teams.

 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
Staff reflections, curricular review, Inquiry with data trends and Quality Review/PPO feedback, and consultation 
with parent groups/ SLT indicated that an area of growth, especially as we enter our first full year at capacity as 
a 6-12,to develop our existing systems and structures to encourage and empower student voice. 2017-2018 
indicates that parents have a high level of trust in principal, teachers, and their access to decision-making (over 
90% of parents indicated satisfaction with Inclusive leadership, teacher-parent trust, and principal-parent trust); 
positive relationships and open lines of communication can be leveraged and maximized to increase information 
sharing in developing curriculum, programs, and community resources that meet student and parent needs.  

Our end of year SLT S/CEP planning session in Spring 2018 identified positive and safe school culture as an area of high 
satisfaction for parents/guardians and families, but also identified as a goal to increase student participation and voice 
in expanded arenas. After spending SLT meeting time performing inquiry with the results of the 2016-2017 school 
survey, Parents expressed frustration about the quality or clarity of DOE student survey questions and wording, which 
prompted several SLT meetings throughout the 2017-2018 school year to examine our survey results, other kinds of 
surveys, and begin crafting our own that would elicit the data about student concerns, ideas, and needs that would be 
more clear and actionable. Parents identified developing and administering a survey as an SLT, with follow-up student 
focus groups, as a goal for the 1st semester of the next school year. The information collected would then be used to

drive budget proposal drafting around an SLT-driven initiative that aligned with our data findings. In addition, on the 
2017-18 school survey, "72% of students say that their teachers will always listen to students' ideas," and "81% of 
students say that there is at least one adult in the school that they can confide in," which further supported the idea 
that a priority focus for stakeholders was developing opportunities to solicit information and feedback from students, 
and create further opportunities for students to develop agency and ownership in the larger school community. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.  
In order to increase student voice and agency in school and community affairs, SCCS and the SLT will implement a series 
of student-driven surveys and initiatives. The effectiveness of this goal and its implementation will be measured by a 
minimum of a 5% increase on the 2018-19 school survey in student response to the question, "72% of students say that 
their teachers will always listen to students' ideas," and a minimum 5% increase in student response to the survey 
question "81 % of students say there is at least one adult in the school that they can confide in."

§ Rigorous instructional strategies 

 

SCCS participates in the following DOE initiatives, which provide comprehensive resources, teacher training, PD 
opportunities, and various forms of on-site coaching: Algebra for All, AP for All, Middle and High School College Access 
for All. 

Lead teachers attend monthly trainings in content and pedagogy with representatives from the Superintendent's 
team, and turnkey professional learnings to their teams in weekly meetings. 

Teachers work with various coaches and consultants (including representatives from our partner organizations, BRIC 
Arts, The Shubert Foundation, Brooklyn Public Library, Urban Advantage, Citizen Science, Pathways to Leadership) as 
well as coaches from Generation Ready and the Leadership Academy, in and out of the classroom to develop 
structures, strategies and instructional methods that target specific content/skill standards 

  Grade Teams and Department Teams are each programmed to meet 1-2 times per week and submit meetings 

and work/inquiry products to administration for review; Department Leaders and Grade Team leaders meet 
with administration weekly to build capacity, consult on systems/institutional practice, and implement PD 
calendars and plans school-wide. 

o Teachers have access to CCLS- and NYS Exam-Aligned Performance Series to design assessments tailored to ongoing 
assessment of student needs, and use data to drive instructional planning and curriculum development. Scantron 
technology and assessment-development software assists teachers in designing assessments to target areas of 
student need and growth. 

o Teachers have access to professional developments in the area of alternate assessment, socio-emotional support 
strategies, and instructional strategies for high-needs students. 

o Teachers in all content areas and disciplines attend off-site Professional Developments throughout the year, and 
turnkey their learnings to Departments and Grade Teams in regular meetings. 

o SCCS was identified as a DOE "Showcase School" for the 2017-2018 school year, which will continue in the 2018-
2019 school year, when we will onboard two additional "Showcase Fellows," teacher-leaders who will drive and 
facilitate the planning and execution of related events, facilitations, and materials/resources.

o 19K422 applied to be, and was approved for, a PROSE school designation, to modify programs and structures to 
maximize teacher ability to plan, meet, and engage in Professional Development in service of professional growth and 
meeting student needs. 

  19K422 was asked to serve as an official NYC DOE Training Academy in 2016-2017 as a hub for new teacher 

development for NYC Public Schools, which will continue in the 2018-2019 Spring Semester. A team of 
teacher leaders applied, and were accepted, to be site coaches; teacher coaches receive professional 
development specifically geared toward growing capacity and improving practice in colleagues, and mentor 
student teachers from multiple training programs in the city on-site. 

 

All teachers meet in Departments, mentorship pairings, and co-teaching partnerships as part of their Professional 
period programs; these meetings are run by Teacher Leaders who meet regularly with administration to debrief 
emerging staff needs, engage in reflection and feedback about best practices and PLC goal-setting, and collaborate in 
designing ongoing PD structures and foci that support the growth of a diverse teaching staff.

common assessments is a priority of the year’s Professional development schedule. Departments meet to develop a 
year-long calendar of assessments, data inquiry, and goal-setting/tracking, aligned with individual departmental 
multi-year Scope and Sequences, and Department Leaders and Grade Team Leaders advise administration on 
authentic calendars for data inquiry and tracking cycles to regularly assess instructional and school-wide impact on 
student learning. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           53 

 
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities

funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG or SIF funds: These funds 

must be used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant 
application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Spring Creek Community School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Spring Creek Community School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           56 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           57 

 

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning or evening, to share 
information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and allow parents to 
provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing an online resource for parents and families via the school website, including links to academic supports, 
and instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;

Addendum: Community School Partnerships 

Directions: The Community School (CS) strategy is directly aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. Community 
Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and 
family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in 
Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & 
Wellness. 
 
Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s) 

How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student 
academic outcomes?  
The CS strategy utilizes the core services to provide a holistic approach to supporting our students in their academic 
success. From the health and wellness perspective, we utilize guidance counselors, social workers and social work 
interns to provide socioemotional support. We additionally utilize a restorative justice approach for additional 
socioemotional support and development, which is shaped by our restorative justice coordinator. From the family 
engagement perspective, we work closely with the parent coordinator and parent association to create programming 
and resources that meet the needs of our diverse families. Additionally, we utilize newsletters to improve our reach 
beyond traditional communication methods. In terms of expanded learning time, we provide SONYC afterschool 
programming, as well as sports offerings. Additionally, we provide targeted test preparation and before school 
educational services to supplement traditional offerings. In terms of attendance supports, we employ an attendance 
team comprised of different stakeholders which conferences on attendance percentages and red flags weekly.  

 
Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to 
be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
In the 18-19 school year, SCCS aims to further embody our role as a community school by improving our overall 
culture, engaging our students and families in socioemotional development, and improving their access to necessary 
resources.

Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s): 
How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family 
Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students? 
We intend to improve upon our ELT offerings to better encompass the interests and needs of our students. In doing 
so, we improve the connection our students have to their school. We will be thoroughly case conferencing our 
students who are flagged for their attendance and connecting them to suitable resources and socioemotional 
supports. We will be offering better targeted resources to our families and improving upon our outreach methods. In 
doing so, we improve the connection our families have to the school community. We will also be improving our 
overall socioemotional intervention processes including supports for families as a whole.  

These efforts that support achieving our goals are directly aligned with supporting the academic goals of our students. 
Students and families who feel connected to their school are less likely to dropout or experience chronic absenteeism. 
Additionally, the further students and families progress in their socioemotional development and learning, the better 
equipped they are to address the barriers that hinder the ability to achieve academic goals.

Community Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and 
together with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will 
lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating 
activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work. 
Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and 
services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time 
(ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the 
right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly 
coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day. 
Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to 
strengthen this initiative. 
Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and 
families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of

their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community 
School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement 
strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use. 
Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work. 

The lead CBO in partnership with the community school hired a new community school director in March of 2018. 
The community school director was able to conduct ongoing needs and asset assessments. Additionally, this 
community school director organized the forum where parents were able to address concerns they have identified in 
a discussion format. The information obtained from assessment processes will be utilized to plan sy18-19 
programming in a way that best addresses the needs identified with the assets available.  

Students presenting socio-emotional challenges are identified through our referral process. They are then provided 
supportive services in a variety of formats. The majority of these formats are offered on-site to alleviate time and 
travel constraints. The referral process will be re evaluated to determine how we will address students who may pass 
under the radar. We currently provide the students we’ve identified with the right services; however, we are working 
to expand who the “right students” are for the support we can either provide or refer out to. 

After school services are aligned with instructional programming through the use of a knowledgeable educational 
specialist. We currently offer a healthy spread of after school programming. However, we are working to improve our 
outreach efforts to better inform the school community of our offerings. We will be implementing an additional 
opportunity for ELT through the use of an on-site mentorship program. The program will provide learning 
opportunities that supplement day time instruction. Additionally, this program will help to target students who 
haven’t felt connected to ELT options currently available. Lastly, we will be working to improve the offerings we have 
for high school aged students, as we do not currently have a formal high school level after school program. These 
targeted efforts will help to ensure that there are fulfilling options for all students to take part in. 

 

The style of forum which we previously used will be revamped. Data will be continuously collected at parent 
engagement events including our resource fair and parent-teacher conference events. Additionally, a forum will be 
conducted once mid-year, and again at the end of the year. These forums will be incorporated into parent association 
meetings to improve turnout and depth of parent voice. The information obtained from all these methods will be 
relayed directly to principals via the SLT.  

The attendance team meets weekly to analyze data and case conference students. The New Visions Data Sorter is 
used to provide useful context information during conferencing. The ATS system is also utilized. We will improve upon 
this practice by providing more case management as opposed to case conferencing of students.  

 

The community school team will meet monthly and analyze SONYC after school attendance data, information 
provided via the data sorter, and the level of parent engagement measured via communication platforms, and 
attendance tracking.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
At Spring Creek Community School all  ESL instruction is data driven through NYSESLAT modality analysis, Measures of Student 
Learning Exams and Teacher Created Assessments. Assessment and data is collected and analyzed on a regular basis by 
administration, departments, ESL teacher, and consultants. This data that is collected helps us compile information that is used 
to further shape the pace and form of instruction for ELA, ESL and all literacy-based approaches through periodic goals set by 
the teachers. SCCS classrooms contain leveled libraries, genre libraries,word walls, software tools, translation programs, and 
other resources to help make content comprehensible for ELLs. 
 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           68 

 

In the classroom, the data is used to group students for targeted small group instruction.  In addition, the data is used to plan 
for individual conferences and whole class mini lessons. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
At SCCS, ELL success is measured through a variety of formal and informal assessments, including, but not limited to Interim 
Assessments, reading conferences, weekly quizes and exams, progress reports, classwork, homework, and participation scores. 
Project-based learning is assessed through a system of rubrics and reflective evaluations that emphasize higher-ordered 
metacognitive abilities. Basic Interpersonal Communicative Skills (BICS) and Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency Skills 
(CALPS) are assessed on a weekly basis in the course of push-in instruction and pull-out instruction through conferencing and 
oral assessment activities.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
We currently have 6-9th graders   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
NYSESLAT and LAB-R reports validate SCCS's emphasis on literacy building through project based learning that emphasizes 
content-rich instruction.  Students are taught explicit strategies to improve reading endurance and writing volume.  Patterns 
reveal the challenge SCCS has to improve reading and writing levels across all grade levels. 
 
The results of the LAB-R indicate the students enlish proficiency level and help SCCS develop a plan for delivering ESL services 
and how much intervention services students will need.  The data patterns revealed that many students who have been 
receiving services for four years or more are making signigicant gains on the various modalities presented on the 
NYSESLAT.  Lastly, the data revealed that our population of ELLs mostly scored EXPANDING in reading, writing, and speaking 
with the exception of 2 students.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).

 Students in freestanding ENL program are instructed in English with support in native language to the extent possible. 
English Language Arts content is delivered in general education classes during the ELL's ELA period.  The content team 
teachers and the 
teacher who is servicing the students meet weekly to discuss units, lesson plans, and plans for differentiated 
instruction.  Differentiated instruction is supported by ESL services and content team teachers.  Content is enriched 
through the use of socially constructed project-based learning activities, capable of addressing variations in learning 
styles and modalities through a variety of SIOP and CALLA-based strategies. All students are Advanced, with the 
exception of 2 so all lessons are administered in the English language through the class periods.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

SCCS staff is organized around grade and content teams with the content teacher and ESL coordinator participating in all 
instructional decisions as equal team members. 
a. ESL services are delivered throughout the day explicitly during various content periods. The students work with content area 
teachers to ensure comprehension, re-teaching material, and assessing ELLs formally and informally during class periods. 
Explicit ESL instructional minutes are delivered as push-in units and pull-out units. ELLs are grouped in one class per grade 
level, facilitating schedules between the ESL teacher and their students.  EXPANDING  ELL students receive 180 minutes a week 
in a push-In & pull-out model. While EMERGING  & ENTERING students receive 360 minutes a week.  Students make up their 
minutes throughout the day by either the ESL teacher pushing in or pulling out the students. 
 
SCCS is in compliance with all State and City mandates in regards to time allotments for ESL instruction.  
 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
English  Languange Arts content is delivered in general education classes during the ELL's ELA period.  The content team 
teachers and the teacher that is working with the ESL students meet weekly to discuss units, lesson plans, and plans for 
differentiated instruction.  Differentiated instruction is supported by ESL services and content team teachers.  Content is 
enriched through the use of socially constructed project-based learning activities, capable of addressing variations in learning 
styles and modalities through a variety of SIOP and CALLA-based strategies. All students are EXPANDING with the exception of 
two students, so all lessons are administered in the English language throught the class periods.  
 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native language based on responses to parent interviews, language choice for NYC 
DOE DVD and student choices. Students are Advanced, so they prefer to receive all exams in the English language.

e. 

Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. Spring Creek Community School currently does not have any SIFE students, however, if we had any SIFE students, the  ESL 
provider would provide supplement ESL strategies for the SIFE students primarily through targeted small group instruction 
within the 
push-in model. During this time, the ESL provider and content team teachers will work with the SIFE students individually and 
in small 
groups to bridge gaps in their skill base using a variety of Q-Tel-derived differentiation strategies and Wilson phonics skill 
building 
exercises. 
b. We currently do not have any new ELL students, however,  instruction would focus on developing their literacy skills in their 
native 
language.  Instruction would be consistent with New York State and New York City performance guidelines and standards.  In 
the 
push-in model, the following supplementary materials would support ESL instruction: quality high-interest, lower reading level, 
age 
appropriate books, flash cards, graphic organizers, picture dictionaries, translation software/language programs and apps, and 
the use of the computer lab. 
 
c. In addition to mandated minutes, ELLs within the 4-6 year window receive small pull-out instruction and in-class 
conferencing with 
content team teachers and ESL providers. In addition to the supplements mentioned above ELLs within the 4 - 6 years window 
will 
use Duolingo to increase reading comprehension.  Diagnostic assessments are used to target specific modalities and skill gaps 
that students will focus on during class and homework assignments. 
 
d.Currently, we do not have any  Long Term ELLs, however, they would receive additional instruction during lunch period and 
after 
school programs with the assistance of both content and ESL providers. Special efforts would be made to assist long-term ELLs 
with 
comprehension strategies, based on Q-Tel derived strategies. 
 
e. ESL providers would continue to support the former  ELL students by scaffolding strategies and differentiation plans, while 
still 
offering their modifications for the NYS exams. 
 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
In order to provide access to academic content areas and accelerate English language development the ESL teacher and 
content t 
team teachers will use the following strategy with ELL-SWDs: Small group instruction, pull-out instruction, and use of a 
dictionary in their native languages. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
In order to meet the diverse needs of  ELL-SWDs flexibility in the schedule allows for teachers to meet in grade teams and 
content teams weekly.  The ESL coordinator and content team teachers meet to discuss unit of studies, lessons and 
modifications for ELL-SWDs. In addition to units of study, instruction is modified and delivered by the ESL teacher during pull-
out sessions

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Spring Creek Community School  ELLs receive State-mandated number of ESL services in the form of push in and pull out 
support during English Language Arts blocks and other content classes. Students are encouraged to work cooperatively on 
learning projects and are grouped heterogeneously by ability within their L1 cohort.  Pull-out teacher works with students 
during content classes provides additional support materials to students to assist with comprehension. During independent 
work blocks, ELLs work with the ESL provider to review learning goals and increase reading comprehension. Content is re-
taught when needed and supported through L1 support and translation. 
 
Intervention strategies will consist of content team teachers and ESL service providers to be available  after school to assist 
students with skill building activities and specific comprehension issues. 
 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Saturday Academy and an ESL afterschool program which enables students to work on various projects from content classes 
with the help of the ESL teacher and technological support.    
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

None 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are invited to participate in all after school activities. Since our ELL population is very minimal, our students are able to 
participate in all after school programs, pertaining to enrichment.  Invitations go out to all students in the form of permission 
slips. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
SCCS teachers strive to create lessons that address all learning modalities through the use of software technology, visual aids, 
audio and video materials, kinesthetic activities, and relevant field trips. ESL materials include newcomer text books and work 
books, bilingual libraries, dictionaries, and glossaries, language manipulatives, instructional games, graphic novels, translation 
programs/software/apps, Rosetta Stone, and flash cards. 
 
 Staff members attend DOE and OELL-sponsored professional development seminars to remain up to date on the latest 
strategies and most effective techniques for delivering differentiated, project-based instruction. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language is supported in each content area by the existence of bilingual libraries and translation software/language 
learning apps accessible to students in each classroom.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Required services and support correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels. Students are provided age appropriate books and 
study materials.  Small group conferring is used to address individual student needs.     
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
SCCS teachers strive to create lessons that address all learning modalities through the use of software technology, visual aids, 
audio and video materials, kinesthetic activities, and relevant field trips. ESL materials include newcomer text books and work

strategies and most effective techniques for delivering differentiated, project-based instruction. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Since we currently do not have any new enrolled ELL students,  newly-arrived ELLs would be assisted by the SCCS staff before 
the beginning of the school year. Students and families will be connected to community-based support organizations, local and 
State assistance programs,as well as advocacy organizations, based on their needs. The ESl coordinator would maintain an 
active relationship with local groups to ensure that newly-arrived students and families will receive a minimum level of support 
during the newcomer process. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs:

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Non-attendance days for students will be labeled professional development days for all teachers of ELLs.  Professional 
development will be ongoing during the school year specifically on a designated Wednesday of each month.  Where possible, 
teachers will attend outside meetings for training and information.  
In addition to professional development, staff will be supported through online resources, co-planning and collaboration with 
content area teachers, and teacher team/inquiry meetings through common planning and unit projects. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all

Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided

If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
