Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Public School 54 is Public School 54 is committed to nurturing the intellectual, physical, social and emotional 
development of all our students and adults in our school. 

 

Vision 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

The vision of P.S. 54 is to bring our students into the 21st century through innovation and modern technology. We will 
have a quality, creative, compassionate, caring, and innovative teacher in every classroom for all students. We know 
that learning is the path to success; therefore, we will provide all of our students, no matter their differences and life 
circumstances, with the appropriate opportunities so that they may reach their true potential. Through project-based 
learning, differentiated teaching and a technology-infused curriculum, our students will become creative and critical 
thinkers with successful problem solving skills. This, in turn, will empower our students to leave their mark on society, 
succeed throughout their lives, and become human beings who would value, love, and respect themselves as well as 
others. 

Mission 

At Public School 54, our mission is to ensure that all children reach their true intellectual and human potential by 
developing the critical thinking skills, understandings, perseverance, and emotional strength needed to succeed in 
school, career, and life. Our teachers set high and obtainable goals for every child and provide multiple learning 
experiences infused with multiculturalism, technology, character development and conflict resolution to advance our 
students knowledge and learning to the highest level and extend their opportunities to succeed in society. 

We seek to foster in our students a sense of self-reliance; give them the freedom to explore and challenge 
themselves; and provide them with the tools they will need to create, discover, and evolve in this ever-changing 
world. We seek to unlock their limitless capabilities so that they may become lifelong learners. 

Minds, hearts, and hands work in harmony to inject life into our curriculum and through the use of technology engage 
our students in a 21 st Century learning environment where research, evaluation, and communication will expand 
their horizons from classroom life to the community they live in and across the globe. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Public School 54 offers a Dual Language Program (DL) (grades K-4) and English as a New Language (ENL) program as 
integrated or standalone for our English Language Learners (ELLs). These programs/services meet the needs of our 
ELLs in that they both build on their knowledge and proficiency in their native language as well as develop their 
proficiency in the new language (English). We believe that it is important for these students to not only learn the 
English language but also develop their native language proficiency. 

Public School 54 offers Special Education Teacher Support Services (SETSS and Self-Contained (SC) programs for our 
Students With Disabilities (SWDs). We believe in the least restrictive environment for students and this philosophy is 
reflected by our SETSS services as push-in or pull out to cover the needs of all of our kids with IEPs. However, we also 
understand that a smaller setting is sometimes needed for some of our learners who show more progress and 
achievement within a self-contained setting. Close attention is paid to placing students in the best setting for their 
individual needs. 

In order for all students to make gains in English Language Arts and Mathematics, our focus for this school year (2018-
2019) is small group guided instruction specifically in reading and writing. We believe that small group differentiated 
instruction is the most effective way to meet the various needs of all of our learners and to provide multiple entry 
points to grade level material. In order to help our teachers master the art of small group instruction Public School 54 
has several partnerships that assist us in achieving effective small group instruction in every classroom. These 
partnerships include Teachers' College Reading and Writing Program, Ballet-Tech, Digital Age Learning, Reading 
Rescue, Community Word Project, Fan4Kids, Little Orchestra, Cook Shop, and Dreamyard. Each of these partnerships 
have enabled us to expose our students to a wide range of opportunities that would hopefully help them reach their 
full potential.  

At Public School 54, we want our students to have the opportunity to realize and reach their full potentials and not be 
limited by their social status or the communities they live in, their nationality, ethnic background, language, their 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

academic/emotional needs, or by the status of his/her parents. Our school is inclusive and provides all of our students 
with the opportunities that would allow them to become competitive, resourceful, and successful human beings. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Public School 54X is a Title 1 school situated in the Fordham-Bedford section of the Bronx. This school serves 
free/reduced lunch to 96% of its population. The demographics of P.S. 54 is as follows: 72 % Latinos; 24% Black; 2% 
Asian; 1% White. This school educates students who come from all walks of life. We educate English Language 
Learners (ELLs) (33%) and Students With Disabilities (SWDs) (21%). However, our greatest challenge comes from 
students in temporary homes either in the form of shelter, temporary housing/shelters or double ups which 
approximates to almost ¼ of our population. All of our students, regardless of their needs, have a great deal of talent 
that we would like to explore and use as a vehicle to narrow and eventually close the opportunity gap that is leaving 
them behind. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The area where we showed the most progress within the Framework for Great Schools during the 2017-2018 
academic year was Strong Family-Community Ties. 

For this school year (2018-2019) our key area of focus is: student achievement/engagement through rigorous 
instruction . To do this, we will focus on rigorous instruction at all grade levels using the Teachers College Reading and 
and writing curriculum and aligning it to the Common Core Standards. The instruction will be customized to help us 
differentiate the learning needs of all of our students (e.g. SWDs, ELLs, lowest 1/3, regular ed). Instruction will be

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
 

Strength as per the 2016-2017 Quality Review (QR) : School Culture: The school has established a culture for learning 
that communicates high expectations to staff, students and families, and provide supports to achieve those 
expectations 

Priority Need as per 2016-2017 QR: To ensure that teachers develop units and lesson plans that are data-driven, 
differentiated, with multiple entry points and that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS standards.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June of 2019 all teaching staff will plan and implement rigorous and coherent curricula that is aligned to the CCLS to 
engage and meet the needs of our bottom 1/3. This will result in a 3% increase in the average proficiency level of the 
bottom 1/3 in the Spring 2019 NYS ELA Assessment.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
 

Strength: The school leader continues to implement C9W/ PBIS to reward student positive academic and personal 
behaviors. Students are informed of the definition and attributes of the specific traits for expected behaviors. 
Matrices of expected behaviors are in evidence in classrooms and across school corridors. There has been an 
impressive shift in the school's culture and student social emotional growth. The school leader continues to embrace 
a collaboration with Columbia University, thus permitting Social worker interns to provide students and families with 
services. The school leader ensures the school's Counseling Center, serves as a "safe place" for students to discuss 
concerns with interns. Incident rates at the school have decreased dramatically; however, the school's attendance has 
yet to show a substantial increase. 

Priority Need: According to our YTD, our school needs to increase our attendance rate and decrease our chronic 
absenteeism. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June of 2019 chronic absenteeism will decrease by 3%. Monthly attendance will be monitored by RAMO and the 
end of the year attendance rate will be measure by the YTD.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strength as per 2017 QR:  

School leaders and staff effectively communicate expectations connected to a path to college and career readiness 
and successfully partner with families to support student progress toward those expectations  

The principal has established amazing bonds with families and students, thus strengthening the school community 
ties. The school leader has clearly conveyed the message to all constituents of the school and community that the 
mission is to elevate student achievement, progress and ensure students’ social  

and emotional well-being. The principal expressed that her communication with families and parents goes beyond the 
mandated Tuesday parent engagement. On Tuesday's, the school is dedicated to ensuring that families, parents and 
students review work and student data. Students share work folders with parents at scheduled 

times on Tuesday afternoons. The principal also goes beyond providing professional learning cycles to teachers and 
ensures teacher team is a collaborative effort with the school's administrative team engaged in the process. PBIS 
expectations and celebrations serve to convey the expected behaviors for students. As a result of 

the systems and processes, and the Principal's ongoing visibility throughout the neighborhood and community events, 
all constituents of the school community clearly understand the Principal's high expectations. 

 

Priority Needs as per the 2017-2018 Environment Survey: As per the NYC Environment Survey, we need to continue 
encouraging parents to become more involved with the school community when it comes to volunteering at school.  
 
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  

By June 2019 the school will see an increase in parental involvement through volunteering opportunities offered 
at the school. This will be measured by by a 5% increase in the Parent Involvement section of the the New York 
City Environment Survey.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
In order to recruit high quality teachers, we do the following: 

● Work closely with our district HR point person, traditional teacher education programs, and alternative 
licensure programs. 
• Attend hiring fairs to identify and recruit highly-qualified teachers. 
• Work closely with our HR point person to ensure that all required documentation and assessment deadlines 
are met. 
• Begin recruiting when the teachers complete and return their preference sheets. 
• Look in the NYCDOE Finder online system. 
• Reach out to nearby universities chair person in the ELL/SWDs education departments. 
• Ask staff to recommend professionals for interviews. 

Have established a screening team comprised of staff members that are experts in the vacancy area. 

• The staff conducts level 1 screening measuring content knowledge. If candidates pass level 1 screening, the 
person is invited to return for a demonstration with children that represent the vacancy area. If the vacancy is 
declared during the summer, we use our summer school students as a lab site for demonstrations. 
• During the school year, the payroll secretary reaches out to teachers to ensure she has all of their updates 
information. If a teacher is highlighted as not highly qualified by BEDS the secretary tries to resolve the issue 
with the teacher. If that does not work, the principal meets with the teacher to create a timeline to resolve the 
issue. The UFT Chapter person also is privy of the information, provided by the UFT and they also consult with 
teachers. 
• We have established a highly qualified committee that discusses professional development and mentoring for 
new teachers. 
• Mentors work 1:1 with new teachers, confer, and push in their classrooms to model and provide coaching. 
• We provide all our teachers with professional development aligned to NYCDOE’s citywide expectations and 
Danielson’s Framework to assist them in getting their 100 hours as required by NYSED for teachers who hold 
professional certificates.. 
• Assignments are given by teachers’ goals, preference, administrators’ observations and students’ 
performance. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

In our efforts to retain highly qualified teachers and ensure that they have the supports and 

strategies to grow professionally, we are highly invested in professional development. We offer professional 
development to teachers on current topics provided by other teachers, administrators, and consultants and 
based on the NYCDOE Handbook For Professional Learning: Research, Resources, and Strategies for 
Implementation. 

  Mentoring is implemented as per teacher requirements. We are members of the Teacher Development 

Coach. 

  We believe in individualized professional development plans that are designed to focus on each teacher’s 
needs. Teachers are active participants in the process and collaborate with administration to look at their 
development/progress, mainly through the observation/feedback process which utilizes the Danielson’s 
Framework for Teaching as well as through student practice. 

  Teachers self-assess on a regular basis and confer with school leaders. 
  All professional development is research-based and evidence-based. Research-based strategies are 

 

emphasized in our trainings. 
Labsites and Inter-visitations are encouraged for all teachers as well as participation in external professional 
development opportunities. 

  We are committed to ensuring that teachers have the resources and support needed to increase student 

success. Additionally, we have allocated a Teacher Resource/Professional Learning Center so that teachers 
have a quiet space to work and share. We encourage celebrations of success and sharing. 

  Professional Development created based on students’ needs and teachers’ performance as evidenced by our 

observation/feedback cycles and students’ work and assessments. 

  Classroom observations are paired with feedback to help teachers and their evaluators exchange ideas about 
the teacher’s practice and help teachers improve. As evaluators and teachers look at the four domains of the 
Danielson Framework for Teaching more frequently, they become more skilled at using observation data to 
support teacher growth and student achievement.. 

  Weekly Danielson Framework workshops are provided based on Domains 2 and 3. Other domains have also 

 

been covered in these workshops. All staff attends these weekly workshops (paraprofessionals, content 
specialist, related service providers, classroom teachers, APs). 
Feedback conversations provide teachers and evaluators the opportunity to reflect on areas of both strength 
and development from the shared observation and determine next steps to improve practice and student 
outcomes. Feedback occurs after every observation. 

  PD is being supported via TCWRP, Literacy and Math workshops provided by our network, workshops for ELLs 

and SWDs, and the Office for English Language Learners. 

  Principal and assistant principals attend professional development sessions offered by the OELL, the 
Danielson Group, Teacher Effectiveness Program, School Leadership Development and our District. 

 

 

Teachers will be involved in individual conferences/differentiated PD, and setting goals with their supervisor - each 
teaching staff member will review expectations (ADVANCE, MOSL, Danielson’s Framework) and create goals that are 
aligned to our overall school goals and collaborate with supervisors during 1:1 conferences to create collaborative 
action plan with timeline.

4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)  

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
At P.S. 54 we hold orientation meetings for families of preschool students to inform parents and assist them in the 
successful transition of their child from preschool into elementary school. At these meetings we work with parents to 
ensure that their child’s transition from preschool into elementary school is seamless. To ensure a successful 
transition we do the following: 

● Provide parents with the elementary school directory which explains what parents need to know and do 
if their child is starting Kindergarten the following year (in this case in September of 2018). 
● Flyers/leaflets are distributed with information pertaining to registration and procedures for registering 
future Kindergarten students. Parents are advised to visit the DOE websites for more in-depth information 
about how to get started, programs. and services and other important information pertaining to students 
with special needs or to determine if a child is a child with special needs or needs to be provided with other 
related services upon their entering elementary school. 
● Information is provided to parents via newsletters, emails, the school website, PA meetings, and other 
notifications as to how they can best meet the needs of their child (i.e. special education, ELLs, specialized 
schools for G&T, etc.). 
● Information is provided to parents about the school and how to best understand the performance of the 
school (e.g. Parent Handbook, Website, Emails). 
● Information is provided to parents about the school curriculum, early intervention and services and 
supports available for their child and the family. 
● Information is provided to parents about the school in general (i.e. schedules, operations, events, etc.). 
● The school manual is provided to parents to further inform them about parent involvement and the 
school in general. 
● Our curriculum is aligned to the CCSS and lessons are differentiated as per the needs of the students. 
● Our pedagogues are trained in early learning and receive differentiated PD for working with kindergarten 
students. 
● Our pedagogues participate in PD targeting specific foundations for teaching and learning in the early 
grades. 
● Our pedagogues are trained in analyzing data to target, understand and provide support for our newly 
admit kindergarten students. 

Our school culture supports family engagement and encourages parents to be active participants in their child’s 
education through regular meetings, workshops on the CCSS, activities such as family and curriculum nights, 
assemblies, celebrations and participation in the SLT and in our Parent Association monthly meetings. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 
 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
In our efforts t o ensure that our teachers are involved in shared decision making and participate in the selection of 
appropriate assessments that serve to measure and assess improve d instruction and increase academic success , we 
do the following: 

We offer individualized professional development to teachers on current topics such as best practice and base d on 
the teacher’ s self-reflection . These professional development opportunities are aligned to the Danielson Framework 
for Teaching and advance 

Teacher s are active participant s in the decision-making process and collaborate with administration to look at 
student work regularly, review progress or lack o f progress and decide on what assessments or interventions will be 
utilized t o improve instruction and academic achievement. The result s o f these assessments are discussed during 
the grade meetings and closely monitored by all teachers. 

We are committed to ensuring that teacher s have the resource s and the support needed to increase student 
success; therefore, teachers are encouraged to attend professional development at the district level, UFT, DELLSS and 
as provided by other teachers who turn key and are used as teacher leaders within the content they teach. This, we 
hope, will increase our teachers’ knowledge of how students learn best and support us in selecting assessments that 
will help us identify the differentiated needs of our students. 

 

 Teachers meet in teams on a weekly basis to discuss student work and to analyze trends. Based on these meetings, 
teachers adjust their lessons, make suggestions as to what they think will work best and the assessments that will 
help us to identify what works best for the population we serve and for the individual needs of each student (ELLs, 
SWDs, G&T, etc.). 

 

 Danielson Framework workshops are provided based on the components teachers will be rated on. Other 
domains/components are also covered in these workshops. All staff attends these workshops (paraprofessionals, 
content specialist, related service providers, classroom teachers, APs). These workshops are resourceful in helping us 
all understand competency 3d (using assessment in instruction) and what assessments will help us to monitor our 
students’ progress or lack of it. Teachers always make recommendations as to what they think they and their students 
need in order to succeed. Recommendations are always acknowledged and taken under consideration. 

 As members of the school team, teachers use and create assessments, rubrics, and grading policies that are aligned 
with the school’s curricula and offer a clear portrait of student mastery, thus providing actionable and meaningful 
feedback to students, teachers and teachers regarding student achievement. 

 As a team, we use common assessments to create a clear picture of student progress toward goals across grades 
and subjects, track progress, and adjust curricular and instructional decisions so that all students (ELLs, SWDs and 
G&T) continue to demonstrate increased mastery and academic success. 

 As a team and across the classrooms, the assessments we choose reflect the varied use of ongoing checks for 
understanding so that teachers make effective adjustments to meet the needs of all our learners and work and design 
next steps. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 

 As a team, teachers and administrators implement assessments and analyze results and evaluate the effectiveness 
of the assessments used or the PD provided to teachers. 

 Use student data and observations to assess teacher effectiveness and diagnose needs of both teachers and 
students. 

 As a team, we work on developing a shared understanding of instructional excellence. 

 Administrators hold regular meetings and maintain open communication with teachers about results and develop 
strategies for targeted improvement. 

 As a team, we use multiple sources of evidence that helps us set our expectations for: instructional planning, 
classroom delivery and student assessment and evaluate our commitment to improving our instructional practice. 

 Assessments are selected based on feedback from teachers and the results are analyzed carefully during our weekly 
data meetings. Analyzing the results of each assessment helps us in determining what to dispose of and what we need 
to continue using to further improve instruction and advance academic achievement. 

 All of our teachers are engaged in inquiry-based, structured professional collaborations that have strengthened our 
instructional capacity and have helped us in promoting the implementation of the CCLS and the instructional shifts in 
ELA and Mat. This, we are hoping, will result in a school-wide instructional coherence and increased student 
achievement for all of our learners (ELLs, SWDs, and G&T). 

 Teacher teams and administrators systematically analyze key elements of teacher practice through the analysis of 
students work, including classroom practice, assessment data, and student work. This, we hope, will result in shared 
improvements in teacher practice and mastery of goals for groups of students in ELA and Math. 

 Our leadership is distributed so that there is effective teacher leadership. Teachers play an integral role in key 
decisions that affect student learning across the school. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. / I.S. 54, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Public School 54X will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement 
level, e.g., literacy, math and use of technology; 
● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning 
and decision making in support of the education of their children;

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school. 

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

 

 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the 
implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 
● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are 
allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting 
skills; 
● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 
strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, 
the Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes 
providing technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership 
skills;  
● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  
● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 
● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise 
parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their 
right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 
1118 and other applicable sections under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act; 
● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of 
the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  
● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations 
and workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

This program will begin in October of 2018  
The purpose of this After School Program is to: 
1. Increase English proficiency and academic achievement in core academic subjects of our 
ELLs by providing high-quality language instruction during after school programs. 
2. The after school Title III supplemental programs for ELLs will target students (ELLs and 
SWDs) at the entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding, and commanding levels of English 
language acquisition, as per their spring 2018NYSESLAT scores, in grades 1-5 and for K based 
on the latest assessment (NYSITEL.  At least 100 students will be invited to this program. 
 
3. This program is scheduled to begin October 31, 2018 and will be  taught for  15  weeks at 4 
hours per week/per teacher on Wednesday, Thursdays from 2:30 - 4:30 pm. It's approximate 
ending time will be the last week of January 2019. 
4. The language of instruction will be English. 
5. This program will be taught by 5 certified bilingual and ENL teachers. 
6. Our focus will be Reading/Writing and Listening/Speaking. We will use the NYSESLAT and 
Beyond Instructional materials and the Award Reading Program  for our supplemental after 
school program for ELLs. This program will help students and teachers stay focused and true to 
the students' academic and language needs as well as the details of the new common core 
standards and the ENL standards. The teacher-led lessons use a consistent, research-based, 
gradual-release model that helps students master language acquisition and concepts as they build 
confidence. Within this program there is also embedded professional development in every 
Teacher Resource Book including step-by-step lesson plans and best-practice tips for ELLs and 
SWDs. 
The  classes will have access to the latest technology (e.g. smart boards, laptops, elmos, iPads, 
teleconference system, Promethean, etc.) and to a wide range of non-fiction books at different 
levels. Other related literature will also be available for independent and guided practice (leveled 
libraries).  
Using NYSESLAT and Beyond and our leveled library, students will be able do the following 
with the support of their teachers: 
Read broadly from the wide reading library of leveled books 

     Read deeply from the science or social studies investigation libraries 
     Expand their vocabulary and background knowledge of different genres and activate prior  

knowledge through the use of higher order thinking questions (Depth of Knowledge). 
The teachers also do reading intervention. This includes: 

     Explicit, differentiated instruction 
      vocabulary development/Academic language development 
     Guided reading practice to build academic language and content knowledge

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
To improve their students' writing skills, the teachers will do the following: 
Writing: 
To differentiate our students’ writing needs and to enhance their writing skills: 
Modeled writing (informational, narrative, etc) to give students the opportunity to be involved in 
the writing process at their level as they grasp the new learning. It also gives them the 
opportunity to articulate their learning and make sense of the writing process. The teacher also 
models how to write in the different content areas within the writing workshop model. 
Shared writing is based on assessments and students’ needs where the teacher and the 
students  discuss, give opinions, and construct the text together. During the shared writing 
discussion is encouraged and practiced between the students with other students and the teacher 
as the text is being written and as the teacher is explaining the process of writing. Shared writing 
allows students to practice their new writing skills during their independent writing.  
Guided writing is based on the students’ needs. Here the students are  grouped according to their 
writing needs in small groups where the teacher will explain the purpose for the writing and 
model what s/he wants his/her students to learn. Students will be given the opportunity to discuss 
and practice the new learning.  
By the end of the program we are expecting our participating students to become commanding in 
Reading/Writing and Listening/Speaking in the NYSESLAT and to improve academically and 
reach grade-level standards.

and of quality, the personnel of this school values ELLs, understands their linguistic, academic, 
cultural and life needs and prioritizes the social-emotional needs of these students. We ground 
our practice and teaching in research-based best practices that help us to enrich the lives of these 
students and their families. We are always seeking ways to fully integrate the experiences of 
these students into the curriculum as we differentiate their instruction as per their 
NYSESLAT/NYSITEL, Spanish Lab scores, formative and summative assessments and students' 
IEPs.  
3. To strengthen and improve the instruction our ELL students receive and to make sure that the 
lessons the teachers are providing are differentiated, engaging and relevant, the principal, Dr.

and 1 hour per workshop from 2:30 - 3:30 for the duration of the program (15 weeks) beginning 
the third week (around October 17, 2018) of the program: 
3. Our first workshop is scheduled for October 18,and is titled: "At Home Strategies and 
Working With Your Child’s School" provided by Dr. Ferreira with the assistance of our school 
social worker, Ms. Ilarraza. During this workshop we will share with parents best practice and 
strategies to use at home to help their child acquire the academic language they need to succeed 
in school: Listening to your child read regardless of the language the child is reading in; websites 
to visit like colorin/colorado for resources.  
Three other workshops (one will be on the the fourth week, another on the sixth week and 
another one on the seventh week). These workshops will target our new independent reading 
system "100 Book Challenge." These workshop will focus on specific reading skills each time it 
is offered. We will look at strength, weaknesses in reading/writing and listening/speaking. These 
workshop will be provided by Ms. Mooney, our literacy coach with the assistance of our 
bilingual parent coordinator. During these workshops parents will be taught strategies to use at 
home to help their child read and develop academic language. These workshops will reinforce 
reading independently while using books that are at their level in English. Parents will also be 
taught how to use skill/vocabulary cards to help their child develop understanding of the 
English  Language and expand their English vocabulary.  
4. For the purpose of this program, Dr. Ferreira, Ms. Costar, ELLs coordinator, Ms. Aleman, 
parent coordinator, Ms. Mooney, literacy coach, will be available to assist and work with the 
parents of  ELL students during the after school supplemental program (at no cost to title III). 
We will provide the following activities and topics to be covered during the after school program 
(ninth week, eleventh week and thirteenth week) and as needed and based on needs assessments. 
These topics will be covered by our mental health team which is composed of social workers, 
counselors and school psychologists: 
1.     Activities for  Parents and children: Helping our kids acquire critical thinking 
-     How to create a long lasting bond with your child as you learn together 
-     At home activities (e.g. projects, family literacy, writing letters, writing journals) 
2.     Self Esteem, Behavioral , and Mental Health Issues in Children: 
-At Home Strategies 
- Working with your child’s school  
-Mental Health resources in the community 
3.     Helping your child excel in school: 
-     Study plans and guides  
-     Good at home study habits 
-     Reading with your child 
-     Helpful study websites/ Library Resources 
4.     Behavior issues at home and school 
-     Behavior contracts  
-     PBIS home matrix 
5.     Navigating the school system and how to get needed services 
-     Who to talk to if you feel your child has a delay or disability 
-     At-Risk Services 
-     Special Education Services  
- The last workshops (the fourteenth and fifteenth week) will be used to look at and interpret 
student data based on the latest assessments done during the program. The assessment will cover 
the following components of the NYSESLAT: reading/writing and listening/speaking. We will 
work on helping parents and teaching parents how to support their child at home and how to 
engage their child in activities where these components are utilized (e.g. questions/discussions).

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
5. To facilitate and ensure academic excellence for all ELLs, parents of ELLs are informed 
through monthly calendars, emails, newsletters, the school website, meetings, and workshops as 
to new developments concerning our English Language Learners and workshops/learning 
opportunities available at the school. Every effort is made to communicate and assist parents 
throughout the school year and to do this we have the following personnel providing services to 
our ELLs, SWDs and regular students and their families: Bilingual school counselors and Social 
Workers, Psychologists, Bilingual SETSS, a bilingual principal, a bilingual parent coordinator 
who holds weekly workshops for parents and with parents. The School Leadership Team and 
Parent Association are also very involved in the life of the school and our school community in 
general. They hold monthly meetings. During these meetings parents are informed and updated 
about school/community related issues and updates on mandates.  
Moreover, to better serve the parents of ELLs, we have translated our school FAQ, PBIS Matrix, 
into French and Spanish and the monthly school calendar that goes out to parents and the 
community is also in English and Spanish. All of the information provided to our parents is 
usually in multiple languages and translation is provided as needed as per the chancellor's 
regulation A-663. 
Through our open communication with the community we serve, we evaluate the needs of our 
parents and offer them the services and resources they need to ensure parental participation and 
involvement in their child's educational social-emotional and academic life.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
At P.S. 54 we use various assessments to determine our English Language Learners' language and academic needs. We use the 
DRA-2 to measure English literacy in grades  K-5 and EDL (DRA) in Spanish with newcomers and students in the Dual Language 
program in grades k-4.    We also use running records to assess reading progress and Fountas and Pinnell in grades K-5 with the 
ELL students to measure growth in phonemic awareness and decoding skills in English. For Spanish speakers, phonemic 
awareness and decoding abilities are also assessed using Estrellita. We also use rubrics in Spanish/English to determine our 
ELLs' writing needs . We also administer a baseline/midline/endline writing assessment in Spanish/English. The data obtained 
from the different assessments (e.g. DRA-2, EDL, teacher-created assessments in reading/writing, running records, etc.) 
indicates that our ELLs need differentiated and targeted instruction in reading/writing and developing the academic language 
needed to reach grade level standard. The data also tells us that our students need differentiated listening comprehension and 
vocabulary acquisition. Teachers of ELLs use this information (DRA-2, EDL levels, estrellita, writing assessments) to plan for 
small group instruction (e.g. listening/speaking/reading/writing) and include multiple entry points in all of their lessons within 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

the content areas (e.g. science, SS, math, literacy, etc).  
  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

We have an ENL teacher supporting our effort in ensuring that our ELLs reach grade level standard as well as an F-status who 
provides AIS for all ELLs at our school at all different levels. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The results of the NYSESLAT test is used by the ENL/DL teachers to identify student's strength and weaknesses.  Based on 
results of NYSITELL, NYSESLAT test, interim assessments, student conferences, teacher observation and collaboration, SMART 
goals are established for each student according to their needs.  
Multiple measures of student progress in literacy and content areas are used to evaluate the programs' success.  These include 
formative literacy measures, summative end of unit content area assessments, state exams (e.g. ELA, Math, Science)and the 
NYSESLAT.  Other measures may also be used.  Taken together they form a profile of how successful the programs are and 
how much progress our students are making. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

We have an RTI/AIS teacher who provides academic intervention as well as an F-status teacher who works with ELLs to 
strengthen their reading, writing, listening and speaking skills in English. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Students are identified for RTI/AIS services using multiple forms of classroom data, and in consultation with a committee (SIT) 
of specialists who  hear and analyze cases for RTI/AIS and make recommendations based on this data.  Once students have 
been identified for RTI/AIS, the teacher creates a plan which responds to the needs indicated by the data and create a system 
to track the domains in which the teacher will try to make impact to improve the area(s) in which the student needs help, 
according to that data.  Data collection is done in cycles, (i.e. 6-8 weeks in duration) and assessments at the end of the fixed 
period informs the teacher about whether or not to continue an intervention or to move on to a next step.   
  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The NYSITELL assesses the English language level of new students whose home or primary language is other than English. The 
score of the  NYSITELL (Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding, or Commanding) determines if the student is entitled to 
receive ELL services and will determine the level of English language support for the student. The results help teachers plan the 
best program for their students based on the student's  strengths and needs in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in 
English. The NYSITELL and the NYSESLAT assess reading, writing, listening and speaking and our data shows that when a child 
scores at the Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding, or Commanding level the scores are consistent on both 
assessments.   
  
 The data obtained from the NYSITELL helps us create programs that would help us address the language needs of our new 
students (e.g. Dual Language or ENL either in an integrated classroom or stand-alone program).  
  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The finding is shared with all of the teachers who worked with ELLs and during PD days we share, analyze and review data to 
ensure that the needs of our ELLs are met in a timely and effective fashion.

Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

In order to meet the high standards set for all students at P.S. 54 and to ensure that our ELLs participate equally in 
literacy,  mathematics and other content areas, we provide each of our ELLs with coherent programs that are 
delivered throughout the school  day.  
Our instruction is rigorous and it targets academic language, cognitive development and academic and life skills. With 
this in mind,  we provide our ELLs with the following models:  stand alone/integrated  model, and a DL model in 
Kindergarten, Grade 1, Grade 2, grade 3 and grade 4.  
We follow the recommendations set forth in part 154 and provide the units of study as mandated by this regulation.  
Our dual language program includes the following:  
•an ENL component designed to develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in English  
•all content-area courses/subjects are taught in the home language and English  
•a home language arts component designed to develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in the 
students’ home 
language while cultivating an appreciation of their history and culture  
•50% of the students are ELLs of the same home language; 50% of the students are not ELLs (former ELLs or never 
ELLs)  
  
In our stand alone/integrated model the ENL teacher comes into the classroom to serve students for the mandated 
time as 
determined by their  New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test scores (NYSESLAT) (90 minutes, 
180 minutes,  
360 minutes) during content area instruction/other units of study. The ENL teacher and the classroom teacher work 
together to plan 
and to make sure those students are receiving support as they receive content area instruction (e.g. Social Studies, 
ELA, Science, 
 Math, Arts). In this model both teachers work in collaboration to provide language acquisition and vocabulary 
support while  
retaining content instruction time.  
  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

NA   

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

In Dual Language, students are placed in a "one-world" program in which the classroom teacher provides instruction 
in each of the 
 languages (English and Spanish).  
Our dual language program includes the following:  
•an ENL component designed to develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in English  
•all content-area courses/subjects are taught in the home language (Spanish) and English  
•a home language arts component designed to develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in the 
students’ home 
 language while cultivating an appreciation of their history and culture  
•50% of the students are ELLs of the same home language; 50% of the students are not ELLs (former ELLs or never 
ELLs)

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   At P.S. 54 we use programs that serve as resources that enhance our students’ English language development and listening 
comprehension.  Our instruction is differentiated and targets different areas of language acquisition as well as the listening 
skills that students must develop in order to enhance their listening comprehension through the use of a robust emphasis on 
phonemic awareness and vocabulary formation. 
        Teachers of ELLs do read a louds to further enhance their students’ listening skills by listening to them explain, make 
connections and discuss their thinking and ideas. During the read aloud teachers assess comprehension by asking higher order 
and critical thinking questions about the reading and by asking students to summarize their understanding of the 
story/passage they had just listened to in their own words. 
        Our ELL students participate in our 30 minutes of daily intervention support by the classroom and a push in teacher. 
During this time, these students are highly engaged in independent reading (native language or new language (English), 
conferencing one-on-one with the teacher and participating in targeted-small group instruction. 
  
        Listening: it is planned throughout the content areas (S.S., Science, Math, Arts, NL, ESL) and follows the NYS common core 
standards, the NYS ESL learning standards and the NYS NL arts learning standards. 
        Speaking: It is planned in all content areas and follows NYS common core standards, NYS NL arts standards, and NYS ESL 
learning standards.  
        During content area instruction, in both the ENL, DL Programs, teachers plan strategically and use different techniques 
that include involving students in discussion, interactive talk, thinking-pairing-sharing (TPS) to enagage all students in 
accountable talk, where all students are involved in class discussion and in discussions with their classmates. Students are also 
using the 100 Book Challenge independent reading program during the assigned independent reading time in both their native 
language (Spanish) and in English. During the students’ independent reading time, teachers confer with students and give 
them opportunities to communicate their understanding verbally. This discussion between the teacher and the student allows 
the student to practice speaking for understanding.  
  
Through shared reading students have the opportunity to verbally share their opinions in the language of instruction, ideas 
and  
interpretations of the reading. Through shared reading the teachers also model fluency, vocabulary development,  
expressive speaking, and engage the students in discussions that are cooperative and strategic with a focus on the oral/spoken 
language.   
  
 Reading: It is planned in all content areas and follows NYS common core standards, NYS NL arts standards, and NYS ENL

        Libraries in English and in the native language are a main component in the DL classes and are differentiated according to 
levels, genre, interest and are coded to make sure that all students have access to books that they will feel comfortable 
reading and at the same time challenging and interesting.   
        Through guided reading (Spanish and English) children are grouped based on assessments of  their reading needs and the 
guided lessons are focused and include the strategies to be practiced based on the needs of the students. In addition, in grades 
PK-5 students are using the 100 Book challenge in English and in Spanish during the independent/intervention reading block to 
improve reading comprehension and to engage students in meaningful, engaging and relevant reading. Through shared 
reading the teacher also models vocabulary development and engages his/her students in discussions that target reading 
comprehension. 
  
Interactive read aloud allows students and teachers to be engaged in making connections and enhancing reading  
comprehension through meaningful discussions of the reading and the focus and purpose for the reading in Ensglish and in 
Spanish.  
  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

  
ESTRELLITA: 
We use ESTRELLITA in grades K-2 in dual language classes with students who are not reading in their native language (Spanish). 
Estrellita serves as a bridge to English, by laying a strong foundation in Spanish literacy that later leads to a more successful 
transition to 
 English. Estrellita is especially effective for small group instruction which will help to get students back on track in Spanish 
literacy and 
 their transition to English.  Estrellita utilizes a proven, systematic, accelerated approach to teaching syllables  and meets  the 
needs of 
 ELLs  no matter the performance level.  It also jump start into reading for recent arrivals with no formal schooling. 
•     Accelerated, beginning Spanish Reading 
•     Supplemental to our core bilingual education program 
•     Multisensory instruction in phonemic awareness, phonics, and fluency 
•     Sequential, cumulative, structured, systematic, and differentiated direct instruction 
•     Continuous diagnostic assessment that informs instruction 
  
Performance tasks in Spanish and in English in reading/writing/math are utilized throughout the year and after each unit of 
study to make sure that our ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home language. Rubrics in spanish/english are used as a 
form of assessment and to ensure that students are undrtsanding the tasks in both languages. We will also use the ELE in all of 
the dual Language classes to assess spanish acquisition. The results of these assessments will help to further differentiate 
planning for Spanish instruction in our dual language classes ranging from grades K-3.  
  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

SIFE students  are being provided with, in addition to their regular ENL program, AIS during the day designed for SIFE. They 
also receive support in literacy, through Shared Reading/guided reading in the home language (Spanish) and in English. 
Our ELL students also participate in our 30 minutes of daily intervention support by the classroom and a push-in teacher. 
During this time, these students are highly engaged in independent reading, conferencing one-on-one with the teacher and 
participating in targeted-small group instruction.

Listening: it is planned throughout the content areas (S.S., Science, Math, Arts, NL, ENL) and follows the NYS common core 
standards,  the NYS ENL learning standards and the NYS NL arts learning standards. 
  
At P.S. 54 we will be using programs that serve as resources to enhance our students’ English language development and 
listening comprehension such as the Award Reading program. This is a program that targets the five major domains of reading 
through the use of technology and print which accelerates reading ability. One of the main components of this program 
involves listening comprehension and developing good listening skills. 
Teachers of ELLs also do read aloud to further enhance their students’ listening skills by listening to them explain, make 
connections and discuss their thinking and ideas. During the read aloud teachers assess comprehension by asking higher order 
and critical thinking questions about the reading and by asking students to summarize their understanding of the 
story/passage they had just listened to in their own words - these students are also engaged in discussions and discourse in 
English through the use of academic language. 
  
Speaking: It is planned in all content areas and follows NYS common core standards, NYS NL arts standards, and NYS ESL 
learning standards.  
During content area instruction, in both the ESL and the Dual Language Programs, teachers plan strategically and use 
different techniques that include involving students in discussions, interactive talk/team talk/group talk ), thinking-pairing-
sharing(TPS) to engage all students in accountable talk, where all students are involved in class discussion and in discussions 
with their classmates. During the students’ independent reading time, teachers confer with students and give them 
opportunities to communicate their understanding verbally. This discussion between the teacher and the student allows the 
student to practice speaking for understanding.

language.   
Reading: It is planned in all content areas and follows NYS common core standards, NYS NL arts standards, and NYS ESL 
learning standards.  
  
Libraries in English and in the native language are a main component in the Dual LAnguage classes and are differentiated 
 according to levels, genre, interest and are coded to make sure that all students have access to books that they will feel  
comfortable reading and at the same time challenging and interesting.   
Through guided reading children are grouped based on assessments of  their reading needs and the guided lessons are focused 
 and include the strategies to be practiced based on the needs of the students. Through shared reading the teacher also 
models 
 vocabulary development and engages his/her students in discussions that target reading comprehension. 
  
Interactive read aloud allows students and teachers to be engaged in making connections and enhancing reading  
comprehension through meaningful discussions of the reading and the focus and purpose for the reading.  
  
The texts used in our ESL and DL programs are thought-provoking. These texts connect to the world and experiences of 
young children and to the content of the curriculum. They guide children along a leveled continuum of reading success and 
ensure that they develop the necessary grade-level fluency, comprehension, and technology skills. 
Skills—There is comprehensive skills development, practice, and application in each teaching plan. Children develop reading 
skills in the five key areas recognized for success in learning to read: phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, fluency, and 
comprehension.  
  
ESTRELLITA: 
We use ESTRELLITA in grades K-2 in DL classes with students who are not reading in their native language (Spanish) and those 
who are learning a second language (Spanish in our DL classes). 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64

Writing: It is planned in all content areas and follows NYS common core standards, NYS NL arts standards, and NYS ESL learning 
standards.  
  
Teachers of ELLs do the following to differentiate our students’ writing needs and to enhance their writing skills: 
  
Modeled writing occurs in all content areas and in various genres to give students the opportunity to be involved in the writing 
process at their level as they grasp the new learning. It also gives them the opportunity to articulate their learning and make 
sense of the writing process. The teacher also models how to write in the different content areas within the writing workshop. 
  
Shared writing is also based on assessments and students’ needs where the teacher and the students discuss, give opinions, 
and construct the text together. During the shared reading discussion is encouraged and practiced between the students with 
other students and the teacher as the text is being written and as the teacher is explaining the process of writing. Shared 
writing allows students to practice their new writing skills during their independent writing.  
  
Guided writing is based on the students’ needs. Here the students are grouped according to their writing needs in small groups 
 where the teacher explains the purpose for the writing and models what s/he wants his/her students to learn. Students are 
given 
 the opportunity to discuss and practice the new learning. Students are also given the opportunity to articulate their learning 
as the 
 lesson is being explained.  
  
Math is taught in both the NL and the second language as per the proficiency of our students. Students also receive support 
through ESL strategies/methodologies:  
Our school is following NYS mathematics standards and Common Core Learning Standards to drive instruction (Teachers' 
College Reading and Writing Curriculum and Go Math).  
Social Studies: We follow the NYS Common Core Standards/NYC Scope and Sequence for social studies and 
differentiate instruction based on language needs. We also follow the  NYS NL arts standards, and NYS ESL learning standards 
to support our ELLs.  We also use the NYC K-8 Social Studies Scope and Sequence. 
Science: It is planned in all content areas and follows NYS common core standards, NYS NL arts standards, and NYS ESL learning 
standards.   
We also use the K-8 science scope and sequence and use NL as well as ESL methodologies to supoort our ELLS. 
LEP students held over in grade: 
To ensure that our ELLs are assessed and evaluated accordingly and in their native language we use formative and 
summative assessments such as Teacher-made assessments as per standards and content area, ELE, LAB-R, SP-Lab,  translators 
are used during assessment for students who speak other languages than English and Spanish (following mandated 
guidelines).  
  
Students who have been held over in a grade receive AS (Academic Support) from specialized personnel who 
differentiate instruction that targets the students’ specific needs as per formative, summative, periodic and standardized 
assessments.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

Also, students in grades K-5 who are repeating a grade participate in our intervention period where they are grouped and 
taught according to their needs. This intervention period is 30 minutes long and is provided 5 days a week. During this 
intervention period students receive one-to-one guided instruction through individual conference and small-targeted group 
instruction. These students also receive support from our Academic Support Team, Academic Intervention Team, Instructional 
Support Team and Student 
Intervention Team. These teams are composed of highly competent teachers, school social workers and guidance counselors. 
They also receive “at risk” intervention from our Special Education Teacher Support Services (SETSS) and other special 
education licensed teachers who provide academic support as needed.  In addition to this help, these students receive native 
language support as needed and ENL instruction as per their mandated time throughout the day.   
  
ELL students who have been designated at risk and are in a program designed to prevent a referral to a Committee on 
Special Education 
These students receive support from our Academic Support Team, Academic Intervention Team, Instructional Support Team 
and Student Intervention Team. These teams are composed of highly competent teachers, school social workers and guidance 
counselors. 
ELL students who have been referred to the Committee on Special Education for a multidisciplinary evaluation: 
Prior to making a referral, students are identified by their teachers and recommended to our IST  
(Instructional Support Team) and the SIT (Student Intervention Team) who provide interventions  
and make recommendations as they meet with the parents, the teachers and other intervention and  
related services personnel.  
  
ELL students with interrupted, little or no formal schooling in their first language. 
  
At P. S. 54 we are differentiating instruction for English Language Learners and SIFE. These programs are Intervention by 
Design By Rigby, Award Readin Program. Another program that we use is Estrellita which emphasis is on phonemic awareness 
in Spanish - it is multisensory instruction in phonemic awareness, phonics, and fluency. It is sequential, cumulative, structured, 
systematic, and differentiated direct instruction. It is a continuous diagnostic assessment that informs instruction To enhance 
the language acquisition for all ELLs and to enhance understanding and comprehension. SIFE students receive daily specific 
and differentiate guided and one-on-one instruction for 30 minutes during our intervention period. During this 30 minutes 
students are either involved in independent reading using the 100 Book Challenge in their native or second language, are 
involved in individual conferences with the teacher or are working in very small (no more than 3 students) strategy groups 
with the teacher. SIFE students also receive daily academic support from our bilingual technology teacher and from our 
literacy teacher. 
During the readers and the writers’ workshops, these students also receive guided instruction following the workshop model. 
During this time students are involved in highly organized activities that target the standards for ELA and ENL.  
The lessons for these students are differentiated according to their very specific learning needs throughout the day and in 
all content areas (math, science, social studies, etc.).     
Long Term ELL Students with interrupted formal education and who have been identified as long-term ELLs are provided with 
extra programs such as after school programs, intervention and differentiated instruction, differentiated language learning 
instruction and extra small group and individual/academic support. The programs for these students are tailored to their 
specific language learning needs and life needs. These programs are designed to strengthen their listening, speaking, writing 
and reading skills. These programs are taught by licensed bilingual and ENL teachers.  
  
Plan for Alternative Placement in Special Education 
•Give students enough time and effective support to develop socially and linguistically. 
•Carefully analyze students’ profile and evaluation (if necessary) to determine that lack of proper progress is the result of 
any disability and not lack of language development 
•Have meeting (school team) to determine the student’s level of proficiency (bilingual teacher, ESL teacher, Sp. Ed. Teacher, 
parent coordinator, School Support Team) 
•Notify parents and show them a concrete work plan for the student to receive the best support in the Sp. Ed. Class (with ENL 
or Bilingual services) 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

•Follow IEP recommendations as needed 
  
Transition Plan for Students Reaching Proficiency 
•Notify the parent of the success and give supporting documents. 
•Notify the classroom teacher and give supporting documents. 
•Give extra support (two years) through ESL services to ensure that the transitional period is a smooth and encouraging one.  
•Ensure a socially comfortable environment for them (especially those who move from bilingual classes into monolingual 
ones)   
•Provide with accommodations/support after acquiring proficiency level on the NYSESLAT: Accommodations will be provided 
as mandated for the first two years after proficiency has been acquired (i.e. extended time as per regulation).    
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Instructional strategies include more frequent and flexible use of TPR, role play, visual and graphic materials, usually to address 
a need for support in literacy development.  In many cases attention to oracy is needed as well.  Depending on the student, 
oral communication  may be given more attention using speech models to assist in comprehending how to say something, and 
restatement, to clarify utterances students produced.  Support for student repetition of modeled utterances and attention to 
speech needs (pronunciation, identifying needed sounds for writing, addressing confusions between letters and sounds, etc), 
mostly through scaffolding, modeling 
 and focused listening routines. 
  
Grade level materials for ELL-SWDs: Students are supplied with materials and grade level books in all of the content areas 
(e.g. S.S., Science, Math, Literature, etc.). We are also placing a lot of emphasis on academic language development and 
planning for instruction.   
All of our instruction in all content areas are highly conceptual, linguistically appropriate, and intellectually and 
analytically demanding. We strive to develop cognition, higher order thinking skills and use the depth of knowledge to plan 
questions and to develop academic language. Our instruction is highly contextualized and our activities and differentiated 
approach to support all ELLs regardless of their academic level and language acquisition, are carefully planned, evaluated and 
analyzed to enhance and enrich our students' comprehension and understanding of content.  
We teach all content areas with cognitive academic language in mind because we understand that this is the language that 
students need in order to participate in classroom discourse and to be able to read and comprehend grade level texts,  write 
academic essays and understand math language. 
ELLs who score proficient/commanding in the NYSESLAT will continue to receive academic suport from our certified teachers 
of ELLs for 2 years.    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
ELL students with disabilities whose IEP recommends ENL or bilingual instruction:  
English Language Learners who are receiving special education services and who are in either an ENL/Stand Alone or 
dual language program are grouped and taught in all content areas according to guidelines, learning needs, and 
NYSESLAT/NYSITLL 
 scores. At P.S. 54 our ELLs with disabilities are provided with ENL/Stand Alone services or are placed in our dual 
language program.  Students who are receiving ENL/Stand Alone/integrated instruction are grouped for instruction according 
to their grade and scores on the NYSESLAT in the four different components and receive instruction in English in the content 
areas using ENLmethodologies for the specific amount of time as determined by their NYSESLAT scores. In the DL program 
students are taught standards-based subject  matter instruction in the students’ native language (Spanish) and in the new 
Language (English) 50/50.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

Our targeted subgroups are SWDs-ELLs, SIFE, HO, long-term ELLs, newly identified "former" ELLs and "at-risk." 
  
Students who have been held over in a grade receive AIS (Academic Intervention Support) from specialized personnel who 
differentiate instruction that targets the students’ specific needs as per formative, summative, periodic and standardized 
assessments. These students also participate in our intervention period where they are grouped and     taught according to 
their needs. This intervention period is 30 minutes long and it's provided 5 days a week. During this intervention period 
students receive one-to-one guided instruction through individual conferences and small-targeted group instruction.  
They also receive “at risk” intervention from our Special Education Teacher Support Services (SETSS) and other special 
education licensed teachers who provide academic support as needed. In addition to this help, these students receive native 
language support as needed and ESL instruction as per their mandated time throughout the day.   
  
ELL students with interrupted, little or no formal schooling in their first language. 
The lessons for these students are differentiated according to their very specific learning needs throughout the day and in all 
content areas (math, science, social studies, etc.). Support is also provided in the child's language of communication.    
  
Long Term ELLs Students with interrupted formal education and who have been identified as long-term ELLs are provided with 
extra programs such as after school programs, intervention and differentiated instruction, differentiated language learning 
instruction and extra small group and individual/academic support. The programs for these students are tailored to their 
specific language learning needs and life needs. These programs are designed to strengthen their listening, speaking, writing 
and reading skills. These programs are taught by licensed bilingual and ENL teachers. . 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

No new programs in 2017-2018. 
 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

No programs/services for ELLs will be discontinued.   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
In addition to the mandated services that our students receive in both the second language and the native language, we have 
set in place other intervention programs. We are providing our students with differentiated, individual and small-group 
tutoring within the classroom as push in when the content areas are being taught (e.g. Literature during the readers and the 
writers' workshops, Science, S.S., Math). Groups are separated or differentiated according to their academic/language levels in 
the content area, academic level and language acquisition/dominance levels. The programs provided to ELLs are specifically 
designed for the ELL population and target four major components: reading, writing, speaking and listening. The students in 
these programs are  grouped according to their performance on the NYSESLAT and as per formative and summative 
assessments on reading, writing, listening and speaking in all content areas and the lessons are developed rigorously by highly 
qualified and fully certified teachers. All of our programs include special education students, long term ELLs and SIFE. 
  
Looking forward, we will continue to make sure that all our ELLs receive the services that they need both mandated and non-
mandated and that they have equal access to our school's resources, including technology and performing arts.  
All of our ELLs (DL, ENL, SWDs,), as well as students in regular education, are given opportunities to participate in all school 
programs regardless of language.  After school programs include Targeted ESL classes 3 times a week for 3 hours = 9 hours per 
week. Small group math AIS before and after school. 
These students also receive support from our Academic Support teachers, Academic Intervention Team, Instructional Support 
Team and Student Intervention Team. These teams are composed of highly competent teachers, school social workers and 
guidance counselors. They also receive “at risk” intervention from our Special Education Teacher Support Services (SETSS). 
All of our instructional programs are research-based and are provided by professionals who are knowledgeable about the 
learning needs of ELLs and how to address those needs.

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All ELLs have access to classroom libraries and grade level curriculum materials, just as non-ELLs do.  Specialized ENL materials 
are available and teachers may access these as needed.  Materials, mostly for literacy development in ENL include Rigby 
Guided Reaing for ELLs, Fountas and Pinnell, Into English, Award reading program, and NYSESLAT and Beyond. All ELLs have 
access to all technology in the building.  This technology includes laptop computers, Smart Boards, and iPads. 
At P.S. 54 we ensure equity in technology and instructional resources by providing equal access to computers, instructional 
technology, and other materials, such as books, text books in the content areas, that support native language and English 
language literacy development. All of our ELLs have access to our technology. Other technology/instructional supports our ELLs 
have access to and which are incorporated in their instruction in both the NL and ESL include: Smartboards, imacs, interactive 
whiteboards; laptop units are available in every classroom, IPADS are also being used in the instruction of ELLs and to support 
the intruction of content areas and the curriculum. ELLs also have access to eno boards, digital cameras, LCD, IPODS, and safari 
montage.  
Native language support is delivered in ESL and TBE in all content areas through dictionaries, materials in NL, books, text-
books, spoken, translations, technology(mentioned above). We also use the recommended language schedule for TBE from 
OELL. 
Resources: 
In order to better serve our ELL students in DL, Special education, ESL, we have purchased resources to be used in all of the 
content areas and during the regular school day (e.g. leveled bilingual libraries, Descubriendo el Espanol reading/writing 
program)        
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

We follow the 50/50 model in our DL classes and differentiate instruction according to the proficiency in the home language 
and the new language. 
Structure 
English- and Spanish-speaking children learn both their primary and a new language in an immersion environment.      
The languages of instruction are supported through the 50/50 model where the content areas (e.g. ELA, Math, Science and 
social Studies) are delivered and differentiated in the two languages (Spanish/English). The home language in our DL and ENL 
programs is supported through guided reading, read-a-louds, shared reading, vocabulary development, oral 
language,  guided/shared writing. Running records are done continuously to ensure understanding and progress in the native 
language in our dual language classes and ENL classes which is delivered in small 
groups.                                                                                                                         
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All services are provided by teachers certified for the grades, materials are matched to the grades and academic/language 
needs of the students.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
All ELLs have access to classroom libraries and grade level curriculum materials, just as non-ELLs do.  Specialized ENL materials 
are available and teachers may access these as needed.  Materials, mostly for literacy development in ENL include Rigby 
Guided Reaing for ELLs, Fountas and Pinnell, Into English, Award reading program, and NYSESLAT and Beyond. All ELLs have 
access to all technology in the building.  This technology includes laptop computers, Smart Boards, and iPads.

books, spoken, translations, technology(mentioned above). We also use the recommended language schedule for TBE from 
OELL. 
Resources: 
In order to better serve our ELL students in DL, Special education, ESL, we have purchased resources to be used in all of the 
content areas and during the regular school day (e.g. leveled bilingual libraries, Descubriendo el Espanol reading/writing 
program)        
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Plan for Newcomers: 
•We make sure that teachers (Bilingual, ENL and Monolingual Teachers) are well trained and experienced with ENL strategies 
and methodology and knowledgeable about second language acquisition. To ensure this, we have developed an ELL handbook 
which has been distributed to all teachers at P.S. 54. This handbook was distributed and explained during an ELL workshop at 
the beginning of the year. There have also been follow-up workshops.  
•Identify the family literacy level and make family members (siblings also) aware of how the system works and where the 
resources are to get help (school library, public library, Dial-A-Teacher in Spanish, parent coordinator, during school 
community meetings and assemblies, PTA meetings). 
•Use the first language score (where available) to differentiate our teaching. 
•Interview parents when they register the child: ask specific questions about the education system in the native country and 
how did the child do (if he went to school there). Parents are also invited to one-on-one meeting with the principal when 
students are being registered or attending school for the first time. 
•Administration of the Home Language Survey. 
Administration of the NYSITELL 
•Analyze student profiles. 
•Differentiated instruction and effective teaching strategies for ELLs. 
•Collaboration and planning between ESL and content area teachers. 
•Clear understanding of the students’ linguistic and cultural backgrounds. 
•Clear understanding of the student background knowledge and frame of reference and life experience. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

NA  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

a.) Self-Contained - One World/One Teacher - the model is 50%/50% language allocation 
b) The content areas are taught in English/Spanish 
c) instruction is separated by content, time, and curriculum. 
d) sequential literacy is taught.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Staff Development (2017-2018 and 2018-2019 activities). At least 50% of the PD time is dedicated to ENL/DL teachers and 15% 
PD hour for all other teachers. 
To ensure that the education provided to ELLs at P.S. 54 is of high standards and quality, the personnel of this school values 
ELLs, understands their linguistic, academic, cultural and life needs and prioritizes the social-emotional needs of these 
students. We ground our practice and teaching in research-based best practices that help us to enrich the lives of these 
students. We are always seeking ways to fully integrate the experiences of these students into the curriculum as we 
differentiate their instruction.  
To strengthen and improve our bilingual, ENL and non-bilingual teachers in the delivery of effective instruction for our ELL 
students, the principal, Dr. Ferreira, our Language coordinator, and our  ENL/Dual Language teachers (Ms. Luther, Ms. Costa, 
Ms. Pena, Ms. Perez) in conjunction with our ELL representative and with the office of DELLSS, offer professional development 
in instruction for ELLs and ELLs subgroups.  Our teachers are observed formally and informally to ensure quality and rigorous 
instruction designed for our ELL students and to ensure that they are planning using the common core standards, ENL and NLA 
standards. Through formal and informal observations, our teachers receive feedback that would help them to make their 
lessons more differentiated, meaningful, engaging and relevant to the needs of ELLs. 
Our programs and workshops are designed to provide all teachers of ELLs with strategies for teaching students who are ELLs in 
regular classes, DL and self-contained ENL classes, who are in special education and who are SIFE or long term ELLs. As per our 
Special education students, we provide instruction as per their IEP as well and the common core standards.  
We hold regular meetings to discuss assessments, students’ work, bilingual/ESL issues and to share new information about 
mandates, compliance; look at the different subgroups, the results of the Spanish Lab, the NYSESLAT, ELE, ELA and other 
summative and formative assessments. These workshop/learning opportunities are offered and facilitated by Dr. Ferreira. 
An ELL handbook is being created this year for all staff and the teachers of our English Language Learners. This handbook will 
contain information and resources that teachers can adapt for the instruction of ELLs in their classrooms.  
PDs for teachers of ELLs and ENL/DL teachers take place on Mondays during our PD time and throughout the year to enure 
that 50% of the PD targets ENL/DL teachers and that 15% targets all other teachers of ELL students (we follow a 6-8 week 
instructional cycles and cover all topics related to English Language Learners.  The Monday PDs for the first cycle: 
9/21/15; 9/11/17; 9/18/17; 9/25/17, 10/2/17, 10/16/17 and 10/23/17 . The next cycle will begin on 11/6/17 and will continue 
every Monday through 12/18/17 and every cycle until the end of the academic year.    
We  have study groups for the understanding of English Language Learners and SWDs and best practices, as well as 
Professional Learning Communities for ELLs’ mandated services (these study group meets every Tuesday). 
We hold regular meetings during common planning times to discuss assessments, students’ work, bilingual/ENL issues and to 
share new information about mandates, compliance; look at the different subgroups, analyze results from assessments such as 
the NYSESLAT, ELE, ELA and other summative and formative assessments.   
We also send our teachers to PD offered by colleges/universities, but most of all to those offered by the DELLSS department      
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Our guidance counselor has participated in workshops dealing with articulation from elementary school to middle school. 
These workshops include the application process, setting up meetings with the parents of the students in fifth grade to help 
them understand the process for selecting, enrolling and succeeding in middle school. The guidance counselor also helps 
distribute the directories and works closely with students and parents to ensure a smooth and successful transition from 
elementary to middle school. 
  
Our professional development workshops target all staffs at P.S. 54 ranging from paraprofessionals/educational assistants to 
social services/counselors,  social workers to classroom teachers and administrators. These workshops include

teaching/training our teachers/staff with strategies that would help the ELLs in their class and the ELLs they serve or that are 
assigned to them. These strategies include: Cultural sensitivity, Higher level thinking skills and study strategies for 
listening/speaking/reading/writing. Organizational and time management skills are also included in these workshops, as well 
as, strategies for information gathering and for increasing comprehension of printed materials. We also train our staff in how 
to use formal and informal assessments to differentiate instruction for ELLs at all English proficiency levels by creating lessons 
that target language and by providing multiple entry points to make sure that all of our ELLs, regardless of language 
proficiency, have access to the curriculum. We look at observation/feedback cycle, portfolios in all content areas, peer 
evaluation, oral reading, journals, interest inventory; conference logs in all content areas, rubrics in all content areas.     
During our PDs on Mondays we will make sure that we cover the requirements as set forth by CR PArt 154-2 of 15% of ELLs 
related PD for all teachers and 50% of ELLs related PD for bilingual/ENl teachers of ELLs 
All agendas and materials are stored in room 206  and the literacy coach maintains a binder with all information shared during 
the PDs. 
        
 
 

Parental Involvement 

 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
We will follow the ELL policy as it pertains to meeting annually with parents.  
The school will arrange to meet with the parents or guardians of English language learners at least once a year, in addition to 
parent-teacher conferences, initial parent orientations,  quarterly progress meetings or other scheduled meetings provided for 
parents or guardians, to discuss the goals of the program, their child’s language development progress, their child’s English 
language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. This additional meeting will 
include school staff (e.g. the teacher of the child, the provider if the child is receiving services, the administrators, 
etc)  necessary to sufficiently inform the parents or guardians about the child’s language development in all content areas in 
English and in the child’s home language in the case of students enrolled in a bilingual education program. Such meeting will 
be conducted with a qualified interpreter/translator in the language or mode of communication the parent or guardian best 
understands.  
  
We will schedule to meet with parents/or have phone conferences, if preferred or as needed in the preferred language of the 
parents, and will keep a log of attendance and/or phone calls. These meeting/phone calls may take place during the allotted 
parental engagement time of Tuesdays.    

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Every Tuesday, during parental engagement time, teachers of ELLs invite parents to meetings either individually or in groups to 
discuss academic/language concerns or areas of celebration.  Teachers/other providers also provide workshops on 
academic/language content.  
NYSESLAT workshop on NYSESLAT Report for parents will be provided throughout the year during the Tuesday Parental 
Engagement times. Understanding the CCSS and the shifts in literacy and mathematics in. How to Communicate and find 
learning/academic resources for parents of ELLs. . Understanding how ELLs learn. How to Read-A-Loud with your Child and ask 
meaningful and engaging questions. Parents are primary teachers. Read-A-Loud to your kids.  These workshops and learning 
opportunities will be offered by Dr. Ferreira, Mr. Eisma (translated by Ms. Aleman), our parent coordinator, Ms. Aleman. There 
will be other workshops for the parents during the month of March concerning the science exam (By Ms. Bisbano, the science 
teachers)and the math exam (by Mr. Eisma). These workshops will be offered in the morning and in the afternoon. Parents of 
ELLs are also attending ENL classes (2017) most probably every Wednesdays at 8:00 offered by the school and taught by an 
ELLs expert. Spanish classes will be offered beginning in December 2017. These classes will be offered to Spanish-speaking 
parents who would like to learn how to read and write in their own language. Likewise, English classes will be offered to 
English-speaking parents who would like to learn and read in their native language. Our hope is that if parents of ELLs are 
literate in their own language this would help to advance our ELLs' academic language and academic success. The principal, Dr.

Ferreira, has also scheduled workshops on Danielson. She will be addressing competency 3b and helping parents understand 
and learn how to ask their child questions and involve them in discussions and debates. These workshops are scheduled for 
December 2017. The workshops will be differentiated by language (Spanish/English). All workshops will be done in this manner 
to enhance understanding and differentiation as per the needs of the parents of our community.    
 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
The parents of ELLs are encouraged and regularly informed and invited to visit the school and to be part of their child's educational 
life through attendance celebrations, Character Trait/Students of the Month celebrations, through Data meeting involving the 
teachers, the students, the administrators and the parents and through our curriculum nights, PA meeting and parent engagement 
activities such as "Mommy and Me" which is an activity where parents and their children are invited to read. Parents are also 
engaged in activities such as NYCARES, garden Helpers, Cook shop from Cornell University and its healthy eating program.  
  
Student life, including the social-emotional well-being, is the center of our school and we do all that we can and beyond to ensure 
that all of our students are served accordingly and have equal opportunities to succeed. 
The "I Speak" card has been distributed and posted throughout the school.  
My staff is aware and continuously informed of the translation and interpretation policies and communicates with the office and

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Marybelle Ferreira, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

At P.S. 54 we use the HLIS, and through an interview process, to assess the need for translation and interpretation 
for our families. 

The ELLs coordinator and the language access coordinator/parent coordinator act as liaisons with 
parents/guardians to determine what the translation/interpretation needs of the school are and communicate 
those needs to the administration and other personnel of the school such as the School Based Support Team, 
Attendance Team, etc. . 

 

Our ELLs coordinator and ENL push-in/pull-out teacher are members of our registration team. They interview 
parents and administer the home language survey as needed. The information obtained from the home language 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76 

 

survey is used to determine the language of preference of parents. It also provides us with information about the 
home language of the parents/guardians and students. 

At registration, and in the emergency contact "blue card" of each child, the parents/guardians identify the 
language they prefer to receive information either in oral or/and in written forms and this information is entered 
in ATS. 

 

To further identify the language needs of our community, we look a t the RHLA/RAPL/RCPL on a regular basis to 
make sure that the language needs/preferred language of communication of every member of this community is 
met. 

Parents on the SLT provide additional insights as to the new language needs of our community as well as 
classroom and out of classroom personnel. 

Parent Association provides us with information about the language needs of parents during 
meetings/conferences. 

Translation is provided during PA meetings, conferences, meetings with teachers, SBST meetings, counselors, 
providers and Principal's meetings, as needed. 

During meetings with staff and during parent-teacher conferences, translation/interpretation is provided in the 
language of preference and as requested by the staff and/or the parents. 

Our procedure for ensuring that important documents are translated and sent home in the language of 
preference, allows us to keep communication with the community we serve.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Since we know the languages spoken by 
our community and also know who will 
need interpretation/translation, we 
arrange and make appointments and the 
utilization of the 1800 number and as 
needed, we would utilize the assistance of 
un-house staff and family members over 
the age of 18. 

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In the event of a school emergency, emails are sent in multiple languages (would utilize Google translate as needed 
since an emergency requires prompt actions) . The information will also be posted in our school website. Phone calls 
are also made in English, Spanish, and French. The school community will be directed to contact 311. We also use our 
messaging system to inform the community of any emergency. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

During our Staff meeting at the beginning of every school year, I will inform my staff of chancellors' regulation A-663. 
Information and copies of this regulation is included in the staff handbook and the school policy folder which they 
receive at the beginning of every year. Teachers are also informed of the services provided and are reminded to 
inform and contact our Parent Coordinator/LAC if they will need translation during the parental engagement times 
that take place every Tuesday or for any other meetings where translation will be needed. Teachers are always made 
aware of the interpretation/translation services provided and the numbers to call as needed. 

 

During our PD times, teachers are also made aware via the LAC and the ELLs coordinator of such services and the 
mandates of the regulations of the chancellor A-663. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Within the first 30 days of a student enrollment, we determine the primary language spoken by the families/guardians 
of our students and provide translation and interpretation services to all of the families/guardians who require 
language translations that would allow them to communicate with the school effectively.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          80 

 

 

We use the information as provided by the RCPL to ensure that all staff know the languages spoken by the parents of 
our students and be able to provide translations as needed.  

 

We provide translation services as needed and if requested, a relative or any other adult may serve as the translator if 
requested by the parent/guardian. 

 

So that parents are aware of their right to receive information in their preferred language, DOE signs indicating the 
different languages spoken are posted throughout the school and specifically in the main office, security desks and all 
entrances.  

 

Parents are also made aware of these services during assemblies, meetings, and workshops. 

 

We follow the regulations outlined in the Chancellor’s Regulations A-663. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Members of the school community are informed that they can access translated information from the DOE public 
website. 

Twice a year, we send surveys to parents to gather feedback on the different services we provide. These surveys are 
provided in multiple languages as I would use the assistance of in-house staff and members of the community over 
the age of 18 to help with translation and interpretation.  

During our monthly parent association meeting we gather information from parents pertaining to the availability and 
quality of services provided by the school. 

Emails are sent regularly to parents (weekly) and parents are encouraged to email us with concerns or questions they 
may have pertaining to the school and the services we provide. 

We also do a needs assessment twice a year to gather feedback from our community. 

We look at the environment/learning survey to gather feedback from our parents and to assess our practice and the 
services and programs we provide.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          81 

 

The School Leadership Team which is comprised of representatives of parents and school staff, always look into how 
to make our communication with limited English proficient parents more transparent and that would reach everyone. 

To further improve language services, we provide parents with the school manual (Parent Manual) and within it they 
will find information on how to receive translation and interpretation services and their rights to such.
