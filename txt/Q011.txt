Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The mission of P.S. 11 is for our students to be able to communicate across modalities in a range of genres, with and 
for diverse audiences and purposes. This includes encouraging our students to become well rounded learners and 
reach achievement to their highest potential in all academic areas. Also, we want our students to become cooperative 
learners with their peers.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Public School 11, Queens is located in, a residential/commercial neighborhood of newly arrived immigrants. We are 
situated in an area that is culturally diverse. During a neighborhood walk you can enjoy the smell of Colombian bread 
baking, hear the voices of men from the Turkish center, and a few steps away admire the beauty and peace of a 
Muslim mosque. Among its 1100 students in 44 classes, approximately 26% are English Language Learners and 27% 
are students with disabilities. 

It is a culturally diverse school that serves students in grades K-6. We are one of the few schools in NYC that continues 
to serve sixth graders. Parents are glad their children have the opportunity to enjoy one more year in an elementary 
school setting. Our teachers are committed to our students and there is a very low turnover rate. Our teachers 
dedicate their teaching years to P.S. 11 and leave when it is time for their retirement. The strong commitment to P.S. 
11 creates tight ties with the families of the community. 

Our programs include Self-Contained Special Education, Integrated Co-Teaching, Free - Standing English as a Second 
Language, Bilingual Education in Grades K, 1, and 2, Honors Class in Fourth Fifth and Sixth Grades, and our Heritage 
Program in all grades. Students in the Heritage Program are learning Spanish as a second language and/or the culture 
and traditions of Latin American and Spanish countries. We are fortunate enough to have Specialized Art Teachers, 
Visual Arts and Music; two Physical Education teachers; and two Technology teachers. Our Science teacher works in 
collaboration with our classroom teachers to provide a hands-on approach to Science. Our students have a 93% 
passing rate on the NYS Science exam and a 67% of those students scored at a level 4! Our Art teachers expose our K-
6 students to a variety of artists and our students create authentic art pieces inspired by the artists. They work with 
students in their own “Art Gallery” rooms. The P.S. 11 Chorus visits and sings at community centers, such as the 
Queens Boulevard Extended Care Center and always makes special events extra special. We have a “Runners Club” 
which encourages our students to be active and follow a healthy life style. Last year, they have participated in several 
NYC runs throughout the five boroughs. Our Guidance Counselors work closely with teachers and students to assure a 
safe and supportive learning environment. In collaboration with a Community Based Organization, Woodside on the 
Move, our students are given the opportunity to participate in an after-school program that provides enrichment 
activities, performing arts, and homework help. 

We are fortunate to receive support through the arts utilizing grants. P.S. 11 specifically works with CityLore to 
incorporate arts instruction. We also worked with the American Ballet Theatre and students learned ballet during the 
2017 -2018 school year. 

We are very proud of the well-rounded education provided to our students. We feed each student’s mind, body, and 
imagination. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

P.S. 11 has an English as a New Language student population of about 26% for the entire student body. This 
percentage does not include students that are former ENL learners and have passed the NYSESLAT with a 
“commanding” score. Our ENL student needs are to have qualified ENL teachers and Bilingual pedagogues to help 
meet their needs. These teachers may also be licensed in “Common Branch.” Aside from teacher qualifications, these 
students need to be immersed in classes that have high oral language tasks where students learn to communicate in 
content vocabulary rich lessons. Our ELL student population needs to learn with teacher created visual charts and 
tables so they can visualize the lessons they are engaged in. Our ELL student population needs to learn with 
manipulative such as, base-ten blocks, pattern blocks, and counters so they may engage and explain mathematical 
thinking and reasoning. Our ENL student population needs to learn using special technologies, such as, Promethean 
Board, laptops, and iPads in order to support their need for visual learning and manipulation of learning materials. In 
conjunction with learning in the classroom, our ENL population needs to experience learning outside of the classroom 
environment. These students meet their learning needs when class trips are organized by our classroom teachers. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

These class trips help our ENL population make connections with our Social Studies curriculum, Social Studies tasks, 
Science curriculum, and Science tasks. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

For the 2017 -2018 school year, P.S. 11 made progress in creating, Strong Family-Community Ties. This element in the 
Framework for Great Schools shows how the principal brings resources from the community into the school building 
by welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based 
organizations. Resources include Woodside on the Move After School Program, class trips to local restaurants and 
shoppes, class trips to the local firehouse and library, and inviting members of the Woodside community and school 
community to family night.  

According to the Fall Principal’s Performance Observation Visit, conducted December 11, 2017, it was noted: 

[P.S. 11 does] an amazing job in creating a positive school culture. This year when [P.S. 11] opened the new building, 
[our] staff, safety agent and assistant principals worked together to ensure a smooth opening. On day one [the 
principal] ensured that all school staff were well prepared with information to guide parents to new entrances and 
meeting places. Staff was equipped with class lists and charts containing drop-off and pick-up points to communicate 
to families. Teachers and staff were smiling and welcoming students, the same as on the day of this school visit. 
[When the principal visits classrooms, she is] able to call students by name and references information about their 
parents and/or siblings. 

For the 2017 -2018 school year, P.S. 11 progress in, teacher collaboration. This element in the Framework for Great 
Schools highlights teacher commitment to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. Teachers 
have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 

According to the Fall Principal’s Performance Observation Visit, conducted December 11, 2017, it was noted: 

[P.S. 11 has] consistently raised the level of expectations within classrooms. Most importantly [we] provide staff with 
material, resources and professional learning to meet these expectations. In addition, [staff] wisely solicited input and 
brainstormed ideas with members from all constituent groups which led to buy-in from your community and 
refinement of ideas. The school continues to send progress reports to families three times per year and parents have 
access to student information via NYC School Accounts. Staff members meet on a monthly basis to discuss school-
wide issues or concerns, school goals and professional learning plans. City Lore teaching artists assist students with 
interviewing skills. They practice how to interview and write their own questions to interview each other. Students 
also go on neighborhood walks with teaching artists to meet and speak with local businesses.  

Our key area of focus for the 2018 – 2019 school year is to improve, Rigorous Instruction. As a school we plan to 
create an instructional environment where students are challenged through vocabulary rich conversations in which 
the teacher and students facilitate discussion. Our key focus is to have students frequently engaged in deep, 
meaningful conversations. During these conversations we expect students to be actively engaged in ambitious 
intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. This is aligned to the Advanced Literacy Skills approach to 
teaching literacy in our classrooms.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
P.S. 11 has conducted a comprehensive needs assessment aligned with The Framework for Great Schools by focusing 
on the element, Rigorous Instruction. In the element of Rigorous Instruction, instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. In the element of Rigorous Instruction, high 
standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and students are 
developing their own critical thinking skills. In order to address P.S. 11’s needs in Rigorous Instruction, the School 
Leadership Team considered qualitative data sources, such as written feedback given from the Principal Performance 
Observations for the 2017 – 2018 school year.  

The information is summarized below: 

1. Strengths in element of Rigorous Instruction... 

Data Source- Principal Performance Observation Fall 2017 

Finding: [The school principal has] consistently raised the level of expectations within classrooms. Most importantly 
[she] provides staff with the material, resources and professional learning to meet those expectations. 

2. Priorities and needs that will be addressed...  

Data Source- Fall 2017 Principal Performance Observation 

Finding: Based on the most recent NYS Report Card, based on 2016-17 assessment data P.S. 11 did not meet Annual 
Yearly Progress (AYP) in ELA or mathematics for students with disabilities and English language learners. You are 
demonstrating growth and progress, however the growth for these subgroups is not sufficient to keep pace with the 
Effective Annual Measureable Objectives (EAMO) targets established by NYSED. 

Data Source- 2017 Principal Performance Observation 

Finding: Continue to work with teachers on improving assessment practices within instruction. Discuss with teachers 
the importance of checking in with ALL students when they are working independently or in groups. Teachers should 
be looking for common errors and/or misconceptions made by students. This will allow them to strategically circulate 
and quickly check in with all students. The teacher should ask students to check and justify the reason for their

answer. Teachers should circulate and recirculate their classrooms to check for student misunderstanding, address 
and instruct student misunderstanding, and, finally, reassess student misunderstanding. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, teachers will strengthen student engagement and student assessment techniques within instruction. 
Effective student engagement and effective assessment techniques will be measured using the Advance Rating System, 
specifically targeting 3B: Questioning and Discussion Techniques and 3D: Using Assessment Within Instruction.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Our Math Coach, Literacy Coach, Instructional Leaders, and the 
Universal Literacy Coach will provide professional development 
cycles for all teachers. The goal of the professional development 
cycle is to increase teachers’ pedagogical practices to ensure 
students use critical thinking skills, show reasoning, and are 
challenged within instruction. 

ELL teachers will push-in during ELA instruction to provide 
support in vocabulary and language development. Teachers will 
push-in during Math instruction to provide support in math 
vocabulary and language development.  

P.S. 11 administration, lead teachers, and the Parent Coordinator 
will host parent meetings and workshops explaining the 
academic needs of their children. These workshops will increase 
parent awareness, understanding, and capacity to assist their 
children at home when participating with their children in 
mathematical activities.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
P.S. 11 has conducted a comprehensive needs assessment aligned with The Framework for Great Schools by focusing 
on the element, Supportive Environment. In the element of Supportive Environment, students are excited to learn and 
are actively engaged in their classrooms. In a supportive environment, classrooms are welcoming, safe, and orderly. In 
a supportive environment, students support each other and are part of the creation of a collaborative and respectful 
atmosphere in the classroom. The classroom must support the social and emotional growth of all students. We 
analyzed qualitative data sources such as the Principal Performance Observation for the 2017 -2018 school year. The 
information is summarized below: 

1. Strengths in element of Supportive Environment… 

Data Source- Principal Performance Observation Fall 2017 

Finding: [P.S. 11 does a fine] job in creating a positive school culture. [In September 2017, P.S. 11] opened the new 
building. [The] staff, safety agent and assistant principals worked together to ensure a smooth opening. [The 
principal] ensured that all school staff were well prepared with information to guide parents to new entrances and 
meeting places. Staff was equipped with class lists and charts containing drop-off and pick-up points to communicate 
to families. Teachers and staff were smiling and welcoming students. As classroom visits were made, [the principal 
was] able to call students by name and referenced information about their parents and/or siblings. Within classrooms 
there were clear, structures and routines. For example, in all classrooms, student-friendly learning targets were 
posted and visible. 

Data Source- Principal Performance Observation Fall 2017 

Finding: [The school principal has] consistently raised the level of expectations within classrooms. Most importantly 
[she] provides staff with the material, resources and professional learning to meet those expectations. 

 

2. Priority that will be addressed...  

Data Source- Principal Performance Observation Fall 2017 

Finding: As a next step, it was recommended in the Fall PPO, P.S. 11 should continue to work with teachers on 
improving assessment practices within instruction. [Administration should] discuss with teachers the importance of 
checking in with ALL students when they are working independently or in groups. Teachers should be looking for 
common errors and/or misconceptions made by students. This will allow them to strategically circulate and quickly 
check in with all students. The teacher should ask students to check and justify the reason for their answer. Teachers 
should circulate and recirculate their classrooms to check for student misunderstanding, address and instruct student

misunderstanding, and, finally, reassess student misunderstanding. This practice will enable students to be challenged 
by their teachers and supported in their learning.  

Finding: As a next step, it was recommended [we] identify and leverage students on the cusp of proficiency levels 1 / 
2 and 2 / 3. [Teachers should] assess students to identify sub-skill areas of deficiency, provide targeted interventions 
based on individual needs and closely monitor individual growth and progress.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, at least 75% of all P.S. 11 teachers will be rated “effective” or higher in questioning and discussion 
techniques. Teachers will be rated “effective” at least once using the Advanced Rating System and given appropriate 
feedback to improve the meaningful discussion taking place, if necessary. This goal will be measured using the 
Danielson Rubric 2013; Component 3b: Questioning and Discussion Techniques..

Parents will have the opportunity to attend workshops and attend conferences with their child’s teacher to gain an 
understanding of the expectations in student learning. During these conferences, forms of assessments used within 
the teacher’s instruction and standardized measurements will be addressed. The timeline will be during the 2018 – 
2019 school year. One of the key personnel includes the teacher. The teacher will hold conferences during Parent 
Teacher Conferences and during any Tuesday afternoon during the parent engagement time. Another key personnel 
includes the Parent Coordinator. Throughout the school year, the Parent Coordinator may hold workshops, or when

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

P.S. 11 has conducted a comprehensive needs assessment aligned with The Framework for Great Schools by focusing 
on the element, Collaborative Teachers. In the element of Collaborative Teachers, teachers are committed to the 
success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.  
We analyzed qualitative data sources such as the Principal Performance Observation for the 2017 -2018 school year. 
The information is summarized below: 

 

1. Strengths in the element of Collaborative Teachers…  

 

Data Source- Principal Performance Observation Fall 2017 

Finding: Over the last three years, [school administrations has] consistently raised the level of expectations within 
classrooms. Most importantly [it has] provided staff with the material, resources and professional learning to meet 
those expectations. In addition, [P.S. 11] wisely solicited input and brainstormed ideas with members from all 
constituent groups which led to buy-in from your community and refinement of ideas. For example, when [P.S. 11] 
decided to change the writing curriculum, [the school] had a team of teachers evaluate curriculum and make 
recommendations. Following a team piloted the program and was then able to refine and help explain the benefits of 
the new program to other staff members.  

 

Data Source- Principal Performance Observation Fall 2017 

Finding: School goals align with resources and accurately reflect the needs of students and staff. To meet these goals 
[the principal] allocated funds to maintain a math coach position and for teachers to attend professional learning. 
Teams strategically look at student work/data and use it to refine curriculum and share effective practices that they 
have tried and achieved success or they share a challenge and seek advice/suggestions from colleagues. 

 

 

2. Priority that will be addressed...

Data Source- Principal Performance Observation Spring 2018  

Finding: In evaluating NYS Report Card that was released in December 2017, there is concern about the lack of growth 
for Limited English Proficient (LEP) students and Students with Disabilities (SWDs). [P.S. 11’s] Performance Index (PI) 
for these sub-groups actually decreased significantly [during the 2016 – 2017 school year], with LEPs moving from 51 
to 44 and SWDs moving from 64 to 58. This is of considerable concern as the Effective Annual Measure Objectives 
(EAMO) targets increased by 12 and 11 points, respectively for these sub-groups. [Furthermore,] it is imperative [P.S. 
11] continue[s] to evaluate the rigor of curriculum materials and pedagogical practices in all classrooms servicing 
these students. Most importantly, [it was suggested in the PPO we] implement a monitoring system that will allow 
[us] to assess accurately student growth at designated intervals throughout the school year. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, at least 80% of P.S. 11 teachers will be rated effective, or higher, in collaborating as teachers and growing 
and developing professionally as measured by Advance Measures of Teacher Practice Teacher Evaluation System 
Component 4e: Growing and Developing Professionally, which will support academic inquiry and will encourage 
teachers to share best teaching practices to foster student growth and achievement. There will be an emphasis on 
instructional support for ELLs and students with disabilities within the professional learning cycles.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Our Math Coach, Literacy Coach, Instructional Leaders, and the 
Universal Literacy Coach will provide 3 professional development 
sessions to all teachers. The overarching goal of the professional 
development series is to increase teachers’ pedagogical 
knowledge to ensure support for current ELLs, former ELLs, and 
students with special needs. During these professional 
development sessions, teachers, administration, and specialized 
pedagogues will share best practices on valuable ways to assess 
students in their learning and how to use these assessments as 
data to drive further instruction. This will be done for both, ELA 
and Math. Teacher teams will work together to create a grade-
wide units of study or content area unit of study, performance 
tasks, and hold discussions on best teaching practices. 

 

Administrators and teachers will engage in professional 
conversation about how to best assist their colleagues in student 
achievement for ALL students: ELLs, former ELLs, and students 
with special needs. Teachers will be encouraged to become 
resources and collect data in student growth. Teachers will share 
best practices amongst teachers on their grade and share best 
practices with administrators. Administrators will engage 
teachers in “horizontal” studies regarding student growth, 
student achievement, and best teaching practices.  

ESL teachers will contribute to the Kindergarten through Grade 6 
studies and data collection regarding student growth, student 
achievement, and best teaching practices by collaborating with 
the classroom teachers of the students they service. ESL teachers 
will engage in professional conversation with administration 
regarding student growth, student achievement, and best 
teaching practices. Our ESL department will spend most of their 
instructional time “pushing into” classes rather than, “pulling 
students out,” or their classroom.  

P.S. 11 administration, lead teachers, and the Parent Coordinator 
will host parent meetings and workshops explaining the 
academic needs of their children. These workshops will increase 
parent awareness, understanding, and capacity to assist their

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Collaborative Teachers and strategies 
to promote teacher-parent/family collaborations in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and 
identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
Parents will have the opportunity to attend workshops and attend conferences with their child’s teacher to gain an 
understanding of the element of, “Collaborative Teachers” and learning strategies implemented in their child’s 
classroom and among our educators. The time line will be during the school year. One of the key personnel includes 
the classroom teacher. The teacher will hold conferences during Parent Teacher Conferences in November and March 
and during any Tuesday afternoon during the parent engagement time. Two other key personnel includes the Parent 
Coordinator and administration. Throughout the school year, the Parent Coordinator and administration may hold 
workshops, or when necessary, hold conferences with parents explaining the expectations of a collaborative school 
environment and how to maintain teacher expectations, school – wide expectations, and the expectations of the 
learning environment at home for the child to experience continuity. During these meetings, parents may gain an 
understanding of best teaching practices experienced with other students with similar academic needs.

P.S. 11 has conducted a comprehensive needs assessment aligned with The Framework for Great Schools by focusing 
on the element, Effective School Leadership. In the element of Effective School Leadership, principals lead by example 
and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-
emotional support that drives student achievement. P.S. 11 administration will nurture the [professional growth of 
teachers by creating a professional environment for teachers to develop and enhance their craft of teaching. As P.S. 
11 leaders nurture teachers’ professional growth, this will help teachers to deliver meaningful instruction to students 
and will drive student achievement. We analyzed qualitative data sources such as the Principal Performance 
Observation for the 2017 -2018 school year. The information is summarized below: 

 

1. Strengths in element of Effective School Leadership 

 

Data Source- Principal Performance Observation Fall 2017 

Finding: [The school principal does] an amazing job in creating a positive school culture. This year (the September 
2017 – June 2018 school year) when [the principal] opened the new building, [the] staff, safety agent and assistant 
principals worked together to ensure a smooth opening. On day one [the principal] ensured that all school staff were 
well prepared with information to guide parents to new entrances and meeting places. Staff was equipped with class 
lists and charts containing drop-off and pick-up points to communicate to families. Teachers and staff were smiling 
and welcoming students, the same as on the day of [the] school visit. As [the Borough Field Support Center personnel 
and the principal] visited classrooms, [the principal was] able to call students by name and referenced information 
about their parents and/or siblings. Within classrooms there were clear, structures and routines. For example, in all 
classrooms, student-friendly learning targets were posted and visible.

Finding: Over the last three years, [the principal has] consistently raised the level of expectations within classrooms. 
Most importantly [the principal has] provided staff with the material, resources and professional learning to meet 
those expectations. In addition, [the principal] solicited input and brainstormed ideas with members from all

the new program to other staff members. [This has developed] teacher leaders [in P.S. 11] which has led to greater 
teacher ownership of the curriculum.  

 

Data Source- Principal Performance Observation Fall 2017 

Finding: [The principal] allocated funds to maintain a math coach position and for teachers to attend professional 
learning. Teams strategically look at student work/data and use it to refine curriculum and share effective practices 
that they have tried and achieved success or they share a challenge and seek advice/suggestions from colleagues. 

 

 

2. Priority that will be addressed... 

Data Source- Principal Performance Observation Spring 2018 

Finding: [It was suggested the principal should] work with teachers on improving pedagogical practices, including 
conducting on-going checks for student understanding within lessons. [The administration should encourage] 
teachers [conduct inter-visitations and] visit the classrooms of those teachers that effectively monitor student 
learning during lessons. As [the principal and her fellow administrators] observe teachers, [they should] be sure that 
[to] follow up and provide feedback on the progress the teacher has made on the next steps contained in their prior 
observation.  

Finding: [It was suggested the principal should] continuously evaluate the rigor and pedagogical practices in the 
classrooms servicing LEP and SWD students. Most importantly, [leadership in P.S. 11 should] implement a monitoring 
system that will allow [the school] to monitor, by sub-group, students’ growth at designated intervals throughout the 
school year. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, effective school leadership will be measured through two school surveys created by the Professional 
Development Committee, Instructional Cabinet, and School Leadership Team. These surveys will measure if the 
Professional Development Committee and Instructional Cabinet have met, or paved a path, to ensure the professional 
growth of teachers and paraprofessionals. These surveys will help the Professional Development Committee and 
Instructional Cabinet create, develop and deliver the instructional and social-emotional support in classrooms that will 
foster and all drive student achievement, including current ELLs, former ELLs, and students with disabilities.

strategies parents can use and implement to support their own leadership at home, as parents. Another key 
personnel includes the Parent Coordinator. Throughout the school year, the Parent Coordinator may hold workshops, 
or when necessary, hold conferences with parents explaining how they can become effective leaders in their homes 
and foster their child’s academic needs and social and emotional growth. During any parent meeting or workshop and 
during any PTA meeting, the school principal will be made available and participate in the parent and school 
discussion to ensure parents and families are a stakeholder in the “Effective School Leadership” discussion.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

P.S. 11 has conducted a comprehensive needs assessment aligned with The Framework for Great Schools by focusing 
on the element, Strong Family and Community Ties. In the element of Strong Family and Community Ties, school 
leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by welcoming, encouraging, and developing 
partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. For the 2018 – 2019 school year, P.S. 11 
will create a welcoming environment for families to enrich the lives of our students.  

We analyzed qualitative data sources such as the Principal Performance Observation for the 2017 -2018 school year. 
The information is summarized below: 

 

1. Strengths in the element of Strong Family and Community Ties… 

 

Data Source- Principal Performance Observation Fall 2017 

Finding: [The principal does] an amazing job in creating a positive school culture. This year when [P.S. 11] opened the 
new building, [P.S. 11] staff, safety agent and assistant principals worked together to ensure a smooth opening. On 
day one [the principal] ensured that all school staff were well prepared with information to guide parents to new 
entrances and meeting places. Staff was equipped with class lists and charts containing drop-off and pick-up points to 
communicate to families. Teachers and staff were smiling and welcoming students, the same as on the day of this 
school visit.  

 

Data Source- Principal Performance Observation Fall 2017 

Finding: The school continues to send progress reports to families three times per year and parents have access to 
student information via NYC School Accounts. Staff members meet on a monthly basis to discuss school-wide issues or 
concerns, school goals and professional learning plans. City Lore teaching artists assist students with interviewing 
skills. They practice how to interview and write their own questions to interview each other. Students also go on 
neighborhood walks with teaching artists to meet and speak with local businesses.  

 

This was not listed in any of the Principal Performance Observations, P.S. 11 invites the parents during the school day 
to participate in class activities with their children. During the 2017 – 2018 school year, parents were invited to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          31 

 

complete a Valentine’s Day math word problem, parents were invited to conduct play in vocabulary games in their 
child’s classroom, and parents were invited to create a “link – chain” of kindness. Furthermore, parents had a 
fantastic time during the May Family Night. Many families brought and sampled homemade foods from around the 
world, enjoyed a City Lore performance, and visited with staff and other members of the P.S. 11 community. P.S. 11 
works collaboratively with the Community Based Organization, Woodside on the Move, to strengthen its ties to the 
Woodside community and all its members.  

 

2. Priority that will be addressed… 

Neither Principal Performance Observation addressed any concern regarding P.S. 11’s family and community ties. As a 
school, P.S. 11 administrators we will continue to invite parents and members of the community into our school and 
celebrate our students’ milestones in education and social emotional growth.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, effective strong family and community ties will be measured through two parent surveys. These surveys 
will ask questions that measure how well the school’s articulates the school’s goals and how well student expectations 
are articulated. We will collect at least one hundred responses from our parents.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Parent Teacher Association (PTA) will hold monthly meetings 
that discuss community events that will take place in Woodside.  

Parent Coordinator will hold workshops with the school Literacy 
Coach. During these workshops, the topics of discussion will be 
about the shift from the Common Core Learning Standards to the 
Next Generation Standards. During these workshops, parents 
gain an understanding of the student expectations in each grade 
and gain an understanding of student expectations on the New 
York State ELA exam.

Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
One of the resources we will use is the Administration as a resource to articulate the partnership between the 
parents and the school community must exist, evolve, and be supported. All P.S. 11 staff, teachers, and 
paraprofessionals will articulate this message through invitations to class events, school assemblies, and Family Night 
or Parent Teacher Conferences in the evening or on Tuesday afternoons.  

Another resource will be our PTA. We will ask the association to help support our parent engagement events. As in 
2018 -2019 school year, the PTA has provided refreshments during Family Night’s at P.S. 11. The PTA has also 
provided valuable information and community resources to our parents, such as, legal advice or healthcare providers 
in the neighborhood to meet the needs of our children.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
P.S. 11 has continued a close relationship with Queens College (CUNY), St. John’s University, Adelphi University, and 
LaGuardia Community College. P.S. 11 has many student teachers and interns from these schools. In partnership with 
these institutions, P.S. 11 guides these promising educators to become part of the NYCDOE and take an active role in 
our students’ education. Based on classroom teacher observations and student teacher and/or intern motivation, and 
after licensing and certification is complete, P.S. 11 will often invite these teachers as staff by becoming substitute 
teachers.  

In order to retain our teachers, give proper assignments to our teachers, and support our teachers we have an 
instructional cabinet that consists of three assistant principals, a math coach, a literacy coach, an ENL teacher, a 
special education teacher, a speech teacher, and a paraprofessional. Together, the instructional cabinet surveys all 
teachers frequently to organize effective professional development to best meet their needs as educators in order to 
help them grow professionally and hone their craft of teaching. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
First, P.S. 11 creates an instructional cabinet. This year, the instructional cabinet consists of three assistant principals, 
a math coach, a literacy coach, an ESL teacher, a special education teacher, a speech teacher, and a paraprofessional.  

Second, the principal sets forth major goals for students to achieve based on the Principal’s Performance Review, the 
Quality Review (if available), and the School Learning Survey.  

Once the principal has communicated her goals for the 2018 – 2019 school year which includes:  

  Higher frequency of oral language and in – depth conversation and communication skills made by students 
  Higher scores on NYS Math and ELA 
  ENL students to increase at least one level on NYSESLAT 
 

Students engaged in higher-order thinking; students engaged in differentiated learning tasks; and teachers 
using data to drive instruction  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

Furthermore, the school principal articulates her intent for teachers have time to reflect on where their strengths are 
and where they have a need for professional development. Together, the instructional cabinet surveys all teachers 
frequently to organize effective professional development to best meet their needs as educators in order to help 
them grow professionally and hone their craft of teaching. This process is repeated three times a school year. 

P.S. 11 uses the expertise of model teachers to conduct professional development on best teaching practices: i.e. a 
third grade teacher asks frequent higher-order thinking questions during her lessons in order to engage students in 
critical thinking skills; creates differentiated tasks in order to challenge some of her students and scaffold others.  

P.S. 11 uses the expertise of a math coach and literacy coach to conduct professional development in grade specific 
subject areas. The assistant principal also schedules occupational therapists to conduct professional development for 
special education teachers and for general education teachers to teach with behavioral modification techniques.  

During the 2018 -2019, P.S. 11 will pilot a Professional Development program utilizing two teachers. This pilot 
program was an initiative created by the Superintendent. The Instruction Leaders will be a third grade teacher and a 
fifth grade teacher. These teachers will attend frequent district meetings. These teachers will also facilitate 
professional development within P.S. 11 teachers and paraprofessionals.  

 

 
Part 3: TA Schools Only 

3a. Use of Program Resources 

Describe how the TA program resources will assist participating children to meet proficiency. 
. 

 

 
3b. TA Coordination with the Regular Program 

Describe the planning, coordination and support of the TA program with the regular educational program (i.e., 
providing ELT, accelerated, high-quality curriculum, including applied learning; and minimize removing children from 
the regular classroom during regular school day). 
. 

 

 
 
 
 
 
Part 4: SWP Schools Only 

4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)  

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
 

In order to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to P.S. 11, we encourage our Kindergarten 
teachers to create lesson plans and a Kindergarten environment where an abundance of social learning takes place. In 
December 2017 the principal organized a “Welcome Kindergarten” meeting to encourage future enrollment at P.S. 11 
for the 2018 -2019 schoolyear. In June 2018, the principal organized a parent orientation where parents of our 2018 
Kindergarten students visited the school. The future Kindergarten 2018 students were invited, as well. During that 
meeting, the principal explained many of the practices that take place during the school year: safety drills, routines 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

part of the school day, the Common Core Learning Standards, and curriculum and programs. The principal introduced 
the administration, the Parent Coordinator, the school nurse, and members of the school-based support team. The 
principal also explained the importance of parental involvement through being active members of the PTA and 
engaging with their child’s teacher during parent teacher conferences and on Tuesday afternoons during Parent 
Engagement time.  

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
 

In September, during the first staff conference, the principal asks for teachers to choose baseline and benchmark 
assessments that will be used grade-wide to gather student data and to support teachers in driving appropriate 
instruction. On the first Tuesday of September, during teacher engagement time, teachers meet as a grade to discuss 
grade-wide benchmark assessments for ELA and Math, end of unit assessments for ELA and Math, and progress 
reports. A grade representative discusses the final chosen selections for assessments for their grade with the 
principal. The principal shares the selected assessments with the instructional cabinet. P.S. 11 uses the instructional 
cabinet as a resource to create surveys for teachers explaining their areas of expertise and areas for which they would 
benefit from receiving professional development. These surveys include, but are not limited to:  

Implementation of grade-wide assessments 

 
  Best teaching practices in Math and ELA 
  Behavior modifications 
  Addressing student accommodations during instruction 

The instructional cabinet also provides professional development to P.S. 11 staff and attains teachers within our staff 
to provide professional development within their area of expertise. Specifically, during the 2018 -2019 school year, we 
will incorporate any learned practices made by the Instructional Leader teachers.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another

purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 11, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

P.S. 11 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46

sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

 The Title III PS 11Queens after school program will provide direct instruction for current and 
former English Language Learners.  Parents will be notified in both English and in their home 
language of the opportunity for after-school instruction.  Attendance rosters and folders will be 
provided for the teachers providing instruction.  It is their responsibility to maintain attendance 
records.  Attendance records will be collected monthly by administration.  
 
Students will be grouped by both grade level and English proficiency levels. Newcomers may be 
placed in bridge classes focusing on oral language. Instruction for emerging, transitioning, 
expanding and commanding level students will be geared toward addressing the ELA and 
Mathematics Common Core Standards.  Instruction will be conducted in English with material 
separate from books and curriculum used during the instructional day.  
 
Fifty students in grades one and two will be placed in four small groups and receive services 
under Title III funds. To best address the English, Language Arts and Language needs of these 
students we will focus on the Speaking and Listening CCS as well as vocabulary acquisition and 
use in the CCS.  Students will build on their verbal vocabulary by participating in conversations, 
asking questions and responding to their peers and teachers during read alouds.  Students will 
express their thoughts and ideas through pictures, words sentences and role playing.  Our fifty 
first and second grade students will receive direct mathematical instruction to develop strategies 
and fluency in the areas of addition and subtraction.  
 
Seventy students in grades three, four, five and six will receive services under Title III 
funds.   To best address the English, Language Arts and Language needs of these students 
instruction will focus on the writing and language CCS.  After analyzing school data we notice 
our ENL’s lack adequate writing skills and basic knowledge of the conventions of the English 
language.  For these reasons students will receive direct instruction in producing a variety of 
clear and coherent pieces of writing.  Additionally, students will receive direct grammar 
instruction and demonstrate a command of standard grammar rules. 
Our third and fourth grade students will receive direct mathematical instruction to develop 
strategies and fluency for multiplying and dividing whole numbers, modeling fractions, and 
adding and subtracting fractions.  The instructional mathematical focus for our fifth and sixth 
grade students receiving services under Title III funding will to be to develop strategies and 
fluency when multiplying and dividing fractions and to write, interpret and use expressions and 
equations properly.  
All English Language Learners will receive direct instruction to help each student develop and 
build a strong mathematical vocabulary.  Mathematical vocabulary words will be used daily and 
examples of where and when to apply such words will be stressed.  All English Language 
Learners will use strategies and mathematical language to deconstruct word problems and solve 
them efficiently.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
The proposed submission is designed to service students that are at the various levels of acquired 
language: emerging, transitioning, expanding or commanding students.  Students will be grouped 
by grade-level as well as by proficiency level. 
 After-School instruction is scheduled to begin on January 16, 2019 and end on May 2, 2019 on 
Wednesday and Thursday afternoons from 2:30pm-4:30pm.     All teachers hold an ESL, 
Bilingual, or Common Branch license.  All common branch teachers will be teamed up with a 
licensed ESL or Bilingual teacher. The ENL teachers will plan with the content area teachers and 
instruction will be shared 50/50. 
The materials that will be used solely for after school ENL direct instruction are: 
•             Houghton Mifflin Harcourt----On Our Way To English 
•             People’s Publishing Group---Measuring Up 
•             NYS Coach Empire Edition books

PS 11 Queens will develop a professional learning plan for the Title III program.   PS 11 Q staff 
members that have specific expertise in ENL instruction will plan with content area teachers to 
best meet the needs of the students they  will be serving.   These staff members will share best 
teaching practices how best to positively impact student learning.  Professional learning and 
planning will take place January 9-10 and on March 7, 2019 each session will last two 
hours.  The first session will be spent analyzing student work to design instruction.   During the 
second session content area specialists and ENL teachers will collaborate to plan lessons that will 
best meet needs of the students attending the program.   On March 7th teachers will assess their 
students' progress and work with ENL and content specialist to modify instruction to meet 
students' needs. 
 
The rationale of the professional learning program is for teachers to increase English Language 
Learners’ literacy and math skills.   The professional learning plan will train teachers how to best 
instruct ENLs in the areas of speaking, writing and correct grammar.  Additionally, teachers will 
receive training on how to engage the ENL population in a meaningful and vocabulary rich 
setting.  Professional development will address the ENLs math needs by providing a variety of 
math strategies and activities that incorporate math manipulatives.  Teachers will also learn how 
to better engage ENLs in using a math rich vocabulary through discussion to meet the Math 
CCS. 
 
Additionally, teachers will be trained on how to use Imagine Learning,   an online program 
specifically designed for English Language Learners.      
 
Content Specialists and ENL Specialists that will provide professional learning are:

In order to best address the needs of PS 11’s ENL population English classes will be offered to 
the parents of our current and former English Language Learners.  Invitations will be sent home 
to parents in English, Spanish and Bengali.  The focus of the English classes will be to help 
parents better understand the English language and become more familiar with the Common 
Core Standards.   Email notification as well as fliers written in English, Spanish and Bengali will 
advertise the availability of the classes.  
There will be two parent sessions offered.  The sessions will be conducted on 
Tuesday afternoons .  The first of three consecutive Tuesday afternoons beginning on January 
22, 2019 and ending on February 5th, the second beginning on March 19, 2019 and ending April 
2, 2019.   
Parents’ will be asked to return an RSVP if they plan on attending the offered classes.  Workshop 
agendas and attendance sheets will be submitted to administration.  Parent workshops will be 
conducted by our Parent Coordinator, Math and Literacy Coaches,  bilingual 
paraprofessionals will be present to assist parents and workshop facilitators. .    
A needs assessment will be conducted during the classes to help us assess if we are addressing 
parents’ concerns.  It is our belief that when parents are true partners students excel.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
P.S. 11 uses many tools to assess the early literacy skills of our ELL population.  Some examples of assessments our teachers 
use are, the Fountas and Pinnell Reading Assessment System, Trophies Reading Program, and Fundations.  Fountas & Pinnell 
helps to provide teachers with information for student phonemic awareness, decoding and encoding skills, reading 
fluency  and reading comprehension.  The Trophies Reading Program has various assessments teachers use to assess student 
comprehension and growth in reading skills.  After every reading unit, teachers adinister a reading comprehension 
assessment.  Finally, the Fundations Program is used to assess the growth of student mastery in decoding and encoding 
skills.  Fundations is also used to for students to understand the rules of the English language.  All of these programs are 
combined to meet the needs of our ELL students during ELA instruction.  We implement oral language skills in our instructional 
plans.  We also create a high instructional focus on Word Study using the Fundations Program in the primary grades and

reading comprehension in all grades. 
 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

We have ENL support staff to provide Push-In and/or Pull-Out services.  ENL support staff provide PLCs to discuss best teaching 
practices to support ENL student achievement.   
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
P.S. 11 uses the expertise of our ENL department to ensure programs are used as resources to meet the needs of our 
students.  Also, the school instructional cabinet collaborates with the ENL department to ensure programs and resources can 
be altered so our ELL population receives quality instruction.  We ensure our ENL students make progress through frequent 
informal and formal assessments created by teachers and/or provided by programs.  P.S. 11 administration, the school 
instructional cabinet, and the ENL teachers utilize and disect the results of the May 2017 administered NYSESLAT to assess 
student achievement and progress made in our ELL population's English language comprehension.  Using the NYSESLAT we 
determine best teaching practices and instructional foci to support our ELL population make AYP on standardized exams.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

P.S. 11's ENL department schedules ENL Push-In/ Pull-Out programs based on ENL student needs per grade and any supports 
needed based on teacher certification and licensing area(s). 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
P.S. 11 implements the RTI framework for our ENL population.  Classroom teachers use data, both informal and formal, to 
assess student strengths and needs in areas of student improvement.  Using teacher data, classroom teachers support 
students in mastering the skills they may show deficiency.  First, teachers of ENL students consider how many ELLs are 
struggling in their classroom.  Teachers identify whether a preponderance of ENL students with similar linguistic backgrounds 
are struggling with a concept or are there one or two students struggling with a concept?  If there are few ENL students 
struggling with a concept, ESL teachers will differentiate instruction and provide Response to Intervention strategies (lessons) 
to address the needs of these few students.  The RTI lessons are implemented during the school day and within the child's 
classroom.  The assessments for RTI students may be resources found within the programs and curriculum used for whole 
class instruction and/or teachers may create original tasks geared towards specific concepts ENL students with RTI need.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
 
The data from the 2015 - 2016 school year's NYSESLAT and the NYSITELL administered during the 2016 - 2017 school year 
provides data and information that helps us to create our ENL programs.  Below please find the data: 
Kindergarten: 50 ENL students- 34% EX; 26% TR; 26% EM; 14% EN 
First Grade: 42 ENL students- 86% EX; 12% TR; 2%EN 
Second Grade: 68 ENL students- 37% EX; 31% TR; 26%EM; 6% EN 
Third Grade: 43 ENL students- 49% EX; 26% TR; 6% EM; 18% EN 
Fourth Grade: 38 ENL students- 47% EX; 42% TR; 11% EM 
Fifth Grade: 31 ENL students- 45% EX; 23% TR; 19% EM; 13% EN 
Sixth Grade: 31 ENL students- 68% EX; 19% TR; 13% EN 
The patterns we see in our data shows the grade with the highest percentage of expanding ELLs is in First Grade.  We have 
supported our first grade ELLs by providing Push-In support and some students that are non-ELLs to encourage model 
language skills in the First Grade class.  
Another pattern we see is in Grades 3, 4, 5, and 6 has at minimum 45% of of "Expanding" ELLs.  In these grades students are 
mixed with "Commanding" ELLs and students that were never ENL learners.  We look forward to see how ENL students can be 
motivated by their peers in learning the academic and higher vocabulary that is presented to all students in the class.  Also, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

 

teachers in these grades have used the same content area vocabulary for all students in the class: ENL, commanding and 
monolingual (English only) learners.  
Finally, in Kindergarten, the pattern we see is the scores are evenly distributed.  Kindergarten teachers use oral language skills 
to help our young ENL population listen, speak, read, and write in English.  Students are fully immersed in the English 
language.  Students in the Transitional Bilingual Education classes have the instruction in the target language change from 70% 
of the school day to 30% of instruction in the target language.  Throughout the school year, some students in class may receive 
an increase of instruction in the English language sooner than their peers based on their English communication and academic 
responses in English during instruction.   
Overall, based on the data, P.S. 11 has begun to incorporate grade appropriate and content rich vocabulary in all ENL 
classes.  ENL students are exposed to the same literature and literacy skills as their English speaking peers.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

In September, the assistant principal and principal review the NYSESLAT scores and gives all scores to the ENL Department and 
classroom teachers.  These scores helps to drive instruction based on individual student needs within a classroom and our 
whole group ENL population.   

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

In P.S.11, we provide ENL services in the Integrated ENL program by providing students with a dual licensed Common 
Branch and ESL teacher.  In this ENL program, teachers are trained and certified to teach the common core learning 
standards and utilize the curriculum and school programs to meet the needs and challenges of their ESL students.  All 
subjects in a Freestanding ENL class weave the concepts of ESL instruction.  Teachers frequently use student prior 
knowledge to build upon new concepts; use visual learning frequently; define language and vocabulary prior to 
lessons; frequently use technology to assist in lesson instruction and build upon visual learning; and integrate 
cooperative learning.  Students are grouped in this program based on parent surveys.  Within the Freestanding ENL 
program, stand-alone ENL instruction is embedded to develop English language skills so that students can succeed in 
core content courses, such as, Social Studies, Math and Science. It is delivered by a certified ENL teacher. Within the 
Freestanding ENL program, Integrated ENL instruction is embedded to build English language skills through content 
area instruction, such as, math and science.  It is delivered by a dual certified teacher (ENL and common branch) or 
co- teaching by a certified ENL teacher and a certified content area teacher.  We support the mandate of former ELLs 
up to 2 years after exiting ELL status receive 90 minutes or more of stand alone or integrated ENL.    In the 
Freestanding ENL program, Common Core aligned instruction is provided for Math instruction, English and Language 
Arts instruction, Science, and Social Studies.  These subject areas are taught with an ESL licensed and Common Branch 
licensed teacher.  These subject areas are taught using ENL teaching strategies.      

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

In P.S.11, we offer ENL services in the Transitional Bilingual Education program to students in grades K through 2 
whose Home Language Survey indicates they are language dominant in Spanish and if parents choose to enroll their 
child in the TBE program.  Students are grouped in this program based on parent surveys.  In this program, students 
are provided ENL services with a dual licensed Common Branch and Bilingual teacher.  In this ENL program, teachers 
are trained and certified to teach the common core learning standards and utilize the curriculum and school programs 
to meet the needs and challenges of their students.  All subjects in a Transitional Bilingual Education class weave the 
concepts of ENL instruction and use the Spanish language for translation and instructional purposes.  The percentage 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

 

of daily instruction in Spanish varies based on the student needs.  In the beginning of the school year, daily instruction 
in Spanish may be 70% of the school day.  Whereas in April, daily instruction in Spanish may be 30%.  Teachers 
frequently use student prior knowledge to build upon new concepts; use visual learning frequently; define language 
and vocabulary prior to lessons; frequently use technology to assist in lesson instruction and build upon visual 
learning; and integrate cooperative learning.  In the TBE program, Common Core aligned instruction is provided for 
Math instruction, English and Language Arts instruction, Science, and Social Studies.  These subject areas are taught 
using ENL teaching strategies.      

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Not Applicable 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

 P.S. 11 ensures the mandated number of instructional minutes delivered is based on student scores on NYSESLAT or 
NYSITELL.  Data is gathered through ATS assessment score reports.  During professional development, the following 
information is given to ESL and classroom teachers to ensure mandated minutes of ENL instruction are given to each individual 
student.  Students rated "entering" receive at least 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week.  Students rated "emerging" 
receive at least 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week.  Students rated "transitioning" receive at least 180 minutes of ENL 
instruction per week.  Students rated "expanding" receive at least 180 minutes of ENL instruction per week.  Our goal is, 
students rated "commanding" receive at least 90 minutes of ENL instruction per week.  The mandated ENL instruction is 
embedded in all content areas including, ELA, Math, Science, and Social Studies.        
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Teachers frequently use student prior knowledge to build upon new concepts; use visual learning frequently; define language 
and vocabulary prior to lessons; frequently use technology to assist in lesson instruction and build upon visual learning; and 
integrate cooperative learning.  In the TBE program, Spanish is used to accommodate student understanding in the native 
language.  ENL and TBE teachers use these teaching strategies to accommodate ENL learning using the following programs and 
materials: Go Math!, StoryTown, Trophies, Harcourt Science and Social Studies, Social Studies Weekly and teacher created 
Writing Units of Study.  All of these programs are accommodated to be Common Core aligned and meet the needs of ENL 
learners by using ENL teaching strategies mentioned.  Go Math! has a Spanish component where the terms and letters home 
are translated.  All of these programs and curriculums are used in the Freestanding ENL and Transitional Bilingual Education 
programs.  P.S. 11 also has subscriptions to websites, such as, www.RAZ-Kids.com. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

The math programs, Go Math! and Envisions, have benchmark assessments after each unit of study in Spanish and those 
assessments are used on an "as needed" basis.  For newly admitted students, TBE teachers assess literacy skills in Spanish 
using pieces of Spanish literature to assess reading comprehension and reading fluency.  As the year progresses, the literacy 
measurements that are used are the Fountas and Pinnell Reading Assessment System, and chapter and unit assessments from 
StoryTown and Trophies.  These assessments are in English.  These assessments are translated based on the child's 
comprehension of literacy in the English language.   The school's testing coordinator requests exams translated in the child's 
home language.  The school's ENL department requests Bilingual glossaries for students to use during instruction and as a form 
of references when communicating in the English Language.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 

Long Term 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

e. 

Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

P.S. 11 teachers often combine classes for instruction.  During these hours of instruction ELL students, Former ELL students, 
the general education population, and students whom are working above standards come together in cooperative learning 
groups and discuss and complete school work.  During these times of cooperative learning all students are challenged to meet 
their individual academic expectations, make connections to prior knowledge and build upon prior knowledge, and make 
social growth with their peers.  a.  P.S. 11 differentiates instruction for SIFE students by teachers administering benchmark 
assessments for these students to assess and create lessons that will scaffold and meet the needs of these students.  There is 
also a strong socio-emotional component given in the classroom environment for SIFE students to mature in their academic 
studies.  Once a SIFE student is performing at or above the transitioning/intermediate level on the annual English language 
proficiency assessment, the student’s status as a Student with Inconsistent/Interrupted Formal Education is removed, even 
though the student may continue to be identified as an English language learner. b.  P.S. 11 differentiates instruction for 
Newcomer students by providing these students with a learning environment where teachers use a majority of visual learning 
aides to enhance student learning.  In this environment the newcomer students spend a majority of their school day listening 
and speaking in the English language.  When possible, translation and/or instruction in the home language is given by a 
teacher or bilingual paraprofessional.  On all assessments, both State and local, these students receive time and a half to 
complete the assessments.        c.  P.S. 11 differentiates instruction for Developing students by providing these students with 
an environment where teachers create lessons that incorporate visual learning aides, hands-on activities, and vocabulary rich 
units of study that encompass ELA and more than one content area.  ENL students receive time and a half to complete 
assessments, when there are timed exams. d.  P.S. 11 differentiates instruction for Long Term students by providing these 
students with an environment where teachers create lessons that incorporate visual learning aides, hands-on activities, and 
vocabulary rich units of study that encompass ELA and more than one content area.  On all assessments, both State and local, 
these students receive time and a half to complete the assessments. e.  P.S. 11 differentiates instruction for Former ELL 
students by placing these students in classroom where there is a preponderance of English proficient students.  In these 
classes, former ELLs are surrounded by students and teachers whom frequently use high academic vocabulary.  These students 
receive at least 90 minutes of ENL instruction per week.  On all assessments, both State and local, these students receive time 
and a half to complete all assessments.      
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 In P.S.11, we provide ESL services by providing students with a licensed Special Education teacher and support staff that is a 
licensed ESL teacher.  These students incorporate the Integrated model.  In our ENL programs, teachers are trained and 
certified to teach the common core learning standards and utilize the curriculum and school programs to meet the needs and 
challenges of their students.  All subjects in our ENL classes weave the concepts of ESL instruction.  Some strategies teachers 
frequently use student prior knowledge to build upon new concepts; use visual learning frequently; define language and 
vocabulary prior to lessons; frequently use technology to assist in lesson instruction and build upon visual learning; and 
integrate cooperative learning.  Specifically, for our ELL Students with Disabilities, the IEP team determines the individual ELL's 
special education services and instruction delivery.  These students receive accommodations based on the mandated IEP 
requirements and ELL requirements.  The accommodations may be given during classroom or State testing, may be given 
during instruction, and are always tailored to the ELL student's individual needs.In order to accelerate English language 
acquisition, teachers use these materials to focus on the fundamentals of vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and reading 
comprehension in order to push students towards effective language use, and ultimately, fluency.  Repetition of content area 
topics are done.        
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
P.S. 11 ensures our ELL Students with Disabilities attain English proficiency while addressing the mandated IEP goals by having 
highly qualified pedagogues create instruction that accommodates the student's learning style to the standards.  Highly 
qualified pedagogues may include, but are not limited to, the classroom teacher, the ENL teacher, the SETTS teacher or special 
education teacher, the School Psychologist and the IEP team.  All members servicing the child keep data and low inference 
notes that describe student strengths and possible future goals in ENL and Special Education.  Push-In and Pull-Out 
instructional services are provided by ESL and Special Education pedagogues.  Such members include, A. Kelly, S. Kladias , P. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

Mauclair, A. Trilivas, H. Tsai, A. Hetherington, D. Haas, C. Madej, M. McDonald, A. Porcasi, M. Rodziewicz, and M. 
Yapjoco.  Placement of ENL students in ICT or Self Contained Special Education classess is dependent on the recommended and 
approved services established by the school psychologist (G. Grammatikopoulos), a special education teacher (P. Falcetta), 
assistant principal (E. Grabicki), SETSS provider (A. Hetherington), speech therapist (D. Haas, C. Madej, M. McDonald, or A. 
Porcasi), social worker (J. Maimone), and the parent of the ENL child.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Intervention programs for ELLs in ELA and Math include but are not limited to: iReady, Go Math, Imagine Learning, Fundations, 
and Wilson.  Within all of the programs, instruction is differentiated and tailored to meet the needs and challenges of our ELL 
population.  Teachers practice the RTI model to ensure lessons and instruction is differentiated.  Interventions for Science and 
Social Studies programs are teacher created.  ENL teachers make revisions to the lessons and units within the Harcort 
programs to best meet the needs of our ENL students.  ENL teachers accommodate the instruction to best serve their ENL 
population.  Within the TBE program, translation of the content areas (Math, Science and Social Studies) is provided by the TBE 
teacher.  P.S. 11 has language paras in few classes.  These paraprofessionals provide translation in content area 
instruction.  The languages these paraprofessionals speak are either Bengali or Spanish.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

As mentioned, P.S. 11 will implement a new math resource to address the math curriculum and standards.  Go Math has an 
ENL component that will help our ENL teachers create instruction that meets the needs of our ENL students.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

All services and programs will continue and remain.   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ENL classes use the same resources as the general education population.  These programs are: Go Math!, Envisions, 
StoryTown and Trophies.  ENL teachers tailor the programs using their pedagogical expertise to address the needs of the ENL 
population.  Title III funds help to create after - school ENL programs that are offered to all students entitled to ENL services 
during the school day and offered to former ELL students to help with their transition of ELL identification.  Also, based on New 
York State test scores and/or teacher recommendations after-school programs are offered to our ELL and Former ELL 
populations for Academic Intervention purposes or Academic Enrichment purposes.  P.S. 11 also offers Saturday Science 
Workshops, Chorus, and Drama Club.  Students are invited by receiving a parent notice.  Parents sign and return giving their 
child permission to remain for the after school programs.  ELLs fully participate by remaining during after school hours.  ELLs 
are represented through their own participation. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
To support our ELL population teachers uses hands-on materials, visual aides, technology, and the incorporation of 
cooperative learning.  Teachers frequently use student prior knowledge to build upon new concepts; use visual learning 
frequently; define language and vocabulary prior to lessons; frequently use technology to assist in lesson instruction and build 
upon visual learning; and integrate cooperative learning.  These strategies are used in ELA and all content areas.  Frequently, 
our teachers create thematic units of study to incorporate one or more content areas with ELA.  Some examples of materials 
used are iPads, Base-ten blocks, SmartBoards, Promethian Boards, laptops and Fraction Tiles.  Students in the TBE class have 
access to a Spanish library in their classroom.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home Language support is given through frequent parent workshops given by our Parent Coordinator, Linda Schuler.  During 
these workshops, translators are available.  Notices sent from the school to parents are given in the child's home language, 
when available.  Teachers in a Freestanding ENL class request and receive translators during Parent Teacher Conferences and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

 

any parent meetings.  In the Transitional Bilingual classes, teachers provide translations and literary accommodations in the 
native language received in the Bilingual class.  Paraprofessionals whom are fluent in Bengali provide translations in texts we 
send home and provide translation in workshops provided.  Using the Imagine Learning Program and incorporating Bilingual 
glossaries, home language is supported and assessed with the classroom.  Also, in the TBE prgram, there are instructional 
materials that are available in the Target Instructional Language.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

P.S. 11 ensures all mandated services and resources support and correspond to an ELL's grade and age level by utilizing highly 
qualified ENL teachers and classroom teachers to create lessons and units of study that are appropriate to the standards and 
meet the needs and challenges of the ENL student. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Last year, P.S. 11 created a welcoming school environment by having frequent parent orientations, parent workshops, and 
parent meetings during the mandated dates set forth by Chancellor Carmen Fariña in September, November, March, and 
May.  We also began hosting parent workshops and parent meetings tailored to content areas and grade level frequently 
throughout the year on Tuesday afternoons and during the evenings.  During these parent workshops and meetings, 
translations were made available to parents.  All classroom teachers, administration, paraprofessionals and school based 
support team members were involved.  New incoming students receive one-to-one attention from guidance counselors and 
administration to help them ease into their new environment.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

NONE 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The ELL personnel in P.S. 11 includes: Sixth Grade Teacher, M. Radoncic; Fifth Grade Teacher, Edith Cruz; Fourth Grade 
Teacher, Laura Olivares; Second Grade Teacher, M. Escalante; First Grade Teacher, S. Llakmani; First Grade Teacher, A. Ramos, 
and Kindergarten Teacher, S. Rodriguez.  ENL instruction as a "push-in" or "pull - out"  service is provided by, A. Kelly, 
S. Kladias, P/ Mauclair, A. Trilivas and H. Tsai.  The above teachers meet frequently to discuss best teaching practices in the ENL 
classroom and utilizing resources to meet the needs of their students.  Teachers create their own schedules to meet on

on Monday afternoons.  Using the expertise of ENL teachers, classroom teachers, the Math and Literacy Coach, and 
administration data is collected to analyze student strengths and promote student academic growth.  Materials, resources, 
Common Core learning standards, and best practices are discussed to ensure our ELL population is receiving high quality 
education 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
As mentioned, P.S. 11 provides professional development is given to teachers of ELLS on Monday afternoons.  Teachers are 
provided professional development in ENL education mandates and effective teaching strategies on at least two Mondays a 
month.  Using the expertise of ENL teachers, classroom teachers, the Math and Literacy Coach, and administration data is 
collected to analyze student strengths and promote student academic growth.  Materials, resources, Common Core learning 
standards, and best practices are discussed to ensure our ELL population is receiving high quality education.  Resources, recent 
published research, and any district and/or NYCDOE ELL seminars attended are discussed and "turn-keyed."  Agendas and 
attendance sheets are kept on file in the Principal's office.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
For the 2017-2018 school year, teachers plan on using the "Parent Engagement Time" on Tuesday afternoons to provide 
individual, one to one conferences with parents of our ELL population.  

 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

P.S. 11 has a Parent Coordinator, Linda Schuler, that fosters parental involvement by creating parent workshops on how 
parents of our ELL population can support student growth.  Also, our PTA president, Mindy Greene frequently extends 
invitations to the school workshops and school activities to encourage parental involvement.  Teachers frequently have 
academic celebrations during the school day in which ELL parents are invited to see academic accomplishments.  Teachers also 
provide workshops in their classrooms so they may show academic expectations for the students at different points of the 
school year.  During the 2016-2017 school year, P.S. 11 hosted Science Workshops, Math and ELA workshops, New York State 
testing workshops, Parent Career Day, Cultural Day/ Family Night, and Parent Read-Aloud Day.  We plan to continue and 
expand on these activities for the 2017-2018 school year.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Elizabeth Pena Jorge, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).

  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Home Langauge Surveys are closely reviewed at the time of registation. Our pupil accounting secretary enters the 
data on ATS that found on the back of the HLS. We look closely at the RAPL (Adult Preferred Langauge Report) 
generated on ATS to ensure data is correct. Also, as an immediate search the Emergency Blue Contact has the 
information.Teachers also send out surveys regarding their preferred langauge for communication.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language
