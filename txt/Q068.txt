Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          6 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 
PS 68 Cambridge School Mission Statement: We believe that all children including English Language Learners, Special 
Education students and high achievers, can learn. We will work with parents and the community to achieve the highest 
academic standards. Our computer lab, literacy partners, Internet access, library and art partners are assets in helping 
students reach their goals. Our students will be well-informed, lifelong learners who reach their fullest potential. 
Everyone at PS 68 has a vision of excellence.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 

 
 
 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

PS 68 Cambridge School is an Elementary School with 631 students from pre-kindergarten to 5th grade. The 
population is comprised of 3% Asian, 2% Black, 86% Hispanic, 8% White, and 1% Hawaiian/ Pacific Islander or Multi-
racial. The student body includes 17% English Language Learners and 18.5% Students with Disabilities. Currently, our 
students are 52% male and 48% female. The average attendance rate for the 2017-2018 school year was 92.8%. 
 
Our school’s Instructional Focus for 2017-2018 was "in an effort to strengthen school-wide coherence and further 
student progress, teachers and students will focus on revision in order to improve and support teacher practice and 
student learning. Revision will be seen on curriculum maps, lesson plans, personal goals, student goals, and student 
work samples across all grades and subjects." Teachers were given professional development on looking at student 
data in order to make changes to their lessons and on small group instruction in literacy and math in order to make 
revisions on curriculum maps to support differentiation needed to address all learners. Common preps were 
scheduled to allow for grade level teacher teams to meet regularly to plan and make revisions to curriculum maps. 
Revision work will continue although the instructional focus shifts.  
 
Upon reflecting on this year, we see improvements in reading and writing levels and we know that there is more work 
to be done but progress in math is stalling. This is why our instructional focus for the 2018-2019 school year will 
center on math. Our tentative instructional focus for 2018-19 is: Students will deepen their critical thinking in 
mathematics by demonstrating a balance between skills taught and evidence of conceptual understanding in order to 
achieve higher levels of proficiency in math.  
 
Partnerships for 2017-2018 included:  

Studio in a School for Grades K-5 
Shubert Theater Grant with Arts Connection partnership 

 
 
  Breakdancing with Casey Beauchamp for Grades 1-4 
  CASA Grant with a partnership with the Queens Botanical Garden 
 

Service in Schools - Cambridge Caring Club which continued and built upon a grant for a sustainable garden in 
an urban setting awarded by the LOWES Charitable and Educational Foundation and Grow to Learn grant 

We hope to continue with these partnerships in 2018-2019.  
In order to reach every type of learner and think about the whole child, below are some special initiatives that are in 
place.  

  We will continue an Enrichment Program for 2018-2019 school year. This program begins with teachers 

choosing areas of interest which they could facilitate (i.e. dancing, painting, puzzles, legos, songwriting, etc) 
then students choosing their top areas of interest. Students were grouped in grade bands K-1/ 2-3/ 4-5 and 
participated in 3 cycles of enrichment which was conducted every other week. Enrichment days were 
scheduled on days with lower attendance rates to motivate students. Enrichment will be continuing next year. 
Student attendance is monitored very closely and celebrated when classes reach 100% attendance. Be-Here-
Be-a-Winner is called each day to promote perfect attendance.  

 

  To build self-esteem and independence, we have a student volunteers/ Community Service Program. This 

program includes classroom helpers. We have also incorporated classroom incentives in the lunchroom such 
as earning emojis for positive whole class behavior. Because of these initiatives we have noticed a decrease in 
lunchroom incidents in OORS. During school assemblies we celebrate our top earners from our Positive 
Behavior Intervention System (PBIS) Program. Parents get to celebrate alongside their child.  

  We are providing an eco-friendly school environment by making our students aware of their environment by 

recycling during breakfast and lunch daily. Our Recycling Committee, comprised of students, collects 
recyclables weekly as well as assisting with composting during lunch periods. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

  We are continuing use of Lexia which was introduced to us two years ago as part of a grant for ENL students 

and has shown to help students achieve 4-20 additional literacy skills during use across the year.  

  Every Friday classes perform unique presentations to extend their learning. During monthly PTA meetings  
  Every month “students of the month” are celebrated.  
  As a literacy-based school, we encourage students to read during the summer by celebrating our summer 

readers at our first PTA meeting in the fall. This year we expanded our summer "challenge" to include not only 
reading projects, but use of MyOn, Lexia and IXL.  

Based on an in-depth analysis of the 2018 School Quality Guide, trust received our highest score with 3.84. Trust is 
built into all our school goals. The 2017-2018 PPO feedback and Quality Review indicators celebrates an alignment of 
curriculum across classrooms which is evident of higher order thinking, student choice and planning with use of data. 
An area of focus is in regards to teacher teams and leadership. We will continue the work started towards the end of 
last year of creating a group of teacher leaders who are beginning to work on re-structuring team meetings to 
increase efficiency and build more capacity across our school.  

We track our students in ELA and math using running records and benchmarks and analyze state exam scores. This is 
what the data showed in June 2018:  

  According to Teacher’s College Running Records, school-wide data shows 53.47% of students met benchmark 

which means they are reading on or above grade level. This is an increase from 48.24% of students meeting 
benchmark in June 2017 and 42% in June 2016. We are continuing to make progress in reading.  

  According to our in-house ELA benchmark for grades 2-5 adapted from CCLS, schoolwide data shows 16% of 
students meeting benchmark (level 3 or 4). 64% of students scored at a level 1 on our ELA benchmark exam.  
  According to our in-house Math Benchmark from GoMath, schoolwide data shows 39% of students meeting 
their grade-level benchmark. Students in K-2 average 57% meeting benchmark by scoring a level 3 or 4 and 
students in grades 3-5 average 23% of students meeting this benchmark.  
In 2017, 37.4% of students scored a level 3 or 4 on the NYS ELA. For the 2018 NYS ELA exams, 90% of students 
met the promotional cut scores set by the Department of Education.  
In 2017, 34.2% of students scored a level 3 or 4 on the NYS Math exam. For the 2018 NYS math exams, 91% of 
students met the promotional cut scores set by the Department of Education.

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

ENL subgroup: 

  AYP indicates 
  According to the breakdown in modalities for the NYSESLAT 2016 exam, 96% of ENL students score the lowest 

in writing with many students scoring significantly lower than they did in the other modalities.

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

We celebrate our strength in Collaborative Teachers and Trust. Teachers are committed to the success of their 
students. Grade level and cross grade teams meet to plan and look at student work. This year we are looking to 
increase the efficiency of the teams and build more capacity. Teachers volunteered to become teacher leaders 
towards the end of 2018 to begin working on this endeavor.  

According to the 2018 School Quality Report, Supportive Environment was the weak area for the school. Teachers and 
students are made to feel safe in the school. According to OORS, incidences have decreased during the past school 
year. However, school survey results felt that only approximately 75% of students listened carefully when given 
directions and behaved when they teacher was watching. Unfortunately we rate poorly in the component of moving 
students with special needs to less restrictive environments. This past year we were able to move 2 students to a less 
restrictive environment and will focus on improving that in the future.  

Another key area of focus, according to the Framework for Great Schools within Rigorous Instruction is the 
assessment of what students are learning where we rated fair. This year we have tried to streamline the way we 
assess students, worked on scheduling time for data analysis and further utilize SchoolNet as a tool for gathering and 
using data from assessments more efficiently and will continue to do so next year.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
In terms of instruction, PS 68 shows the following strengths:  

  The June 2018 teacher evaluations based on Danielson Framework for Teaching shows 100% of teachers rate 

effective or highly effective in domains 1 and 2. In domain 3, school level MOTP showed 98% of teachers 
rated effective or highly effective in 3B (Questioning and Discussion) and 3c (Engaging Students in Learning); 
this was a 7% increase from June 2017.  

  Reading on-grade level broke 50% with 53.47% students reading on or above grade level in June 2018. 

Reading progress continues to increase across the year.  

  Narrative Writing for ENLs increased from only 1% of students in K-5 scoring a level 3 or 4 in September 2017 
to 17% in June 2018. In September 2017, 65% of ENL students scored a level 1 and by June 2018 only 31% of 
ENL students scored a level 1.  

  Pre-liminary cut scores for 2018 NYS ELA and math exams show 90% of students meeting promotional 

criteria.  

This year the priority need is in math.  

  GoMath pre-requisite math inventory which assessed the previous grade level standards given in September 

2017 showed only 21% of students schoolwide entering with proficiency in the previous year's math 
standards. 

  The GoMath end of year school benchmark given in June 2018 showed 39% of students in kindergarten 

through grade 5 showing proficiency by achieving a level 3 or 4 on grade level standards.  

  NYS ELA & Math cut scores for June 2018 showed 89% of third graders, 90% of fourth graders and 92% of fifth 

graders meeting promotional criteria. However, historically when the actual math scores come in the 
percentage drops significantly. In June 2017, the cut scores for NYS Math in third grade showed 87% meeting 
promotional criteria but 38% ended up scoring proficient; in fourth grade, 90% had met promotional criteria 
and 32% ended up scoring proficient.  

  According to the teacher observations using the Danielson Framework, the area of need is 3d (Using 

Assessment in Instruction). In 3d, 29% of teachers rated developing in June 2018.  

  According to the Quality Review 2016-2017 an area of celebration includes having a culture of mutual trust 
and positive attitudes that support the academic and personal growth of the students and teachers. An area 
of focus is ensuring engaging, rigorous and coherent curricula in all subjects, accessible for a variety of 
learners and aligned to standards. This shows that although students feel safe and happy in class but more 
needs to be done to reach all the diverse learners in our classrooms.  

This data identifies identifies a need for math to be a school wide focus in order to ensure that students are 
developing the necessary critical thinking skills needed to meet common core standards in math.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
The safety and happiness of students is always a priority.  

  Attendance is 93%.  
  Overall incidences in OORS went down from 53 incidences in 2017 to 48 incidences in 2018.  
  According to OORS, incidences occurring in the cafeteria accounted for 17% of incidences in June 2018 down 

from 23% in June 2017.  

  We are a Respect for All school.  
  According to 2016-2017 Quality Review school culture is a well-developed area.  
  PBIS is working well and growing in the school with a school store for top earners and incentives in the 

cafeteria.  

In determining a priority need for this Framework element, data shows that 

 
 
 

In 2016-2017, 2 ICT students moved to general education and 1 to just related services. 
In 2017-2018, 2 students were de-certified from SETSS 
In 2017-2018, 3 students were mainstreamed for math instruction.  

Minimal data shows students moving into a less restrictive environment in order to support the whole child.   

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, in an effort to maximize inclusion in general education classes, SWDs will be scheduled in general

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

According to the NYC School survey results in 2016, effective school leadership is our area of strength.  

  The principal conveys a clear vision for the school and strong sense of school community.  
  The weakest component in this area is better coordination of instruction across grades. According to to 

quality review indicators and PPO visits, systems for the use of assessments and data in driving instruction 
across the school is an area of need.  
In June 2018, 53.47% of students in kindergarten through grade 5 were reading on or above grade level. This 
is over a 5% increase from June 2017 and a 13% increase from September 2017. This is highest percentage of 
on or above grade level readers that PS 68 has had in recent years.  
Subgroups showed lower reading level proficiency with 15% of ELLs and 26% of SWDs reading on or above 
grade level in June 2018.  
In 2017-2018, there was an increased use of Lexia, a research based, individualized online literacy program. 
Almost all students had at least partial usage. 11% of students were meeting usage.  
Students using Lexia gained proficiency in 4 - 20 skills across the year depending on their amount of usage

Data shows that reading is an area of need especially for ELLs and SWDs.  
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, in an effort to close the proficiency gap in reading of ENL and SWDs in grades K-5, school leaders will 
facilitate ENL and SWD teacher team meetings and provide targeted professional development around literacy 
resources as measured by a 5% increase in ENL and SWDs reading levels according to Teacher's College Reading and 
Writing Project running records.

  Collaborative projects among IS 77, PS 88, PS 239 and PS 68 were somewhat successful in joining schools and 

students together but on average only 20-30 families participated. Collaborative projects will continue in 
2018-2019. 

  Enrollment is on the decline. In October 2017, 650 students were enrolled and by June 2018, 630 students 

were enrolled.  

Data shows that an increase in parent involvement is necessary to support the whole child and their family and create 
a stronger tie among the school, family and community.  
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, PS 68 will partner with a NYC DOE mental health liaison to bring in organizations to provide workshops for 
children, teachers and parents, in an effort to promote the health, wellness and education of the whole child, as 
measured by an increase in parent presence at monthly events and/or meetings.

The use of assessments in school is decided by: 

  MOSL (Measures of Student Learning) Team, which is made up of 8 members representing different 

populations in our school, who meet to decide which assessments will be used for the teachers' ratings for 
measures of student learning which will become part of their final ratings.  

  Teachers create rubrics with their grade. 
  Teams such as CORE have grade representatives and discuss work from POP teacher teams and grade level 

teams around the schoolwide instructional focus and CEP goals then work to align it schoolwide and 
disseminate information.  

  Each grade has subject specific facilitators and create curriculum maps which includes assessment 
  A Professional Development committee plans professional development around teacher and schoolwide 

needs such as giving assessments and then analyzing and utilizing data gathered. 

  TC staff developers facilitate groups that spend time working with running records and writing rubrics.  
  Norming of assessments such as MOSL, running records and use of the writing progression is done by 

coaches, staff developers, MOSL team members and grade leaders.  

  Analyzing and utilizing data workshops are delivered by the literacy coach, math coach and data specialist.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student 
achievement. The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure 
effective involvement of parents and community in the school. Public School 68Q, in compliance with the 
Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and 
implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement 
between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively 
involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are 
encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent 
Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Public School 68Q will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement 
level, e.g., literacy, math and use of technology; 
● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning 
and decision making in support of the education of their children; 
● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support 
and monitor their child’s progress; 
● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, 
and in languages that parents can understand; 
● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to 
improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between 
parents and other members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent-Teacher Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on 
the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase 
and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the 
implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;

strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, 
the Parent-Teacher Association and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support and 
ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  
● Maintain a Parent Coordinator to serve as a liaison between the school and families. The Parent 
Coordinator will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the parents of children who 
attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and inviting to all 
parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each 
month and file a report with the central office.; 
● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  
● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 
● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise 
parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their 
right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 
1118 and other applicable sections under the ESSA; 
● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of 
the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  
● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations 
and workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”

Begin description here:            
P.S. 68's Title III program provides English Language Learners with supplemental instruction in 
an early bird program as well as an after-school program. Students' NYSESLAT, State Math, and 
State ELA scores for the past three years as well as portfolios, running records and teacher 
observations are used to determine the additional instruction necessary for these children.  The 
following factors are also considered: whether or not they were a potential hold over, a long term 
ELL, or a special education student.   The early bird/after-school program will service students in 
grades 2, 3, 4 and 5. 
Four teachers will teach the early bird/ after-school program.  All classes will be taught or 
serviced by a licensed ENL teachers.  Instruction will be in English with native language 
support.  The program will service approximately 70 students across grades 2, 3, 4 and 5.  These 
students are in our ELL subgroup and identified as low performing on the previous 1-3 
year's NYSESLAT, NYS ELA and NYS Math exams or by Teacher College running records, 
GoMath math exams, as well as teacher recommendation.  The early bird program will meet 3 
days per week (Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday) from 7:05 am to 8:05 am for approximately 
75 sessions during the months of October through April servicing students in grades 2 and 
3.    The after-school program will be held each week on Wednesday and Thursday from 2:30 
pm until 4:00 pm and will run through April for approximately 50 sessions servicing ENL 
students in fourth and fifth grade.  
The early bird/after-school program specifically addresses instruction to improve language 
development, writing and academic vocabulary.  The math component is inquiry based and 
focuses on problem solving, numeration, measurement, etc. and utilizes technology.  Instruction 
will be provided by licensed ENL teachers to help students meet the standards in math, reading 
and writing.  We will use a Balanced Literacy approach to reading and writing because it is a 
framework designed to help all students learn to read and write effectively.  The workshop model 
that we will use at PS 68 is a structure used to help students reach grade level status.  With this 
model, based on the research of Marie Clay, Irene Fountas, and Gay Su Pennell, children read 
and write each day independently and in group settings, both large and small. Our teachers will 
focus on four different types of reading experiences: read aloud, shared reading, guided reading, 
and Independent reading.  Children will also participate in Common Core aligned test taking 
strategy lessons using the Common Core Clinic books published by Triumph Learning as a 
supplemental resource. These materials will be used by all grades. During the school day, 
students will be actively involved in literacy learning through the Teachers College Reading and 
Writing Project, the before and after school materials from Triumph Learning will support the 
skills and strategies taught in the workshop model.  Teacher created centers will be used to 
provide differentiated reinforcement of skills practiced on a routine basis.   
Listening and speaking will also be emphasized in this integrated language approach. All 
experiences meet the Common Core Standards for Language Arts Instruction. Strategies will be

by "shades of meaning", language and content objectives and ENL scaffolds such as language 
frames and graphic organizers.  Students will be given opportunities to participate in classroom 
activities through all modalities - speaking, listening, reading and writing.  Supplementary non-
fiction instructional materials that focus on the areas of student need will be provided to augment 
this instruction.  In addition, math instruction will work on number operations and algebraic 
thinking, measurement, data and geometry, and numbers and operations. During the school day 
the students follow the GoMath program and the early bird and afterschool program will further 
support this instruction by using materials that will focus on each topic in isolation.  General 
instructional supplies such as markers and chart paper will be purchased to support the program.

Begin description here:            
P.S. 68's Title Ill Professional Development Program will focus on providing teachers with 
scaffolds and differentiated instructional strategies for teaching English Language 
Learners.   These strategies are essential for effective instruction for ELLs.  Teachers will learn a 
variety of ways to scaffold activities and different approaches for supporting the development of 
academic literacy.  There will be a focus on how to prepare ELLs to meet and exceed the NYC 
and NYS performance and learning standards and achieve higher scores on all state assessments. 
In addition, we will incorporate additional strategies addressing ELL students who also have 
special needs from resources such as Teacher's College and Fundations and the Wilson 
Program.  Teachers will participate in professional development workshops. 
Ongoing professional development will support teachers in supporting all levels of ELLs in their 
class with strategies to use to scaffold lessons. These professional development sessions will be 
facilitated by the school's Assistant  Principal, ENL teachers, as well as the literacy coach who is 
a licensed ENL teacher. Four teachers and one supervisor working in the supplementary 
instructional program will receive 3 additional sessions of professional development before 
school from 7 to 8 a.m. Teachers will receive professional development which includes academic 
language development, New Language Arts Progressions, deconstructing and reconstructing 
texts, language objectives and language structure and planning to support ENL standards for 
various levels of students. This professional development will cost 3 hours of per session pay for 
the 4 teachers, 1 AP and 1 facilitator.  Records of professional development will include a memo 
prior to the professional development of dates, topics and location; agendas during the meeting; 
and sign-in sheets for attendance.   
Topics that will be addressed during these professional development sessions are as follows:    
1.     One hour professional development sessions will be devoted to the strategies needed to 
prepare ELL students to work towards the New Language Arts Progression according to their 
language proficiency level and to gain a clear understanding of the NYSESLAT test. 
2.     One hour professional development sessions will be devoted to differentiated instructional 
strategies including small group instruction emphasizing comprehensibility, oral language 
development, academic vocabulary development and language objectives. 
3.     One hour professional development sessions will be devoted to mathematical Instructional 
strategies to develop and enhance students' skills and performance on the city and state

Begin description here:            
P.S. 68's Title III program will provide ELL parents/guardians with the opportunity to attend 
eight parent workshops across the year on various topics of family literacy and math so that they 
can better assist in the education and learning of their children at home.  A series of one hour 
workshops will be held to accommodate different schedules.  Parents will be surveyed to find out 
times that are agreeable to all.  Parents will be provided with translation services during each 
workshop and will receive notification of each workshop in their native language.  Refreshments 
will be served.  Although the parent coordinator will support the parent engagement, licensed 
ENL teachers will conduct the workshop and provide the parents with useful information. 
 
The first ELL parent workshop will be held on the last Tuesday of the month in October 2018 at 
2:30 p.m during parent engagement time.  There will be 8 parent workshops held once a month 
on the last Tuesday of the month at 2:30 pm which is parent engagement time.  Workshops will 
be on the monthly school calendar and in the Parent's Corner of our SPARK monthly 
newsletter.  Flyers will go out to parents in Spanish and English.  A handout will be given with 
an agenda and any resources that will be shared.  Attendance will be taken on a sign-in sheet.   
 
Workshops will address the following: 
* Parents will receive ideas on how to increase everyday language at home.  
* Parents will gather information on Native Literacy and how it can help develop their child's 
English.    
* Parents will become familiar with the New Language Arts Progressions.  
* Parents will become familiar with technology that can be used at home to support learning.   
* Parents will be given tips to improve literacy skills in native language while building English 
proficiency 
* Parents will be coached in how to use math strategies and appropriate academic vocabulary in 
solving word problems. 
* Parents will become more familiar with expectations for writing according to their child's level 
of English proficiency.  
* Parents will gather information on the NYSESLAT assessment.  
 
Additional workshops will be added or revised based on parent need/request.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Structures that are in place include: 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Summative or benchmark assessments are: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Once summative data has been gathered it is analyzed and used to form groups to target the specific academic and language 
needs.  AIS is provided by teachers and/or push-in providers.  Resources such as LLI, Wilson, double dose Fundations, IXL and 
RTI for GoMath are used to support the instruction.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Data from NYS ELA, Math, and NYSESLAT are used to form strategy groups by teachers in class.  AIS groups are determined and 
work to strengthen skills.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Data from NYS ELA exam, NYS math exam, and the NYSESLAT is used to inform ELL programs.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) is used to determine strengths and weaknesses of students and form groups.  This 
information is analyzed by ENL teachers along with the data specialist.  It is then distributed to classroom teachers and 
professional development meetings are given to give those using this data in order to have a better understanding of it.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The instructional model presently used at PS 68Q follows the English as a New Language (ENL) model.    Entering and emerging 
students receive 360 minutes of instruction per week.  Transitioning and expanding students receive 180 minutes of 
instruction per week.  We have two certified ENL teachers that "push in" to service our English Language Learners.  We also 
have three certified ENL teachers that are classroom teachers and service their own heterogenous ELL classes.  Integrated ENL 
classes may contain Native English students.  In addition, our literacy coach is also a certified ENL teacher.   Our school 
provides the Freestanding ENL program for ELLs as per parent choice.  Students are heterogeneously grouped by grade.  Stand 
alone ENL is delivered by a certified ENL teacher and Integrated ENL is delivered by either a dual certified teacher (ESL/CB) or 
through co-teaching by an ENL teacher and a common branch teacher depending on the class.   

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Not applicable 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Not applicable  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Integrated ENL with ELA is provided by either a dual certified teacher with an ESL and common branch license or by 
the ENL teacher along with a common branch teacher using the co-teaching model.  Commanding level students 
receive 90 minutes a week of integrated ENL in ELA by either a dual certified teacher or co-teaching model.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Our ENL program provides instruction with home language support emphasizing language acquisition.  ENL teachers 
collaborate with classroom teachers to align instruction to meet the standards.  Content is made comprehensible by 
incorporating ENL methodologies and techniques.  Lessons incorporate language objectives, vocabulary development using 
Tier I, II, and III words, activities including all four modalities - listening, speaking, reading and writing, total physical response 
(TPR), visuals and realia.    
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
 ELLs are all in Integrated ENL classes that are taught in English so assessments and evaluations are in English.   For 
assessments in mathematics or content areas translated exams and/or glossaries are provided.      
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

SIFE students are supported through home language support as well as building early literacy and foundational skills through 
Fundations.  Newcomer ELLs are provided with heavy scaffolds in lessons including visuals, picture support, home language 
support, realia, and various ENL techniques such as TPR, gesturing, acting out and repetition.  Developing ELLs receive scaffolds 
that address their specific proficiency level needs which include word banks, language structures, sentence prompts, sentence 
and paragraph frames and continued development of academic vocabulary.  No students qualify as long-term ELLs who have 
completed 6 or more years of ENL servicing.     Former ELLs are receive 90 minutes of servicing by an ENL teacher as well as 
testing modifications (time and a half on assessements).  They are monitored and supported through continued instruction 
and development of higher and more complex language structures, academic vocabulary and cognitive tasks.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE

b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

The instructional materials used to support the ELL-SWDs in the classroom include visual aids such as charts with pictures, 
manipulative materials and realia. We encourage a print-rich environment by labeling centers and objects in the room. We 
introduce word walls by using student names. We have leveled libraries to suit the interest and level of all the children. Books 
have a high level of picture support. Big books are based on everyday life experiences such as the laundromat, shopping and 
the supermarket. In the lower grades, we use Fundations to support language skills and Wilson, LLI or Reading Focus can be 
seen in the upper grades. We celebrate children’s accomplishments by hanging up their work and using their work as 
models.  In addition, we encourage the use of computers, videos and recordings. Our science teachers provide hands-on 
learning. In Social Studies children use maps and various charts. During math our students use many manipulative materials 
such as, rulers, geoboards, graphs, scales, counters, etc. to help them complete lessons. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
In order to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain English proficiency with the least restrictive environment 
modifications are made to lessons, language objectives are given, and scaffolds are provide to help students access the 
curriculum.  Instructional flexibility includes differentiated instruction and various types of grouping including whole group, 
small group and partnerships.   Flexible schedules allow for increased time on assessments, extended time for particular 
lessons, and repeated practice for lessons that require it.

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Native language libraries are used to maintain ELLs literacy skills while ENL servicing is developing their academic language 
skills in ELA and math.  Online programs such as RazKids and IXL are used as intervention programs for students below or at 
grade level.   Another online program, Lexia was started through a grant for ELLs and provides individualized literacy 
support.  GoMath offers online assignments, glossaries and videos to support lessons and offer practice in English and native 
languages.  Fundations and Wilson programs are used for struggling ELLs.  Afterschool programs use Common Core Clinic 
books which address the genres and domains as resources in ELA and mathematics.      
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Data has shown that ELL students struggle the most in the modality of writing.  ENL teachers will push-in to service ELL 
students during writing in order to support the student's with more small group instruction tailored to fit their 
needs.  Professional development will be given on guided reading in order to move the reading levels of ELL students.In 
addition, we will continue technology programs such as Lexia, RazKids, MyOn, IXL, and online GoMath website access.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

ELL students are given equal access to all school programs.  In addition, ELL specific before and afterschool programs that 
support ELA and math skills development by a certified ENL teacher are offered to our ELL population in grades 2, 3, 4 and 
5 three hours a week.  We have applied for grants that have partnered us with Arts Connection for the past 5 years.  This 
relationship has given some ELL classes an opportunity to work on increasing language through dance and recently musical 
theater.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Instructional materials that support ELLs include native language library books for independent reading, classroom charts, 
teacher-made vocabulary materials, SMARTBoards, ELMOs, and IPads.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Our ENL program offers home language support through reading materials in native language, picture rich trade books, 
translation when needed, English/native language dictionaries, peer support and partnerships and classroom charts with 
visuals that go home.  Eight ELL specific parent workshops are offered across the year and every Tuesday there is parent 
engagement time.  Surveys are distributed to gain information as to topics that parents need more support in, times which 
would be better for parents as well as for feedback on each workshop.  These surveys are translated.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

All resources and services follow grade specific curriculum for all subject areas for all ELLs.  Modifications are made in the 
planning of lessons and small groups to allow students of different English proficiency levels to meet these grade 
expectations.       
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Not applicable 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?

New ELLs are introduced to the school and have the opportunity to take a guided tour with our parent coordinator or an ENL 
teacher.  The guidance counselor checks in with self-contained ELL classroom teachers to see if support is needed for new 
ELLs.  In class, students are given different partners to provide classroom assistance throughout the day.      
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
None at this time 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

  
Not applicable 
  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Vertical meetings for ENL and ELL teachers from kindergarten through grade 5 occurs one Monday a 
month for 80 minutes.  Teacher Teams are formed cross-grade and meet on Tuesdays to study a problem 
of practice - one of these groups is designated for ELL teachers.  During professional development topics 
such as understanding CR Part 154, academic language, text complexity, issues such as language versus 
learning disability , unpacking New Language Arts Progressions and NYSESLAT are addressed.  All staff is 
provided professional development opportunities that include strategies for teaching ELLs, using TPR in 
the classroom and modifications that can be made to support ELLs in the classroom in all content areas. 
ENL teachers provide professional development for ELL differentiation during unit planning.     
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Professional development which focus’ on ELL strategies is provided during grade conferences, faculty conferences and school-
based and regional professional development sessions. Assistant Principals, common branch teachers, ENL teachers, guidance 
counselors, special education teachers, OT/PT, speech therapists and the parent coordinator are invited to staff development 
that will ensure they are working as best they can with ENL students. Staff attend curriculum training in reading and writing at 
Teachers College and at in house meetings. In addition, our content area and ENL teachers attend meetings outside of school. 
Our guidance counselor,OT/PT, speech therapists etc are involved in all in house staff development and work closely with the 
ENL department to identify the students they work with and communicate how to best address their needs. Our staff 
participates in ENL congruence days where they meet to plan lessons, discuss student progress, and reflect on instuction. In 
addition, we provide staff development on Professional Development days. We keep records of these meetings by listing 
dates, having agendas, and attendance signature sheets.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include

Guide, Professional Development section. 
Along with parent teacher conferences and initial parent orientations, quarterly progress meetings or other scheduled 
meetings are provided for parents or guardians to discuss the goals of the program and their child's language development 
progress.  Every Tuesday parents have the opportunity to meet with teachers during Parent Engagement time.  Translation is 
provided by bilingual school staff or the DOE Translation and Interpretation Unit.  Workshops are also given and end with a 
question and answer period for parents to discuss individual concerns.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, P.S. 68, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to and 
staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

We initially utilize the HLIS as a method of identifying language needs of parents. Information regarding the 
various languages of parents can be accessed through reports on ATS such as RPOB and RAPL. Student emergency 
cards indicate the preferred written and oral forms of communication so that staff members are aware before 
they contact parents and can plan for translation needs appropriately. Teachers send home personalized surveys 
to help identify the individual needs of the parents of the students in their class. We have a bilingual secretary in 
the office to address the oral language needs of parents both in person and over the phone as well as several staff 
members who assist as translators when necessary in the event that a parent of limited English proficiency enters 
the office.

event of an emergency. In addition, the school safety officer is bilingual.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 
 

Chancellor's Regulation A-663 is in regards to translation, specifically in ensuring that limited English proficient 
parents have meaningful opportunities and accessibility to information and that minors are not used to convey 
information. In order to ensure that all staff members are aware of this, CR A-663 is included with the Chancellor's 
Regulations portion of our school handbook which has a separate sign-off indicated that the chancellor's regulations 
were received and read. It will also be highlighted by administration during staff development prior to the start of the 
school year during our faculty meeting where all staff is present.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Home language is entered into ATS upon registration. Translation and interpretation will be provided to those needing 
language assistance in person, over the phone, and in written correspondences. All memos are translated in Spanish 
(our primary language), our parent coordinator can help parents to utilize NYCDOE phone translation services to 
understand any correspondence. In-house translation is provided at meetings. All meetings begin with an inquiry to 
find out if any person is in need of translation. There are also translated signs upon entering the building and in the 
main office which inquire and supports their language needs.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

We will send out a parent survey mid-year and end of year to determine parents needs. We will have translated 
feedback surveys following workshops and meetings. Title I parent money in 2015-2016 was used to purchase a 
translation device which was used throughout the school year and will continue to be used September 2018 - June 
2019.
