Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our Mission statement is as follows: “We are on a path toward reaching and exceeding standards. Our children are 
lifelong learners who are developing the skills to become the leaders and inventors of tomorrow. Our graduates 
will shape an ever-changing world and will be model citizens and responsible decision makers who promote and 
applaud diversity. They will navigate challenges and search for answers to ethical and philosophical questions that 
will help them to become deep thinkers and problem solvers. Our students will go from children to enlightened, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

independent young adults who value education and respect society. We will create a community of learners that 
can not only draft the blueprint but can redesign it- one life, one institution, one community at a time. 

We will provide them with knowledge, skills, and real world experience to achieve a productive and fulfilling life. 
We will promote academic excellence through high levels of proficiency in reading and mathematics. Technology 
will be a tool to enhance and expand curriculum content, skills and assessment. The education community will 
honor and advocate for parent involvement and a shared decision making process with our community partners, 
Our school will build on its commitment to providing our children with rich cultural experiences in the arts as they 
relate to our learning process.” 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Due to the expansion of MS 337 over the past three years, beginning in the 2016-2017 school year, we relocated to 
the third and fourth floors. Over the past three years, 337 has grown from 330 students to over 550 students in 
grades 6,7 and 8. This is a high poverty area whose population is primarily composed of Hispanics (56%) African-
Americans (40%), Caucasians (1%) and Asians (2%). Our population is highly mobile because more than 27% of our 
students are in temporary housing. MS 337 is comprised of 6, 7, and 8 grades. Each grade will be divided into 
cohorts comprised of six per grade.  

Flexible cohort meetings are held weekly in accordance with the needs of the teachers and curriculum. The purpose 
of these meetings is to develop strategies and ways to improve student performance, minimize behavioral 
problems, address individual academic needs and deliver a united inter-disciplinary curriculum.  

Ideally, each SISJ class will be comprised of twenty-five students or less. The cohort is designed to help students 
feel connected to a nested community within a school environment providing emotional and academic support. 
Cohort/Team meetings also provide parents the opportunity to meet with parents to discuss student progress.  

The 2017-2018 progress report indicates we are performing aboveStudents performing at levels 3/4 increased from 
43% in 2017 47% in 2018 for Math. In ELA, progress was also shown as students performing at levels 3/4 increased 
from 43% in 2017 to 48 % in 2018.  

In grade 8, MS 337 had 100% pass rate in both Regents courses that were offered to students; Integrated Algebra 
and American History.   

Due to the success of our ELL population, we were asked to create an ELL academy. Which continues to show 
success. To date, we have instructed French, Arabic, Bengali and Chinese non-English speaking students and moved 
them to the expanding or commanding NYSELAT level in three years.  

During the 2017-2018 school years, we set a goal to increase parent involvement. Proof of growth was measured by 
parent participation in the NYC School Survey and, parent participation in SLT/Title I, PTA meetings. Survey results 
for the 2016-2017 school year indicated that 58% of our parents completed and submitted the survey. This was a 
drop from the previous year’s performance. We are examining our strategy and will make the necessary 
adjustments to bring the participation levels up to the 75% rate.  

While we have seen a significant increase in parent participation in SLT, PTA and Title I meetings, there is still room 
for improvement. Our current PTA executive board has taken an active role in the school and in parent outreach. 
They work closely with our parent coordinator to increase parent participation and with outreach to surrounding 
schools recruiting incoming students. As a result, we have seen a steady increase in our population over the past 
three years. This year we will accept 220 students into our grade six class. We plan to accept a minimum of 200 
every year moving forward. Our plan is to maintain a school population of approximately 600 students.  

MS 337 applied for two grant programs in 2014. The Middle School Arts initiative allowed us to hire two teachers of 
the arts. We are in the final year of this grant and have a music specialist on staff for the past two years. The 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Summer Quest funding was not supplied for the 2016-2017 school year. 337 has entered a partnership with Sports 
and Arts Foundation to provide a Summer Program for incoming and current students.  

MS 337 prides itself on being a “Full Service” school. We utilize community based contact to assist our families’ 
needs. We have formed a strong partnership with the Bronx Borough Presidents office, NY State Assembly member 
Marcos Crespo and, NY City Council member Annabell Palma. Looking to the future, the 123/337 Campus will have 
a full service on site medical clinic to serve the needs of our community.  

 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our population is highly mobile because more than 15% of our students are in temporary housing. We will continue 
to educate all IEP students in the Least Restrictive Environment. This will be accomplished by using flexible 
scheduling as well as increasing the number of Integrated Co Teaching positions. We will continue to seek teaching 
staff with dual certifications and, content area certification to provide the possible use of our financial resources.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Using the Framework for great schools, we are focusing on academic rigor and student movement toward 
proficiency in English Language Arts and Mathematics. Additionally, Students With Disabilities (SWD) and English 
Language Learners (ELL) have shown significant improvement on State Assessments. SWD Students performing at 
levels 3/4 in ELA increased from 14% in 2017to 12% in 2018. ELL students performing at levels 3/4 in ELA increased 
from 6% in 2017 to 9% in 2018. SWD students performing at levels 3/4 in Math increased from 11% in 2017 to 13 % 
in 2018. ELL students performing at levels 3/4 in Math increased from 11% in 2017 to 12% in 2018. During the 2015-
2016 school year, MS 337 moved from a Tier II school to Tier I.  

Consequently, our area of focus is our SWDs in ELA. 

Significant gains will be updated as more data analysis is available throughout the year. 

Our focus will continue to be improving student achievement for all students. This is supported by rigorous instruction 
for all students. We will accomplish this by continuing to develop our staff and providing support via content area and 
grade level meetings held weekly. In addition, we have continued to conduct extensive training, planning and 
professional development during the summer with all current and new staff. In order to support collaboration of the 
teaching staff, we have senior teacher mentoring and supporting newer staff members.  

The current structure of 337 allows the three building administrators to focus on instruction and supporting teachers 
as all operational matters are handled by our operations manager. This allows for more classroom support and 
observations to improve instruction.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
During the 2018-2019 school year we will continue to implement our Response To Intervention team, expanding it to 
include all of our grades 6, 7, 8. RTI is designed to accelerate students' literacy and match proficiency by monitoring 
the effectiveness of the program and other interventions. RTI cyles will be modified through ongoing assessment, 
collaboration, and research. 

Based upon the data assessment for the 2018-2019 school year, we are continuing to focus on academic rigor. We will 
utilize the "cite from text method" in all disciplines to achieve this improvement. The proficiency levels last year in ELA 
were 48% and 47% in math, from 43% and 43%, respectively.  

MS 337 continued its 100% pass rate on the Algebra Common Core Regents exam and the Common Core American 
History Regents for the 2017-2018 school year. This data shows that 100% of our grade 8 students who sat for the 
Algebra and American History regents passed with a score above 85%.  

Based upon the most recent data from NYSED, in ELA SWD(Students with Disabilities) went from 14% proficient in 
2017 to 12% proficient in 2018. ELLS(English Language Learners) went from 6% proficient to 9% proficient, a 3% 
increase over the prior year. SWDs in math went from 11% in 2017 to 13% in 2018. ELLs in Math went from 11% in 
2017 to 12% in 2018. 
 
 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, as the result of our intensified independent reading initiative, we will decrease the number of students 
at level 1 in ELA by 5% (i.e. 20% reduced to 15%) and increase the number of students who are proficient by 7% (i.e. 
48% increased to 55%) as measured by the New York State ELA exam. In math, as a result of the incorporation of 
spiraled review across all grades, we will decrease the number of students at level 1 by 7% (i.e. 22% reduced to 15%)

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

We will achieve these increased proficiency scores by closely 
tracking and responding to student data. We will monitor 
progress daily and give beginning of year, middle year, and end 
of year benchmark tests to assess progress toward the June 
target. 

We will identify students in need of RTI services, offered on a 
cyclical basis, through ongoing formative and summative 
assessments. RTI services will be modified according to student 
data and teacher collaboration.  

We will offer after school tutoring to help students reach their 
academic goals.

Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
MS337 will provide students with a safe, affirming environment that fosters academic and character growth for all. 
Teachers and staff will work together to build social-emotional awareness in order to maximize learning and 
decrease behavioral incidents. Progress toward this goal will be monitored by our school quality snapshot, parent 
surveys, and OORS data. 

According to parent/student surveys, 66% of students agree/strongly agree that they feel safe outside their school, 
68% of students feel that discipline is applied fairly in school, 81% agree/strongly agree that they feel safe in the 
hallways and bathrooms of the school, 91% of students agree/strongly agree that they feel safe in their classes at 
school. We are proud to report that 98% of staff, 62% of parents, and 98% of students completed the school 
surveys. 

Therefore, we can conclude that safety in school is a strength. In order to improve these numbers further, we want 
to work on reducing OORS incidences by working on students' social-emotional learning. In 2017/18 the OORS 
incident numbers were ...****ADD IN****  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Analyzing teacher Advance data has allowed MS 337 to determine areas of strength and areas of growth. This has 
provided a baseline to correlate specific weekly professional development, based on the Danielson Framework for 
teachers. In addition to feedback by administration, Peer Collaborative Teachers work with groups of teachers to 
focus on specific feedback provided by administration with timely and measurable next steps.  

Based upon Advance data, the schools' strengths are in designing coherent instruction that intellectually engages our 
students in order to make them college and career ready. Based upon analysis of Advance data for 2018-2019, our 
teachers need to focus on improving the assessment of students during the instructional day. This includes , intra-
measurements, progress monitoring, frequent checks for understanding during the daily lesson and progress 
monitoring of student goals. Professional development will be designed to improve this focus area. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, as a result of teacher participation in collaborative inquiry cycles focused on analysis of student 
learning (using weekly progress monitoring, on the spot assessment, and the ASL protocol for student work), we will 
see an increase in teacher use of data driven small group guided instruction as measured by an increase of 0.25 in 
Advance rating for domain 3. This will result in an increase in proficiency levels in ELA by 7% and an increase in 
proficiency levels in Math by 8% as measured by the NYSED exams.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

We will increase the average rating of teachers in domain 3 
through high quality, differentiated professional development, 
targeted rounds of observation, and opportunities for inter-
visitation and peer to peer feedback.  

We will offer lab classrooms whereby teachers can observe 
instructional strategies and management techniques.   

We will conduct weekly progress monitoring meetings and will 
use ASL protocol to determine areas of focus to guide our 
instruction. We will also use ASL protocol during daily 
collaboration between teacher teams in order to modify the 
curriculum as necessary in order to see increased student 
proficiency.

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Administration uses their highly effective teachers as mentors and lead teachers to improve the instructional 
practices of new and struggling teachers. Through this building capacity, administration develops a strong team of 
teachers.  

Due to the expansion of MS337, we have more new teachers and a full staff for the 2018/19 school year. Our new 
teachers are a focus for administrative support. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
 

By June 2019, as a result of new teacher participation in lead teacher facilitated inter-visitation and individualized 
coaching, 90% of first year year teachers will show growth of at least 0.5 from the beginning of the year to the end of 
the year on their Advance ratings. This improvement in demonstrated teacher pedagogy will result in increased 
student mastery of standards as measured from baseline to mid-line to end of year benchmarks.

Administration will meet this goal by providing mentoring to the 
lead teachers so they, in turn, can effectively coach new and 
struggling teachers. These teachers will receive both evaluative 
and non-evaluative individualized feedback, and the combined 
results of this coaching will be evidenced by successive 
improvement in advance ratings.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Parent involvement has been a challenge over the past three years, as evidenced by the data showing a drop in the 
number of parents completing the survey. During the 2017-18 school year, there was an increase of 6% in the 
number of parents responding to the learning environment survey. Parent participation continues to be a concern. 
There was a 2% increase in the number of parents attending PTA meetings.

identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, as a result of providing 4 interim progress reports to parents that detail the academic growth of their 
child, we will see a 10% increase in the participation rate by parents in the annual School Survey and an increase of 0.05 
in the ratings posted by parents in the section "Strong Family-Community Ties". This increased parent involvement will 
result in a 1% increase in student attendance. (from 94% to 95%).

communication between families and school. Furthermore, with 
the support of our CBOs and our PTA, we believe this increase in 
communication and involvement will lead to an increase in 
parental attendance at school events (e.g. parent teacher 
conferences, student performances). The progress reports and 
technology portals will build a bridge between families and

337 has created the mandatory set aside for Students in Temporary Housing. This has allowed us to purchase 
uniforms and all the basic necessities for the affected students. In addition, funds from the Summer Quest grant 
allowed us to purchase enough uniform shirts to provide every student with 2 shirts each for free. We currently have 
a strong relationship with the Borough Presidents' office of Constituent Services which assist families with housing 
matters as well as any other services they may require.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another

purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. MS 337, School For Inquiry And Social Justice] , in compliance with the Section 
1118 of Title I, Part A of the "No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act has been updated to, Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), 
is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of 
student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed 
by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are 
encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee 
as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

MS 337, School For Inquiry And Social Justice] will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The term 
ESSA has been updated from (NCLB) No Child Left Behind. 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

 

The school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support

The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.



  # and types of certified teachers 


Begin description here:            
   
     The rationale for  direct instruction for our  (ELLs) English Language Learners is based on 
several data comparisons. After reviewing the ELL Data from our NYSESLAT, 18% of our 
students are commanding students for the year 2018-2019.  English language learners who 
scored at or below the  25th growth percentile in ELA is  52%. Nearly  52%  scored between 
1.66-1.98 on ELA. These students are all  pushable 2.  ELLs who scored at or below 
the  25th  growth  in Math was 48%. Forty-eight percent of our  ELL student  math scores 
ranged  between 1.35-1.95. Also,  based on the NYSESLAT exam we have 25 long-term 
ELLs.  We have a total of 78 students. Nearly 50% of our students are expanding, twenty-one 
percent are transitional students,  seven percent are emerging students and 1 percent 
entering.  Students scored the lowest on the writing  modality based on the NYSESLAT. Nearly 
fifty percent scored in  single digits as opposed to reading, listening, and speaking. 
     Sub-groups of students to be served is based on the data reports. Long-term ELL's and 
students who fall in the lowest third    have been identified to receive additional support. There is 
a  two-fold agenda for these students. The instructional focus will be as follows;  1) Teaching 
Students to write effectively  and  2) Teaching  Academic Content with a focus on  Academic 
Vocabulary.  English language learners lack opportunities to develop the sophisticated, abstract, 
academic vocabulary necessary to support reading, writing, and discussion in the content area. 
We will provide explicit instruction in the following manner; 
Activities students will be engaged in this year are the following;  
A)  Choose a brief, engaging piece of informational text that includes academic vocabulary as a 
platform for intensive academic vocabulary instruction. B)  We will choose a small set of 
academic vocabulary for in-depth instruction. C)  We will teach academic vocabulary in 
depth using multiple modalities ( writing, speaking, listening) D)  We will teach word-learning 
strategies to help students independently figure out the meaning of words. E)  Provide 
opportunities for students to use words in sentences and understand multiple meanings. F)  We 
will teach word parts in order for student to gain a deeper understanding and knowledge of how 
words form meaning. ( Prefix, suffix, antonym, synonyms, verbs, nouns, adjectives, etc.)  G)  We 
will allow students to work in pairs in order and use the mock interview format. Students will 
respond to each others questions.H) We will provide opportunities for students to use words 
when writing.  
 
     The  Extended Learning Time Program will run on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. The 
program will begin  October 2018 through April 2019. The languages of instruction will be 
provided in English and Spanish. Home language support will be provided. Teachers will 
provide direct instruction using parallel teaching. Students with the most need will be provided 
with  Bilingual Assistant for additional support. Our  ENL students have full access to the library 
which is used as a media source.  
     Our English Language Learners are housed in the ENL Library Media Center. They will have 
access to several media programs and games as well. This year we are using "Games to learn

English". This program enables students to practice English in a fun way. This site is a resource 
language learners can use independently using text based instructions.   
     Our students will use informational text from "ReadWorks"  and "StudySync." We have 
renewed our prescription for another year with studysync so students will have access to rich 
informational and literary text.  "Students will continue to be exposed to a Twenty-First Century 
English Language Arts technology program geared towards customizing or differentiating 
instruction. This program  will ensure student's receive direct instruction by first introducing a 
skill, and then allowing students to use the "Close Read" strategy before annotating the text. The 
instruction around each text begins with a First Read lesson. Within each unit students will be 
exposed to Study Sync TV episodes. Study Sync TV contains additional meta-cognitive 
questions in which students re-examine short clips from the video to analyze how students in the 
model discussion construct meaning and express themselves effectively using academic 
vocabulary and discussion skills. 
      Types of materials we will use for this program is supported  by "Study 
Sync" published by McGraw Hill, "Read Works", and the "Games to Learn English" 
programs.  Finally, this year our ENL students will continue to use "Google 
Classroom".  Assignments will be assigned on line and students will have the opportunity to 
work in pairs or triads. Assignments will be designed to meet the needs of each students 
individual challenges and strengths.  We will progress monitor each student and discuss on-
going progress as well as challenges.

Begin description here:            
     The rational for ongoing effective  professional development enables teachers to develop the 
knowledge and skills they need to address students' learning challenges. Professional learning is 
the link between teachers'  individual skills,  knowledge and the contribution they make to our 
students. Our goal is to provide the 50% required professional development to our ENL teachers 
and 15% mandated professional development for our general education teachers. This year we 
have eight new teachers and are excited to provide quality professional development learning 
opportunities. After meeting with the Principal, Andrea Cyprys, Asst Principal, 
Almoree Hercules, Kristy Delacruz, and Juan Otero on September 28th, we have 
narrowed  down the professional development that should provide  the necessary support our 
students this year.  The instructional focus will be on "How to scaffold for different proficiency 
levels."  
     All teachers working in the Title III program will receive on-going PD related to the 
ENL  program during extended day on Mondays.   Mrs. Pogue is a licensed 
ESL/TESOL Instructor who is capable of providing professional development. The professional

translationParent Involvement is a key component of the programs & services for parents of 
English Language Learners. We encourage parents to  get involved in the planning, 
implementation, and evaluation of our Title III Program. We welcome parents to collaboratively 
be a part of our ESL Advisory Team which works in conjunction with our Parents Association. 
We want to provide leadership and learning opportunities for our ESL parents. We offered a 
workshop this past November for parents of General Ed and ENL  in order to prepare their 
students for high-school. ENL parents attended and were provided with key information and 
resources. We endeavor to offer workshops that will expand the acculturation skills of our 
second language families, offer informational meetings that will help second language parents 
better understand the curriculum and support their student, offer second language families an 
interpreter at parent meetings, IEPs and other events, and build relationships with local 
community partners and work  to provide resources to our second language families. Parents will 
also learn how the New York State has changed performance expectations for students, including 
English Language Learners (ELLs), and become familiar with Latino Authors and book titles to 
add to their home libraries. Parents will be accommodated in their native language via on 
site translation when necessary.     Currently, we are reviewing possible workshop ideas based 
upon parent feedback.   All records of Title III activities will be maintained at school level in the 
ESL/ELL binder.  
Currently, we keep all parents of ENL students up to date by providing a brochure to each parent 
in their the language of their choice  detailing  (NYSESLAT)  New York State English as a 
Second Language  Testing.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
We use formative and summative assessments to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLS. Our formative assessments  are 
created by a team of teachers responsible for their grade level or course. A collaborative team of teachers responsible for the 
same course and grade creates a common formative assessment before teaching a unit.  Teacher created assessments allow 
the team to differentiate the instruction.  Due to the complexity of text  based on the Common Core Standards, we use 
Curriculum Associates (Ready - New York CCLS ) to determine their strengths and weaknesses in reading and math. We also 
use Max Scholar;  an on-line reading program for students Prek-12th grade which uses the Orton-Gillingham  approach. 
The  data provides our school with the instructional goals we will focus  on for the year. For example, last year we realized 
students  were struggling to understand complex text. We focused on improving their understanding of the academic language 
embedded within  the text. Students were able to not only read difficult text,  but comprehend difficult text.  This year 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

according to our NYSESLAT scores, we noticed our ELL students have remained stagnate at the Expanding level. Based on 
these  patterns and trends over the past three years we implementing  the following;  
1.  Utilize the ELL periodic assessment to determine how to differentiate instruction to meet every students needs. 
2. Use the students baselines to determine strengths and challenges.  
3. Use the EDAT TOOL to determine why students are at risk in  English Language Arts and Mathematics.  
4. Utilize the Teacher's College Rubric and Student checklist along with students to process monitor their success. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

New programs with computer access have been purchased.  Students are provided with instruction on computers using Max 
Scholar. The focus is on phonics, max word, max reading, and grammatical rules.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
A)  We use assessment data, portfolio results and standardized test results. The beginning of the year assessment will identify 
what students are in need of academic interventions, and what skills the ESL Teacher should focus on. The mid-year 
assessment determines what students are in jeopardy academically, and what skills are needed for them to be successful. The 
mid-line assessment also enables our team to collaboratively identify what is working, and what modifications are 
needed.  The final assessment is given in June to determine whether we need to re-teach a certain skill,  and what growth did 
our student make. Also, We are able to evaluate whether the Problem-Solving Model of implementation of interventions 
for  individual student needs and Standard Protocol Model of interventions  designed for small group was successful. Using the 
RTI  Program and the ESL Integration program. The formative assessments  given throughout the year  includes the baseline 
assessments, content area unit test, and the ELL Periodic assessment test.  This year we are using the EDAT Tool heavily to 
support our teachers who have ENL Students in their classes. Data from the tool has been shared with teachers so they will be 
able to support not only the ENL Population but our General Education and SWD.  
B) Summative Assessments  include the following; These assessments will help guide instructional decisions at the school level 
by showing trends; and informs students and families on their progress.  
1. New York State English Exam2. New York State Math Exam3. District Benchmark exams; Periodic Assessment ENL4. Weekly 
spelling test5. End - of - Unit test 
Formative Assessment include the following; 
1. Anecdotal notes during lessons2. Records of reading behaviors ( formal or informal) 3. Performance Based Assessments.  
C)  We will also use progress monitoring to determine and support each students challenges as well as their strenghts.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

1)  Analyzing Student  Learning TemplateDuring PLC Meetings ENL Teachers as well as grade leaders will analyze student 
learning by providing ENL Teachers with mentoring support. Based on the assessments given in the fall, we will use this data to 
identify students performing at each level . Far below standard, approaching standard, meeting standard, and exceeding 
standards. We will focus on areas of strength, areas of need, and steps we should take to provide small group instruction for 
students who fall within each category. These focus groups will be implemented so  students can receive support geared 
towards their specific needs.  
 
 
 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
All data collected is analyzed on a regular basis (weekly) to assess student progress.  This is done during weekly team, grade 
and content area meetings.  Each student is discussed and their portfolio is reviewed.  if necessary, parent conferences are 
also held to discuss student progress. Our goal is to keep students on track for success and  celebration. ELLs are pulled out for 
Response to Intervention sevices in both ELA and Mathematics. During a six week window, students are provided with 
instruction mirrored to what the content area teacher is teaching and the skills indentified based on the data. They receive 
quality, scientificallly validated instructional practices based on assessment of learner needs, monitoring students' pogress, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

 

and adjusting the  interventions based on the students' responsiveness. Our goal has been to match needs to resources  using 
a collaborative team effort. Many of our  ELLs are under the Tier II Model. They receive targeted interventions in a small group 
setting and their progress is monitored more closely. ELLs who  falll under the Tier III Model  receive individualized, intensive 
interventions by targeting the specific  skills they lack. Content area teachers use our Para-Professionals to provide additional 
support to target the deficit skill as needed. Students who are advanced remain  within the Tier 1 Model.   Instruction is 
differentiated as needed during common planning time with grade team.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Current analysis of the data has shown that our focus on tailoring programs of instruction by providing small group settings 
with additional teachers/ academic support is one reason we are having so much success.  The concentrated/collaborative 
team work has enabled us to push many ELLs'  into proficiency by the time they reach grade 8.   The ELL DATA Analysis has 
been shared with every teacher and further supports our plan for small group instruction for our entering and emerging 
students.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Regular meetings with teacher teams, parents, and students. Based on our data, we will re-visit the instructional focus to 
determine whether the course of action taken leads to improvement?  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The Language Acquisition Program at MS 337 is an inclusive one where the ESL teacher provides language acquisition 
services through a rigorous academic program  for experiential learning.  Our goal is to provide children with valuable 
and enriching connections with text to text, text to self, and text to  world connections.  We encourage students to 
share their cultures, belief systems and heritage in classes.  
  
Instruction is delivered in the following way; 1) using ATS , students are programed into STARS to reflect their 
mandated services and to ensure students are programmed for the requisite minutes. 2) Stand-Alone ENL Pull-
Out;   Only Entering and Emerging students at MS 337 receive Stand-Alone ENL. These students lack the language 
proficiency to understand the content so they are provided with additional instruction that will focus on 
grammatical  rules.  
3)  Integrated Program;   Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding students will be provided with support in class. 
ENL Teachers will work along side the content area teacher on a regular basis.  
   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Teachers meet with the coaches and principal by content area and grade to discuss and plan.  Additionally, progress of 
each student is discussed and appropriate strategies are created to assure student success.  All services are provided within 
the regular classroom setting.  Students are grouped by their grade and assigned to classes based upon their academic needs.   
  
All instruction is delivered in English within the regular classroom setting.  Students with IEP’s receive instruction in their IEP 
mandated setting i.e., Self Contained services are delivered during instructional time for ELA, Social Studies, Science and Math 
based upon lesson plans and identified needs of students.  The same is true for students receiving CTT/ICT services.    
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   Student learning styles are assessed when they enter the school.  Based upon the results of these assessments, the necessary 
differentiation is implemented.  Additionally, all lessons are Scaffolded to support student learning.  A sample of the SIOP 
lesson plan used by all teachers is included at the end of this document.   
  
Additional AIS (Academic Intervention Services) services are provided to address the needs of Long Term ELL’s and, students 
identified as needing additional assistance are   detailed below.   
  
  
•         AIS Push In a minimum of 10 hours per week based upon the specific reading and/or writing modality of each 
student.  The AIS program used the Balanced Literacy program based upon student data.  Student data was used to support 
their specific linguistic and academic needs to deliver appropriate AIS services.  Student progress was monitored on a monthly 
basis.  The ITA’s were used to assess students and further drive instruction.  AIS services are also provided in Mathematics 
based upon student needs.  
  
•         AIS Pull Out services a minimum of 10 per week based upon the modality of each student.    The AIS program used the 
Balanced Literacy program based upon student data.  Student data was used to support their specific needs to deliver 
appropriate AIS services.  The ITA’s were used to assess students and further drive instruction.  AIS services are also provided 
in Mathematics based upon student needs.   
The number of hours a student receives AIS is based upon data and teacher evaluation.  Students whose data shows weakness 
in areas of the modalities (reading /writing and listening/speaking) receive one period per day. Additionally, all students 
attended the extended day sessions.  Our extended day is seventy five minutes each day on Tuesday and Wednesday.  The AIS 
Balanced Literacy Program shadowed our curriculum maps in ELA for each grade.  The maps were organized by genera, skills 
and strategies for each month.  Students who displayed difficulty in these skills and strategies were grouped for AIS pull out 
services.  The skills and strategies were reviewed and reinforced using additional materials in small group instruction (1:3) to 
ensure success.  These materials included: 
•     Progress Coach 
•     Ladders to Success 
•     NY Listening 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

•     Various materials from Literature books 
•        Students were grouped based upon modality with the ESL/ELL teacher using the GOALS program.  The GOALS program is 
used in the following way: 
  
o   To provide explicit teaching instruction 
o   Focus on reading strategies 
•     Scaffold Material to ensure reading success 
       The following materials and/or textbooks were used for the extended day literacy program: Signature Reading 
•         The mandated number of hours required for our ESL student was provided as follows: 
o   6  grade– minimum of 360 minutes weekly   
o   7 grade – minimum of 360 minutes weekly 
o   8 grade – 180 minutes weekly 
All services outlined above, are services delivered over and above these mandates.   
  
  
  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

P Within ten days of the student' enrollment,  the ESL teacher will notify the parent in writing of the student's eligibiltiy to 
participate, the type , and amount of ESL services. 
9. Parents are given an orientation on the school community and the free-standing ESL program the school provides. During 
the orientation, parents are made aware of the various language acquisition programs in New York City Public Schools. Parents 
may choose from Dual Language,  Bilingual or Freestanding ESL programs: understanding that only freestanding ESL is 
availaable at MS 337.  The ESL teaacher along with the Parent Coordinator shows the ELL Parent Orientation Video and assist 
parents in completing the Parent Survey &b Program Selection Form. Parents are informed that MS 337 does not currently 
have a tranistional bliligual or dual language program.  
10. In addition to ESL serivices, the ESL teacher provides technical assistance to classroom teachers to ensure that effective 
Sheltered Instruction strategies and modifications are in place.  
11. The ESL teacher administers the NYSESLAT  every spring and informs the programmer of the changes to be made given the 
students'  
language acquisitin progress.  
12. Spanish is the predominant language spoken by our ESL/ELL students.  Students identified as qualifying for ESL/ELL services 
on the BESIS reports are given letters explaining the services the students are entitled to receive.  These letters are available in 
their native languages for parents to sign and return to the school.   Additionally, parents are contacted by phone and if 
necessary, home visits are made to assure that parents are aware of the services their children are entitled to.   
13. Monthly meetings are held for parents and ESL/ELL students to ensure continuous contact with the home and, to highlight 
and celebrate achievements.      
14. Additionally,  students who come from elementary schools  where they have received ESL  services  and have not tested 
out, receive the continuation of services letter to be signed by a parent or guardian and returned.   
15. After reviewing the Parent Survey and Program Selection Forms for the past few years many parents are requesting for 
their children to receive English as a Second Language Services in hope that they will become fully acquainted with language 
on a daily basis by interacting with their peers.  
16. The programs we offer are aligned with parent request. We offer the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocal (SIOP) 
Model. This model allows students to tap into their prior learning experiences while learing new material. This is a school wide 
initiative that has proven to work well at MS 337 thus far.  ste response to questions 1-6 here   aste response to question

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Andrea Cyprys, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The data collected when a student enters the NYC school system is used to make the preliminary determination 
regarding a parent/guardian's language preferance. In addition, all incoming parents are interviewed by the 
administrators, teachers and Parent Coordinator. This allows us to make the necessary notes regarding 
communication with these families. When a parent meeting is scheduled, we ask the parent/guardian what their 
preferred language is. Currently, we have the ability to translate/interpert in the following languages; Spanish, 
French. Outside services are used when necessary.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.
