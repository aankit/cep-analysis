Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

It shall be the mission of PS 17 to provide every child with equal access to all available resources enabling them to 
reach their full intellectual, emotional, and social maturation during their time at PS 17. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

PS 17 is a Title I Targeted Assistance school located in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. Although the 
demographics of the neighborhood are changing, we serve a largely Hispanic population in our PreK-5 school. We are 
part of a campus setting and share our building with MS 577 with whom we have collaborated on a number of 
academic, co-curricular, and fundraising activities such as the Relay for Life recently hosted by us at our campus site. 
PS 17 has engaged in collaborations with organizations such as the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens Project Green Reach, 
Lincoln Center, Marquis Studios, the Williamsburg Movement and Arts Center, and the St. Nick's Alliance.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We have significant ELL and special needs populations (3 self-contained and 7 ICT classes). Basic literacy (reading and 
writing) and math (computation and word problem solving) skills need to be addressed in all grades.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our school made tremendous progress in the area of teacher collaboration with the continuation of TEAMS last year. 
Teachers volunteered to participate in a team of their choice, selected from the areas of ELA, math, science, social 
studies, special education, and communication. Teams meet during the Monday professional learning community 
time block and discuss areas of need and suggest a variety of learning opportunities/projects for the school to engage 
in such as reciprocal teaching in ELA and other disciplines, and the use of Exemplars in Math. We will continue the 
excellent groundwork from 2016-17 and 2017-18 this year and have all teams fully functional and operational at the 
beginning of the 2018-19 school year. A second area where great progress was made was in parental engagement. 
Teachers and paraprofessionals used the Tuesday block after school to update their class websites, conduct parent 
meetings, and provide workshops in content areas to help promote greater strength in parent involvement and 
knowledge of school curriculum. This, too, is an area where we will build on last year’s successes and commence 
activities immediately for 2018-19.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
As a result of feedback from staff and parents it is clear that we need to improve and increase the level of parental 
involvement at PS 17. While attendance at each of the Parent-Teacher gatherings was extremely strong, other events 
were less well attended. Parent workshops and PTA meetings were poorly attended. State assessment results in both 
ELA and Math are disappointing. Our emphasis will be on examining our growth in student writing and to come to a 
more thorough understanding of what constitutes "rigorous" instruction as we look more carefully and diligently as a 
staff at student work. The work of a teacher leader has helped enormously by crafting a pathway to support our 
growth in this area. The PTA and Parent Coordinator will continue to solicit parental input throughout the school year. 
Staff and student needs will be communicated through Monday PLC sessions and common planning periods 
throughout the school year.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
To improve the delivery of rigorous instruction in literacy to the students by providing ongoing professional learning 
experiences for the instructional staff in reciprocal teaching strategies throughout the 2018-2019 school year. This will 
include inter-visitations within the PS staff as well as off-campus sites and working closely with teaching staff from MS 
577 utilizing Monday professional development time towards this end. Progress will be monitored through classroom 
observations to determine student-level proficiency in adopting the roles and routines of this teaching strategy. In 
addition, teacher meetings during common planning periods will provide opportunities for the discussion of salient 
elements of the reciprocal teaching approach.

and Time-bound. 
The school invested in the purchase of anti-bullying resources from Sussman Education Company for students in 
Grades K- 5 for use during the 2017-18 school year. We will continue to make use of this curriculum resource in 2018-
19 in order to maintain consistency throughout the grades, throughout the school year. In addition, we will be 
implementing the Sanford Harmony social/emotional learning program to promote stronger relationship-building 
throughout our PS 17 school community. The goal is to improve student-to-student relationships so as to minimize 
conflict and promote greater understanding of one another. Feedback from staff, students, and periods solicited 
throughout the year will help monitor the impact of these initiatives.

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The 2017-18 PPR, teacher MOLP, and school survey results are used to identify strengths and weaknesses which the 
administration will continuously seek to analyze and improve upon throughout the 2018-2019 school year. Feedback 
on the surveys suggests a high level of trust and satisfaction towards the administration. Efforts will continue to 
emphasize the maximum inclusion and participation of parents and staff in determining the current and future 
direction of our school.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
To provide administrative support and leadership in improving the professional learning experiences for all staff 
members during the 2018-19 school year. This will include additional professional development for reading and math 
reciprocal teaching strategies, the STEMPilot initiative, and the introduction of the new Passport to Social Studies 
curriculum. This will take place during Monday PD sessions, common planning periods and special professional 
development blocks with invited experts to address staff concerns/questions in these content areas. This will also 
include (pending the availability of funding in the school budget)the continuation of a model teacher position to assist in 
the development of reciprocal teaching strategies on an ongoing basis throughout the year.

Parents will be invited into classrooms in order to see how reciprocal teaching strategies are implemented so they will 
be better able to support these efforts at home. In addition, monthly "Breakfast with the Principal" sessions will be 
continued in order to provide a less formal environment for the exchange of ideas and suggestions and encourage 
greater parental involvement throughout the year. PTA Executive Board members, the Parent Coordinator, and the 
School Leadership Team will be key personnel involved in this endeavor throughout the 2018-2019 school year.

welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The most recent NYC school survey indicates quite clearly that PS 17 has created a warm and inviting environment for 
staff, students, and parents. As a result of feedback from staff and parents it is clear that we continue to need to 
improve and increase the level of parental involvement at PS 17. While attendance at each of the Parent-Teacher 
gatherings was extremely strong, other events were less well attended. Parent workshops and PTA meetings were 
poorly attended. Parent Coordinator outreach for the scheduling of parent workshops throughout the year have been 
initiated to include topics suggested by parents through PTA surveys.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
The goal is to increase parent knowledge and involvement in the academic and social events affecting all children by 
June, 2019.

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement.

Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. 14K017 Henry D. Woodworth, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

PS 17 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

  host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise 

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right 
to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 
and other applicable sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

PS 17’S DIRECT INSTRUCTION SUPPLEMENTAL ELL After School ProgramWe have determined that 
the most appropriate instructional focus for our After School Program is to deliver supplementary 
differentiated instruction to reinforce concepts and ideas.  The students receive close instruction from 
teachers who know them, and are well aware of their learning styles. Most children need the after school 
support to reinforce the new concepts taught during the school hours, and also to complete their home works. 
Most ELLs do not have the support at home.   
RATIONALEOur Title III funded, direct instruction supplemental program is designed to complement our 
core Freestanding Stand Alone integrated ENL instruction required under CR Part 154.   The curriculum, and 
methodology focus on foundational skills, such as phonics and fluency, and help with vocabulary 
acquirement, and reading comprehension. 
Our Title III instructional program  provides our ELLs with support and effective scaffolds for their L2 
language acquisition.  It is also programmed to assist our ELLs in their L2 language learning, language 
development, assimilation and acculturation for social and emotional growth as well as to target our ELLs' 
academic needs in such a fashion to remain true to "The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) of 2015.Based 
on previous years' after school program’s attendance data;  we believe that the teacher to ELL ratio  will need 
to remain at one to ten)  to successfully deliver standard based - instruction needed for L2 language 
development, and address the linguistic and academic needs of our ELLs in small groups.  By providing 
“comprehensive input” and by lowering “affective filters”,  we create an optimal learning environment that 
nourishes social, emotional and empathetic growth for seamless assimilation, and acculturation to promote 
optimal learning.  Our ELLs feel belonged, learn life skills, and will acquire the L2 language skills needed to 
succeed.  The collegial environment will be conducive to cognitive development and excellence in 
workmanship that will prepare students for college, and beyond. 
Subgroups and grade levels of students to be served 
All ELLs in Grades K-5 are invited to attend PS 017 K’s  ELL After School Program.The ELLs’ families 
received a survey on October 1st 2018 to indicate their interest or lack of for the ENL After School Program 
commencing November 1st 2018.  Our Title III program requires and involves ELLs' parents, administration, 
teachers , SBST, and staff to work together in order to achieve the program’s objectives under ESSA, and the 
Common Core Standards State Initiatives, and as described above. 
Group 1 :   9  students grades 3-5; the focus is supplementary differentiated instruction - Ms. Saney & Ms. 
ByrdGroup 2 :   9  students grades K-2; the focus is supplementary differentiated instruction - Ms. Reichert & 
Saney 
We will have flexible grouping with students and flexible schedule for common Branch teachers. Ms. Byrd 
and  Ms. Reichert will alternate during the two days of the week with the direct supplemental instruction for 
the Title III After School program.  The number of sessions will remain the same. 
Teachers in the  program: 
Ms. Lolo Saney  Common Branch  (K-6) & Tesol ( K-12)

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
The program is scheduled to commence on November 1st 2018 for two days per week on Wednesdays & 
Thursdays. The After School program will end on Thursday May 30, 2019. 
Wednesdays & Thursdays: time 2:30-4:30 ( 2 hrs each day )Language of InstructionThe language of 
instruction is English with practical support and scaffolds in the native languages spoken at PS 017K, to the 
extent possible and as presented in our diverse population of MLLs. We usually buddy up students of 
different language skills to assist. 
number and types of certified teachers 
Our After school teaching is a co-teaching collaboration model between one content area teacher, and the 
ENL teacher.  The team will work together, and will be responsible to plan, and deliver supplementary 
differentiated instruction.  This team will collaborate to continuously ‘take the pulse of the class during the 
direct supplementary differentiated instruction, and adjusts instruction based on observation and data.  The 
ELLs with disabilities will be served as per their IEPs’ requirements.  There is a clear need for at least one 
content area teacher along with the ENL teacher.  One ENL teacher alone cannot successfully deliver 
remedial services to 19 plus students on one-on-one basis grade K-5.  The idea of smaller group is for the 
teacher to successfully  deliver the standard based remedial instruction on one-on-one basis.  Our students 
need the support and the only way to deliver a fair, equitable one-on-one instruction is when a teacher can 
afford to spend time with the children to make hard concepts ‘comprehensible.’Our two  content area 
teachers, hold general education certifications 1-6,  and they will collaborate with our ENL teacher, Ms. 
Saney.  Their in depth knowledge of CCSS, and knowledge of our ELLs in various grades as  their 
homeroom teacher or knowing the student in various categories makes each teacher a perfect match for 
delivery of remedial services and direct supplementary differentiated instruction.  We are a small school and 
teachers and students have a very positive and close relations at school. Students will receive Integrated ENL 
instruction from the ENL teacher,  and the content area teacher will deliver supplemental remedial instruction 
as they assist with concept development and making homework material comprehensible. 
Total number of sessions: 41 per one ENL teacher.  
Total number of sessions:: 41  per one general ed teacher either Ms. Cassandra Byrd or Ms. Margaret 
Reichert.

Rationale 
The rationale for our school’s professional development program for the Title III teacher as well 
as other teachers of ELLs responsible for delivery of instruction to ELLs is threefold, and with 
one overarching agenda: To provide staff development opportunities so that educators can: 
1. Develop deeper sensitivity and responsiveness to ELLs’ cultural, social, emotional, lingual 
and academic needs. 
2. Create, foster, and maintain a learning environment, which celebrates diversity as an asset and 
not to treat it as a disability, a deficiency nor a liability. To accomplish this objective, ELLs will 
be provided with meaningful and authentic educational experiences. 
3.  Use undiluted standard – based instruction for ELLs. Every effort is made to help ELLs 
overcome the “affective filters” that will prevent them from learning both the content and L2

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
To assess the early literacy of our ELLs at PS 17, Teachers of ELLs use multiple instruments as described below: 
  
MOSL Baseline; and ReadyGen Baseline Assessment, and other assessment tools as below: 
These data generally reveal that our ELLs are mostly reading below grade levels. This data is used to modify instruction for our 
ELLs in their homerooms while they receive the mandated minutes of instructional support by an ENL provider.  
  
  
2018:   Pending test results as of 9/6/18 
  
 
Kindergarten 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

Teachers of ELLs use ReadyGen, Performance Based Assessments,  Running Records, the  
“Beginning of the Year” Assessments (Baseline), and teachers' created materials. The rubric and the data gained from these 
assessments allow us to see the ELLs’ phonemic awareness, letter recognition, and 
comprehension. 
 
The data is also used for planning and programming as well as instructional modifications per need. 
  
First Grade 
Teachers of ELLs use Fountas & Pinell, TCRWP and Running Records, ReadyGen literacy assessments, TC reading level 
description, and MOSL.   
 
The running records provide the students' independent reading levels which is helpful in book selections for one-on-one as 
well as group guided instruction. The Running Records also provide information on student’s miscues with visuals, meaning, 
syntax, and which areas need more support to achieve fluency. 
 
The phonics assessment helps in monitoring  phonemic awareness. These data further inform our instructional planning by 
helping us to work together to come up with the target issues that we find in individuals and in groups. These data are crucial 
in planning the curriculum, designing assessments, and for individual/ group instruction. 
  
  
Second Grade 
Teachers of ELLs use  ReadyGen Phonics baseline assessments to measure student knowledge of phonemes, segmentation, 
blending of syllables, and also students' ability to discern rhyming words.  Another baseline reading assessment is also 
administered to determine reading ability, and comprehension at the beginning of second grade as well as measuring fluency, 
and phonemic awareness.  
 
Data further informs phonics remediation needs, reading remediation, and assessing needs for additional tools to support 
instruction of ELLs. 
 
 
Third Grade 
The teachers of ELLs use various assessments such as ReadyGen Performance Based Assessments,  MOSL, and teachers' 
created materials targeted towards each of the anchor texts from the ReadyGen units. The data provides a clear and specific 
understanding of what ELLs proficiency, and skills needed to be taught  The data will also inform  planning and programming to 
support ELLs in small groups for ELA, and Math.  
 
The Dolch site word check lists are also visited three times a year (at the beginning, middle and end) by 
self-contained third grade teachers to identify word knowledge. 
 
MOSL (Measure of Student Learning) assessments are used to determine ELLs’ growth.  The data provide insight into 
incremental progress even though still considered below grade level.  The data also showed that the ELLs still need major 
support in all ELA areas. The data is used in evaluating our supplemental programs to assist struggling ELLs.  
  
 Fourth Grade 
 
The teachers of ELLs use  ReadyGen (baseline assessments, fluency, unit assessments, and READY ELA Assessments.  The data 
provide current reading comprehension levels, and  identifies strength and weaknesses. 
 
  
 
Fifth Grade 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

The teachers of ELLs use Ed Performance Scantron test which is an online assessment tool.  Regular unit assessments are part 
of our school's wide ELA Program. The data provide a rough idea of student’s grade level reading ability as well as the 
student’s Lexile Measure, and students' struggles in comprehension.  The test compares the students to other students in the 
district.  One weakness of the test is its inaccuracy in measuring students' decoding and fluency abilities because all reading is 
done silently.  They data however provide a general sense about students' vocabulary knowledge.  
 Running Records, words per minute, DOE Benchmarks and reading selections from 4th grade End of Year to measure literacy 
skills are also used in fifth grade. These data have revealed improvements and progress in reading, and writing; some gain in 
spelling skills, formation of topic sentence with supporting detail sentences. To master making a complete sentence is still in 
progress, as children like to make phrases. More work needs to be done in basic sentence structure; sight words, and oral 
reading skills and fluency.  
 
 
 
The ReadyGEN End-of-Unit Assessments, MOSL, teachers' created assessments, and informal assessments are also used. The 
data show the areas of strength and weakness based on various components of literacy skills required by the CCSSI. The data 
also inform instruction for supplementary instructional services. 
  
 
  
 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Various collaborative measures, and teacher teams are formed in ELA, Social studies, Math, Science and Technology for 
teachers to collaborate , devise plans and take actions. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
  
 
• NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, and NYSESLAT is used to identify baseline, progress and areas of needs. 
  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

We are heavily investing in a general after school program Monday to Friday, as well as the ENL After School  to cater to the 
needs for remedial and one -on -one attention, and support. The professional activity period on Fridays is another opportunity 
for teachers to hep students exhibiting certain needs in any subject during school hours. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
  
As per CR Part 154: Commissioner’s Regulations of New York State that govern education and services for ELLs, for each 
English language learner who scores below specified levels of performance on the annual English language proficiency 
assessment,  our school determines the additional support services to provide the student, taking into consideration evidence 
such as the following: 
 
       􏰀  Number of years of instruction in the English as a new language program  
       􏰀  English and home language literacy  
       􏰀  Content area and social-emotional support needs of students with  inconsistent/interrupted  
                                     formal education (SIFE)  
       􏰀  English and home language literacy needs of our long-term ELLs, 
       􏰀  Results on the annual English language proficiency assessment exam

 The IEP for each child is reviewed, and referred to SBST.  In addition to that, TheENL Provider is invited to attend the IEP 
renewal meetings.The support services  will be aligned to any intervention plans (e.g., Academic Intervention Services) the 
school is already providing to all students.  Additionally, there will be scaffolding, curriculum modifications, and support for 
ELLs in place. 
  
• We serve our ELL-SWDs with ENL services as per mandated CR Part154.3 minutes of instruction, and as prescribed by their 
IEPs.  
  
• We highly differentiate instruction based on the theory of Multiple Intelligences, which accounts "for a broader range of 
potential in Children", allowing multiple points of entry, creativity and in general what jazzes children most. 
 
• Our ENL Provider consults with the classroom teachers of ELLs, introducing instructional materials, and discussing the 
children’s specific academic, social, and emotional needs to better and more holistically teach them.  
  
• As of 9/6/2018,  we have 22 ELLs-SWDs. 
 
 
STRATEGIES USED BY TEACHERS OF ELLs-SWDs 
• Lessons are presented using music, going on field trips, doing movement exercises, engaging in cooperative learning, and 
multimedia activities related to students' cultural, and social background.  Obviously there are scaffolds in place to cater to 
particular needs of each student student. 
• We also use schema building approach for academic literacy where ENL teacher of ELLs-SWDs directs ELLs to preview the 
text before the Read-Aloud or Shared Reading. The teacher walks through the pages noting titles, paragraphs, 
pictures/illustrations, and print literacy elements so that ELLs can start the reading task with a general sense and knowledge of 
print to preview the story as the teacher draws the students’ attention to a more in-dept analysis of the the text. 
  
• We use Shared Reading, and "I read first and you read next" strategies in addition to various ENL methodologies that are the 
central focus of the ENL program to support ELLs.  
  
• ELLs write about each book  they read  in the ENL classroom.  An informal assessment based on discussions, and checking for 
deep comprehension are administered during and after each reading activity.  This task is accomplished by asking students to 
summarize, repeat in own words, paraphrase, open ended question as well as closed ended questions, and just purely discuss 
the topic. The principals of Reciprocal Teaching is in place.

• Guided reading & writing; graphic organizers; modeling; small groups structured conversation; poem memorization; flash 
cards; spelling words incorporated into reading, and completing vocabulary logs (This task requires a comprehensive look at a 
word including researching on the Internet using on line dictionaries to discover definition, antonym, synonym, type of word, 
and etymology).  Each student then draws a picture of the word on the same vocabulary log to further cement the word in 
memory.  Circling unknown words in reading material; labeling classroom supplies/ objects in multiple languages; visual aids;

using colors to distinguish parts of speech in modeling writing; Read Aloud, and facilitated discussions; Think Aloud; Writing 
Prompts; and Foss Books in science are all used to further understanding. 
  
In 2017-18, the school's literacy and social studies curriculum's theme is  election. The ELLs along with all other students at PS 
017 study the United States Constitution, including the concept democracy and the structure of government. The Role of 
Media in election, polls and election culminating in a project which will be introduced by the principal and the social studies 
team. 
  
• To meet the diverse needs of our ELL-SWDs within the “least restrictive environment”, we are mindful of the ELL-SWDs' 
unique needs. We try to bridge the gap between our teaching styles and their learning styles by using various strategies, 
prompts and material as indicated above. We have teachers and paraprofessionals trained to serve ELLs with Disabilities in a 
caring environment conducive to learning.  
  
• ELL-SWDs are offered equal and appropriate access to all programs and activities at PS 017 . The ELL-SWDs are encouraged 
and assisted to have meaningful participation in all the activities along with their general education peers and other ELLs.  
 
A resource room (SETSS) is also available to ELL-SWDs in grades K-5.  At SETSS, we try to meet the ELLs’ IEP goals and or try to 
progress closer to achieving their goals. The SETSS teacher also reinforces classrooms’ teaching points to help ELL-SWDs with 
their unique needs in the “least restrictive environment” based on their academic, social, lingual, and cultural needs.   
  
• ELLs  who are considered “at risk” receive extra assistance during the school day, and also in our after school programs in 
ELA, and Math. 
  
• ELLs also receive supplementary instructional support during Title III ELL After School Program. 
  
• All instruction in these programs are in English with support in the second language as practical. 
  
  
  
  
  
  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
  
We generally use the EDAT results to evaluate our services and modify instruction as required. This year we will use it as asoon 
as we complete our intake process. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The ENL provider accesses EDAT analysis, and shares the data and analysis with the principal who in turn uses it to assign 
teachers  to help remedy the areas of needs, and offer or expand on enrichment programs.

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

 
"Pull -Out" heterogeneous model 
The ENL Provider  delivers pure ESL as well as integrated ESL services to  of ELLs since she is certified in both common 
branches and TESOL. 
  
Programming in our Freestanding Stand Alone ENL  is based on proficiency levels by grade. Some cases 
of  heterogeneous  mixed proficiency levels are seen where instructional differentiation is supported based on 
multiple entry points. Classes meet Monday through Friday for one period per grade level.   Our at-risk students 
receive extra help during our ENL Provider prep, as well as her professional activity periods on Fridays as she delivers 
differentiated instruction to bridge the gap. 
  
The groupings of ELLs is after the winter break for an test preparation for NYSESLAT 2018.  We have used Empire State 
NYSESLAT - ESL/ELL by embedding mini lessons as needed.  ELLs are administered all the NYS assessment tests that 
are required of general education students with test accommodation as required per their IEPs as applicable.  
  
Daily observations are systematically in progress to help monitor, and evaluate students' progress towards 
proficiency.

We ensure the delivery of the mandated minutes of instruction in our Integrated English as a new language (ENL— formerly 
English as a second language) by cross referencing NYSESLAT and NYSITELL results.   We are cognizant to deliver the correct 
number of minutes for each ELL depending on their level of proficiency. 
  
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
"Success in school depends upon the child's  mastery of cognitive/academic language, which is very different from the social 
language used at home. " 
  
The students in Freestanding Stand Alone ENL program are instructed in English - L2 with support in native language- L1 to the 
extent possible. We have a diverse group of English Language Learners in several classes. Diversity is celebrated to teach 
culture and language, and it is utilized as an instructional tool to effectively tap into a child's prior knowledge.

Instructional approaches and methods 
We use research based strategies, vocabulary development techniques in context, TPR,  language standards of the 
CommonCcore, scaffolding techniques, reciprocal teaching, all with modifying curriculum and provide support to develop 
language.  
 
The language of instruction is English.  Content  is made comprehensible  by incorporating the four skills of listening, speaking, 
reading, and writing in each class. The lessons in the ENL room are taught  thematically and the focus is on the basic skills 
needed to communicate in every day situations (BICS) as well as putting strong emphasis on acquiring the academic language 
(CALP). The ENL program is based on NYS ENL Standards and Performance Indicators, and is anchored to CCSSI for reading and 
writing. The Program is also aligned with the schools core curriculum and is a support system in place to increase academic 
performance for ELLs to meet or exceed expectations indicated by language literacy and proficiency standards. 
 
  
 
2017-18 ENL Program Goals 
I. Provide content based instruction, anchored in CCSSI considering ELLs' interests, and Jazzing them at different levels of 
language proficiency. 
II. Utilize ENL methodologies; including top-down, and bottom-up instructional strategies to differentiate, and scaffold for in-
depth learning, and acquisition of L2. 
III. Teach Disciplinary Literacy, and Incidental Vocabulary allowing multiple entry points. 
IV. Assist students to achieve grade level language literacy, and proficiency based on NYS ENL Standards, and Performance 
Indicators anchored to CCSSI. This goal will be accomplished by adopting various instructional techniques such as Modeling, 
Bridging, Contextualization,  Schema building, Text Re- presentation, Close Reading, Think Aloud, and Meta cognition. Students 
are required to monitor their own learning  by jotting down the day's learning in their logbook based on Blooms Taxonomy. 
V. Measure MOSL during, and after each class by close, direct observation. 
Also monitoring students' learning by various instruments such as formative, and summative assessments. Taking the pulse at 
all times for multiple points of entry is another measure to assess students' learning and diagnose the need for intervention. 
VI.  Teach and encourage children to assimilate, and acculturate by establishing norms for the  pragmatic language 
development in order to become successful members of the larger community of learners. The students will assume more 
responsibility for their own learning as they gain academic, and communicative competence in L2. 
VII. Practice Reciprocal Teaching more 
  
Projects & Activities 
To maximize English language acquisition, the ENL, and classroom teachers collaborate to deliver the elements of Balanced 
Literacy, math, and Phonics.  Our ENL provider integrates content-based instruction in science, math, and social studies to 
meet the individualized literacy needs of ELLs.  
  
Across levels, students will complete a variety of grade/level activities to demonstrate and reinforce knowledge of English k-5 
grade concepts. Students will be engaged in various authentic, academic discussions, and current affairs to negotiate meaning. 
Students will read, and write on various topics, and literary pieces. The ELLs will orally present their written work to receive 
constructive feedback from peers and the instructor. In analyzing literary pieces, the principals of Shared Inquiry method will 
be used to inspire deeper thinking through close reading, and conversation. 
  
Semantic activities are embedded in each lesson. Syntax modeling allows for rephrasing the sentences and phrases specifically 
expressed in Ebonics. The practice of morphology of new words; dissecting a word and its sounds are some of the activities 
that ELLs do.   Students will also incorporate grammar structures including noun, pronoun, verb, adjective, article, adverb, 
proposition, conjunction, and interjection as well as using linguistic devices in order to critically analyze, examine, discuss, and 
write about various themes throughout the year. Students will use various websites, watch videos and search on line for 
further exploration on topics of interest.

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   N/A 
  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

  
  
We differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups by using different materials, by grouping based on 
proficiency, buddy system, and offering enrichment program. ________ 
 
a.  SIFE 
• We analyze the data to identify the SIFEs’ needs and support them accordingly.  
• The SIFE student in grade 3 and above with interrupted formal education who are two years behind their peers will be 
provided with additional help through our after school programs. 
• We also use Peer-Buddy and Small Group Activities so that the SIFEs gradually warm up to the whole group discussions and 
class as they acquire necessary language skills to participate in larger groups and to feel safe to take intellectual risks.  
• In the ENL classroom, the SIFEs are encouraged to write their assignments in their native language if they wish, and use art to 
express their ideas in order to feel included in the class room activities and as they gradually acquire the English academic 
language. 
• Those identified as SIFE, will receive an individualized plan designed by the ENL Provider, for one on one instruction from the 
ENL teacher as needed, and shared with the classroom teachers of ELLs.  
• TPR (Total Physical Response), the Natural Approach methodologies, Cognitive Academic Language Learning, Whole 
Language Approach, and Retelling are  the approaches used to teach language based on the level of English proficiency for 
the  SIFE.  The instruction is adjusted as their English language skills are increased. 
 
b.  New Comer ELLs ( 0-3 Years) 
• This group of new comers may come with strong native skills.  We recognize the demands of newly arrived ELLs, and the 
longer-term ELLs  as quite different and when both types of ELLs are grouped together, a variety of scaffolding methods will be 
employed to ensure differentiation, and delivery of instruction allowing multiple entry points. 
• Specific strategies for each of the four language skills will be taught in small groups and based on each child's interest.  
• The newcomer ELLs will  use computers and various software to work on their listening skills specially targeting skills 
at  hearing the beginning, middle and the ending sounds.  
• The newcomers will use soft wares to help them decode sounds, and pronounce words as natives do. The Visual Graphic 
Organizers, Audio Visuals, Multicultural Resources, Alternative Assessment 
Instruments and other modified class work based on the level of English Proficiency are used as strategies to teach the 
Academic llanguage skills to newcomers.  
• For newcomer ELLs,  the instruction is focused on BICS ( basic interpersonal communicative skills ), so that they acquire the 
basics of the language in order to be able to communicate in school setting and be able to express their own needs and 
concerns.   
• We use TPR  and a Peer-Buddy system is in place for the newcomer ELLs to feel safe, happy and belonged in a low-anxiety, 
stress free learning environment.  
• As the newcomer ELLs acquire the language and as speech emerges; they will be taught more of CALP (cognitive academic 
language proficiency) by various instructional strategies. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

• The new comers are also provided with the Pearson book for beginners. 
• Newly arrived ELLs are encouraged to participate in after school programs where they can receive additional support, and 
help with home work along with enrichment program, and teaching language, and logical thinking and reasoning by learning 
how to play Chess.  Ms. Saney teaches chess to students in teh ENL room. 
In 2016-17 SY,  33  students learned much about the game of Chess rules,  used chess strategies, and had tremendous fun 
playing it. 
 
Features of our ENL Room 
• Newly installed Triumph Board 
• Talking prompts to response to text 
• A word wall and numbers 
• Strategy charts related to the current units of study 
• The chart flow of the day 
• Charts modeling the correct use of language 
•  A  leveled library 
• The ENL classroom library features books across a variety of genres and levels. This library includes 
   multicultural books and a selection of books in Spanish, Arabic and Polish.   
•  Each ELL will receive a copy of  a glossary in his/her native language.  One copy of all glossaries are in use in the 
   ENL room and students are taught how to use them. 
• In addition to ENL Library, the Robin Hood Library iat the school is open to all children including ELLs. There are great number 
of diverse books providing resources to satisfy the intellectual needs of the children. 
• Election word chart 
• Social Studies chart 
• There are listening centers, and  ELLs are are encouraged to use them to support their listening skills. 
• There are three computers with access to Internet that ELLs use for reaserch, reading and writing.  
• The ENL classroom will continue to feature a print-rich environment that supports the acquisition of L2 language.  
 
 
Developing The (4-6 Years) ELLs 
The ( 4-6 Years ) ELLs are striving hard, and are supported by a coherent plan of action that includes, rigorous academic 
intervention by the ENL program,  and in our after school programs. 
 
We look at the NYSESLAT results, to program a sustained, ongoing, and deliberately targeted action plan for the (4 to 6 years) 
ELLs, to prevent them from becoming Long Term ELLs.  
The goal for the (4 to 6 years) ELLs is to reach proficiency, and the following plan is in place to close that gap. 
 
In addition to receiving the ENL minutes mandated  as per CR  Part154,  we have a system in place that includes: 
• The ELLs are provided with additional help in the after school programs. 
• The instruction is consisted of focused instruction in reading and writing, targeting the area most needed for support. 
• The  ELLs  receive interventions in the areas of reading and math.  
• The ELLs  participate in the NYSESLAT test to acquire the skills needed to achieve proficiency in the 
 NYSESLAT 2018. 
  
  
d. Long -Term ELLs 6+ 
As pf 9/6/2017 we do not have any long-term ELLs, a plan is however in place for the Long-Term ELLs  to achieve proficiency in 
the modality in question, and test out of the program by taking the NYSESLAT as  achieved it in the past.  In order to meet that 
goal, the Long Term ELLs, along with all other ELLs will participate in the NYSESLAT test preparation to acquire the skills 
needed to successfully reach language proficiency. 
 
The differentiated instructional program for this group of Long-Term ELLs is generally geared towards their language 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

deficiencies assessed by NYSESLAT of the previous years , the ELA assessment results , teacher's observations, monitoring 
and  evaluation. 
• These group of ELLs generally need more focused instruction in reading and writing. We meet them where their needs are. 
• For the long-term ELLs, the ENL curriculum focuses on instruction to achieve mastery of reading and writing skills which is 
part of developing CALP (Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency). 
• The long-term ELLs will also receive additional support in the after school programs. 
• The long-term ELLs will also receive ENL instructional support as per the mandated minutes of ENL services as  per CR Part 
154.2. 
• A combination of AIS/classroom inquiry support is also offered to the long-term ELLs. 
  
  
e. Commanding Proficient ELLs 
• ELLs who achieve proficiency in the NYSESLAT are entitled to, and receive transitional ENL support for two years. A system is 
in place to provide services to these students at all grade levels.   
• Newly proficient students are serviced in a small group setting for 90 minutes per week of instruction which will be designed 
according to the student’s grade level,  and is entirely based on his/her academic interests and in compliance with our school's 
regulations. 
• The ENL teacher has always served some of the previous ELLs depending on demonstrated needs/interests even before this 
policy went into effect, so this mandated two year service is a great opportunity for enrichment . 
 • In 2015- 16 and 2016-17,  all ELLs who scored at Commanding Proficient in grades 3-5  received Project Based  Instruction.  
 
The project entailed research, and authoring a book on topics of interest.  Thus each student was researching what jazzed him/ 
her.  The students are required to have curiosity about their world, and find their interests. Then they are given ample time to 
think of a burning question  about that interest which in turn becomes their thesis question.  They  learn how to conduct 
research on that, and to learn about their held assumptions specifically by conducting academic research.  This is in 
preparation for high school, and ultimately higher education. Some of the students' topics of interest were, how volcanoes 
form?  Extinct animals in France, Race cars, Wright brothers. Its refreshing t mention that oin all the above cases, children's 
assumptions were proven otherwise. 
 
RESEARCH Cycle & Book formatting 
Walking into this research class, you will find students conducting research, collecting data, sorting data, collecting images, 
citing sources, and formatting the credit pages as well as the images they acquire from the Internet; and formatting those into 
MS documents.  It is a messy process but students learn and pick up new skills as they sharpen the old ones. They also learn 
how to use Microsoft, Adobe Photoshop as by-products of this intensive research based instruction. The following cycle is 
repeated for each topic and for each student. 
 
   STEP 1:  Identify and develop a topic 
   STEP 2: Use the Internet, find books, and articles 
   STEP 3: Find literature and research for background information 
   STEP 4: Use indexes to find periodicals 
   STEP 5: Evaluate what you find 
   STEP 6: Cite what you find, using a standard format 
   STEP 7: Editing & Revisions 
   STEP 8: Formatting and layout 
 
   Individual weekly conferences are held to keep track of students' independent research.

Learning in the Library is a literacy-focused after-school program for 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade students.  The students are 
identified by their classroom teachers.  The students are higher-performing,  and independent workers.  Each grade meets 
once a week.  This is another opportunity for students to work in small groups, strengthening their reading and writing skills.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
  
In the ENL room and beyond, ELL-SWDs will receive instruction using the following methods and materials both in their home 
rooms as well as in the ENL room.  Additionally, ELLs - SWDs have full access to the school library that has books and resources 
in several languages. ELL- SWDs also participate in the government unit that is being done on elections. 
  
• Lessons are presented in various ways such as using music, dance and movement, field trips, cooperative learning and 
multimedia related to a student's cultural and social background. 
• We also use schema building approach for academic literacy where ENL teacher of ELL- SWDs directs ELLs to preview the text 
before the Read-Aloud or Shared Reading. The teacher walks through the pages noting titles, paragraphs, pictures/illustrations 
so that ELLs can start the reading task with a general sense and feel about the story as the teacher draws the students’ 
attention to a more in dept analysis of the book.  
• Shared reading and chorus reading using various ENL methodologies are the central focus of the ENL program.  
• ELLs write about each book that they read. An informal assessment and check for comprehension are administered during 
and after each reading.   
• Pearson Scott Foresman  ReadyGen- Pearson; Time For Kids; Weekly Reader; Passport to Social Studies; using 
 maps for directions; Developing Reading Fluency by Trish Callella- Creative Teaching Press; Coffin On A Case by Eve Bunting for 
developing reading and writing skills are some resources that are also used. 
• Guided reading & writing;  graphic organizers; modeling; small groups structured conversation; poem memorization; flash 
cards; spelling words incorporated into reading; conferencing; circling unknown words in reading material; labeling classroom 
supplies/ objects in English and other native languages present in our school now; visual aids; using colors to distinguish parts 
of speech in modeling writing;  Read Aloud, and facilitated  
discussions; Think Aloud; Writing Prompts;  and Reciprocal Teaching Principals are employed. 
  
We also employ the following Instructional Strategies for our ELLs-SWDs to provide access to academic content areas and 
accelerate English Language Development in grades K-2  in addition to the above. 
  
• Visuals  • Charts• Pictures • Peer Tutoring • Small group work • Computer programs (pebble go, starfall, pbskids) • One on 
One assistance • Songs • Poems (finger play) • Flashcards • Manipulatives • ReadyGen Phonics program • Scaffolds • TPR • 
Team teaching • Effective use of para professionals, and other adults to facilitate cooperative learning and front loading 
vocabulary are other means to facilitate learning. 
  
Our teachers of ELLs- SWDs use the following grade level materials and provide access to academic content areas to foster/ 
accelerate  English Language Development. 
  
       ReadyGen Literacy (Reading and Writing as well as Science and Social Studies): 50%Fiction and 50% 
       Non- Fiction; GoMath Mathematics curriculum Handwriting without tears  
  
  
We also use a program called REWARDS. This program is designed to improve reading fluency, decoding of multi-syllabic 
words, and academic vocabulary.  Most of the special education population in our school lack the independent reading skills 
that allow a student to excel in reading. This program has worked very well in the last two years. In addition to this program 
that our fifth grade self contained classroom uses, the teachers of ELLs modify the reading program to best fit the ELLs needs 
Most of the chapter books that we read for ReadyGen require advanced reading skills that need to be modified to help 
students.

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
  
  
Flexible scheduling is used to enable and support ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals, and to acquire/ attain English proficiency 
within the least restrictive environment. 
• Once a need is identified, the ELLs are encouraged to do their assignment and write in their native language as they are 
acquiring English.   
• ELLs with IEPs are served as per their IEP.  They are engaged in a rigorous curriculum along with their general education 
peers, and  participate in every school activity designed to accelerate learning. 
• ELLs who are considered “at risk” receive extra assistance during the school day from the grade-level teachers in ELA, Math, 
Science, and Social Studies. 
• several  ELLs with IEP have been receiving extra help from the ENL Provider. They usually are provided with a  system and will 
be  taught procedural lessons to learn how to be organized. 
• ELLs are also provided extra help during after-school, Title III program.  
• All instruction in these programs are in English and we complement the program by using the curriculum material noted 
above. 
• To meet our ELL-SWDs' diverse needs within the “least restrictive environment” we work hard to be mindful of the ELL-SWDs 
unique needs. We try to bridge the gap between our teaching styles and their learning styles by using various strategies, 
prompts and material as indicated above.  We have teachers and paraprofessionals trained to serve ELLs with disabilities in a 
caring environment conducive to learning.  
• Our ELL-SWDs are offered equal and appropriate access to all programs and activities at PS 17 to achieve grade level 
standards. The ELL-SWDs are encouraged and assisted to have meaningful participation in all the activities along with all their 
peers and other ELLs.   
• A resource room ( SETSS) is also available to our ELL-SWDs in grades 1-5.  At SETSS, we try to meet the ELLs’ IEP goals, and or 
try to progress closer to achieving their goals. The SETSS teachers also reinforce classrooms’ teaching  points to help ELL-SWDs 
with their unique needs in the “least restrictive environment” based on their academic, social, lingual, and cultural needs.   
• The use of the students’ native language to support second language acquisition is an invaluable tool to help in creating a 
warm, and caring learning environment.  Although 100% of instruction takes place in English in the ENL Program, efforts are 
made to use the students’ native language to support them. 
• Native language support is especially critical for newly arrived ELLs, thus Peer-Buddy and peer tutoring are encouraged and 
used as immediate supportive tools for the newly arrived ELLs. 
• There are several teachers who speak Spanish. The ENL provider is familiar with Bakhtiary, Turkish,  and Kurdish languages. 
She is also literate in French and Arabic, with Commanding Proficiency in Persian. 
• We use glossaries in the children's native language to help make the academic content more comprehensible.  
• In the ENL classroom, diversity is highly celebrated, and is utilized as a valuable tool to make children feel special and unique 
while they collaboratively learn in diverse settings.  Diversity is also a valuable tool to teach cultural and global awareness and 
values.  
• We help children acculturate in a smooth transitional journey from their native culture/language into the English world 
assimilating with their peers in their new home.  
• In addition, there are books in various languages in the ENL library as well as the Robin Hood Library that children use to 
expand their learning and widen their horizons.  
• ELLs also participate in the government unit that is being done on elections.   
  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Library services, ENL supplementary services, and extra help are offered in English with support in native language as the need 
arise.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

  
• ELLs  who are considered “at risk” receive extra assistance during the school day in ELA, Math, Science, and Social Studies . 
• ELLs receive extra help during  the ENL Provider's prep time as need arises. 
• ELLs are also provided extra help during  Title III ELL Plan after school program and other after school program the school will 
be offing Monday- Friday.  
•  All teachers of ELLs will also be using their Friday Professional period to help work with students on one - on - one basis to 
target and intervene. 
  
  
 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

The  following programs  were added in 2014-2015, and we observed that students were truly lifted. We hope these additions 
will provide enjoyment and also Kinesthetic Learning opportunities and ways of expressing artistic, and musical talents. 
  
The ELLs participated this spring in the CASA and WMAAC programs along with all other students in their respected grades. 
 
There is going to be a Monday- Friday After School Program for 2018-19. 
  
  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

  
  
  
Npt Applicable. 
  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
  
In general, ELLs participate in all activities along with other general education mainstream students.   
• All ELLs are encouraged and supported to participate in all school activities.  
• All ELLs along with their general education peers are encouraged to benefit from library resources.  
• ELLs have full access to the computer lab  along with mainstream students engage in various activities using computers to do 
projects and write up reports, letters, etc. They are learning various skills in using computers.  
• The ELLs are also entitled to test accommodation, and additional intervention support as needed. 
• Most ELLs usually enroll in Title III ELL Plan After School. 
  
Ells who are entitled to attend our after school program designed to assist with homework and delivery of remedial 
instructions.  The after school program will meet two times per week, on Wednesdays,  and Thursdays. It is a support system 
to help ELLs with their homeworks and computer literacy. 
 
All parents of ELLs and all parents in general receive literature in forms of fliers, and notes sent by the school to inform them of 
any new program that is being offered to the who school population. 
   
   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

 
In our ENL program there is a Buddy system in place to be utilized as needed.  
 
When there is only one child speaking  a certain language, we use Google translate as a tool as well as other means such as art 
and technology to communicate.  In 2014-15 this worked just so well with one Swedish speaking child.  Google translate and 
other ELLs supported several students  to integrate smoothly, and happily into our ENL program. 
  
At the beginning of the year, glossaries in all languages are be printed from DOE site. We will provide each child with one copy 
in addition to sending one copy home and several copies will be available in the ENL room. The students will be taught formally 
how to use the glossaries on continuous basis and not only during tests. 
  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

  
ELLs will continue to be instructed fully across a variety of genres based on age and grade appropriateness. Instructional 
strategies and methodologies are also based on the ELLs'   proficiency level.  The ELLs also receive all their mandated minutes 
of instruction, have full access to all resources available to our general population and receive services in an equitable 
manner.  The needs are first identified and the services are provided accordingly.  This is all ensured through precise planning

and scheduling by the ENL Provide,r and approved by the principal. 
 
• ELLs  participate in the ELL After School Programs.  
• ELLs also actively participate in all test preparation programs in the after school program when they are offered to all 
students.  
• ELLs along with general Education students attend the library during school hours for open access, and circulation.  
• ELLs also watch videos related to the their area of study.  
• ELLs participate in every project and program that general education students are participating in. 
• Ells go on to Field Trips to theaters, museums, farms, and in general fully participate in all programs offered to the general 
population. 
 
  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
 
Our school and MS 577 share the building. The two principals do collaborate and put the building and its facilities to its 
maximum use.  The ELLs also participate and use resources in the yard, cafeteria, and  at the library. Our ELLs along with all our 
student population go to see  performances offered by MS 577 if and when they are invited. 
 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
  
• As our school is closed for the summer, we could not provide individual orientation at the time of registration in the 
summer.  In the month of June however ,we provided orientation on individual basis for  active and pre registered 
kindergarten ELLs. 
But all ELLs are welcomed, and greeted daily. Paraprofessionals, staff, parent coordinator, and teachers who speak other 
languages will of course use the parents' preferred language to communicate in greeting children especially on the first day of 
school.  
  
We will have our family night this year on September 13 when all parents  including parents of ELLs are invited/ and 
encouraged to attend. 
  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

  
Not Applicable. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Not Applicable.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
  
The professional development design to support our K – 5  ELL Program model, is comprehensive and builds the professional 
capacity of teachers to ensure the academic achievement of English Language Learners. The professional development 
program is based on the premises of reflective practice. Teachers and instructional leaders are given opportunities to 
  
• Have information on content and its classroom application 
• Have time to construct knowledge and understanding of the new information 
• Have time to implement, practice, and assess the newly learned information 
•  Have time and opportunities to share and reflect on their newly acquired knowledge 
• Realign, restructure, and practice based on their reflection and professional sharing. 
  
Professional Development sessions will focus on supporting teachers of English Language Learners in their understanding of 
scaffolding instructions for ELLs aligned to the Common Core and learning research-based instructional strategies for 
developing content and language with ELL students.  In addition, we will focus on instructional strategies in literacy that 
support language acquisition.  We will use the newly issued resources from NYSED for literacy and mathematics, “Scaffolding 
Instruction for English Language Learners: Resource Guides for English Language Arts and Mathematics”. 
  
Some examples for professional development activities include: Scaffolding Instruction for ELLs. 
  
Our PD plan for all ESL/bilingual teachers and classroom/content-area teachers  is to support ELLs in the development of 
academic language and the delivery of instruction using ESL methodologies to scaffold understanding. Our PD plan also 
includes non-pedagogical staff, such as secretaries.   
  
Additionally, DELLSS offers many opportunities for teachers to attend intensive institutes where they can learn directly from 
national and in-house experts on how they can begin to make significant changes to their instructional practices for 
ELLs.  Online videos as a supplemental form of professional development to reach the thousands of teachers responsible for 
ensuring ELLs develop into successful learners in their classrooms are also used. For example, a video series on Response to 
Intervention was created and posted to support educators on effective strategies for implementing RTI with ELLs.   
  
The school also has in place the contractual Monday PDs when all teachers including the teachers of ELLs are required to 
attend. The paper work, agendas and attendance sheets are kept in the general office, and copies are also kept by each 
teacher individually.   Collaborative teams  are formed in ELA, Math, Science, Social Studies, Communication and Special 
Education. Team members will complete various tasks to create plans of action that will be implemented by all. Teams also 
propose strategies, materials and plans for 2018-2019 SY and share best practices.   
  
All PDs, those attended by the school secretary,  teachers of ELLs and classroom/content-area teachers  as well as our ENL 
Provider are to support ELLs in the development of academic language and the delivery of instruction using ESL methodologies 
to scaffold understanding. 
  
• In 2018-19 several PDs will be provided by Dr. Marchi ,and all teachers including teachers of ELLs have been and will be in 
attendance.  Agenda and attendances are kept in general office. Additionally each teacher saves a copy of agendas in their 
personal files. 
  
• PDs will be  provided on Danielson Framework. All teachers who are members of various Professional development  teams 
in  (ELA Team, Science Team, Math Team Communications Team, and Special Education Team) are required to attend.  
• Also a PD on DOE Expectations & COMMON CORE SATE STANDARDS for 2018-19  will be  given by Dr. Marchi in September, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

 

and all teachers of ELLs are required to attend. 
• The teachers of ELLs are also provided opportunities during several professional development sessions and Election Day 
to  demonstrate/ model age and grade appropriate instructional strategies and methodologies to the classroom / cluster 
teaching staff.   
• We will also use the Title III funds for per session of PD hours for teachers of ELLs .  
• Records for attendance to meet the requirement will be maintained and kept n the general office. 
  
  
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 
  
  
We meet the  professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2 of 15% of total hours for all teachers and 50% of 
total hours for our ENL teacher to receive ELL - specific professional development . We provide professional development to all 
teachers and administrators that specifically addresses the needs of English language learners. A minimum of fifteen percent 
(15%) of  the required professional development hours for all teachers prescribed by CR Part 80 must be dedicated to language 
acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for 
English language learners. For all bilingual and English as a new language teachers, a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the 
required professional development hours must be dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with core content area 
instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for 
English language learners. Records are kept in the general office by the secretary and each teacher  keeps her/his own copy.  
  
Ms. Saney, our ENL Provider attends PDs that are essentially more than (50%) of the required professional development hours 
and are dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices 
for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English language learners.  Ms. Saney an NYU 
alumni, also a member of NYU ELL Think Tank  uses personal time to attend those meetings. These meetings at NYU RBERN are 
most important as the latest policy changes and innovative instructional strategies are discussed.  She also attends several PDs 
offered by DOE as needed to complete all compliance issues as an Sole ENL Provider duties require.  
  
  
  
  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
  
We plan to use the contractual time on Tuesdays which is designated as the parent time to schedule meetings with each 
parent of ELLs. We will document these meeting along with information that will be provided to parents about their child's 
language development, participation and need in content areas. These  annual ELL Parental meetings are in addition to parent 
teacher conferences, and all other individual meetings /contact between school and parents.   The ENL Provider will keep 
records/ logs and copies of letters that are sent home to ensure each parent has  been informed of this policy for annual 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

 

 

individual meetings with ELL parents and any other pertinent information.  In the past two years I have understood that it is 
extremely difficult for most parents to attend these individual meetings in addition to all other parent teacher conferences 
they take part in. 
  
Our second option will be to make telephone calls to parents if they cannot come to school and discuss all matters pertaining 
to their child's education, and specifically language development and all aspects of it . We will keep logs of these 
conversations. We have prepared a list including but not limited to discuss the following concerns about each ELL student at 
the Annual ELL Parents' meeting. 
  
1. Discuss the goals of the program and expectations.  
2. Discuss the child’s language development progress, include literacy and numeracy transfer, and strategies to strengthen 
home language. Discuss activities to encourage oracy. 
3. Discuss the child’s English language proficiency assessment results.  
4. Discuss the child’s language development needs in all content areas.  
5. Discuss various activities parents and children can do for language development 
6. Conferences, activities, NYC resources,  If in person or telephone conversation are not feasible for the parent,  we will then 
write to the parent informing them of the progress of their child's language acquisition and we will certify mail the 
correspondence.  When in need we will use language services of NYC Department of Education’s Translation & Interpretation 
Unit by contacting them at Tel: 718.752.7373   -   E-mail: translations@schools.nyc.gov 
http://intranet.nycboe.net/translation_interpretation 
  
Additionally,  Ms. Saney has designed a form specific for the annual ELL parent meeting to discuss certain concerns. In addition 
to that, other discussion and concerns of the parent on that day will be documented/ signed by the parent and kept in the ENL 
room. 
  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

  
Through the efforts of the principal, teachers,  parent coordinator,  all staff, and the ENL Provider at PS 17; parents of ELLs are 
actively involved in all school activities open to the rest of the school community. 
 
 
• We will offer several parents’ meetings ( PDs) to inform parents of ELLs of their rights, DOE resources, how to navigate for 
info, other PDs held by universities for the parents of ELLs and more interesting subjects to appeal to them. 
 
• Translation services : Our school is subscribed to eChalk website that translates all our communications into 37 languages. 
• The ENL Provider reaches out and provides information on multiple ways parents can model and encourage great 
literacy/numeracy habits at home.  
• Also, throughout the year,  the ENL Provider keeps a close contact with the parents of ELLs, informing them of the children’s 
progress or any concern that they might have with the child’s progress or lack of it.  
• Parent Teacher Conferences are the other opportunities when parents visit and find out about their children’s progress or 
lack of it.   
• Parents are also given tools and information about the latest research on reading to their children in their native language 
and the research based findings of transference of literacy/ numeracy skills across languages.  
• Parents are given specific training to work with their children. 
• There are always several postings of the latest research material with regards to ELL's and second language 
learning/acquisition  near by the ENL room and in the hallways to inform all ELL parents and ELL stake holders

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Robert Marchi, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards

their concerns and cares.  
Parents are encouraged to complete various surveys . Parents regularly and informally meet with parent coordinator, 
ENL Sole Provider /LAC outside of school, on the train, in school, at dismissal, and at drop off times. Parents of ELLs 
usually chat with teachers, staff and administrators during these times as well. If there is any concern that parents 
have, that is always met with utmost care and diligence in the office.  
Also all concerns of parents are discussed during parent teacher conferences, curriculum night and during the annual 
ELL parent meetings. Issues are noted and addressed on spot if possible. Notes and logs for these meetings are kept in 
the ENL room.
