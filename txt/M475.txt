Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Stuyvesant High School’s mission is to provide students with a rigorous curriculum that nurtures 
and rewards their intellectual curiosity. Although Stuyvesant is historically recognized for its 
strengths in math, science, and technology instruction, the school also has a dynamic and diverse 
humanities program, as well as unique educational opportunities outside the classroom. Stuyvesant students take a 
core curriculum of four years of math, science, social studies and English, three years of world language, a term of 
computer science, a term of drafting, three terms of engineering/technology, swimming and art appreciation/history. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

The mission is to provide comprehensive and complex learning experiences to prepare students who are global 
citizens with proficiency and expertise across disciplines.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Stuyvesant High School has been a symbol of excellence in education for over a century. 

 

Known for its rigorous and accelerated math and science program, Stuyvesant is also rich in humanities and the arts. 
Electives and AP courses allow students to study a wide range of topics. Stuyvesant students routinely win state and 
national competitions not just in math and science, but also in speech and debate, creative writing, and sports.  

In addition to their basic math, science, English, history, foreign language, and other requirements, Stuyvesant 
students can apply for more than 60 electives, including Intel research classes, economics, psychology, software 
development, medical ethics, vertebrate zoology, western political thought, Jewish history, and the mathematics of 
sports (MIT course). Newly added courses include quantum mathematics, artificial intelligence, animal behavior, and 
engineering design.  

We are proud of the student-run organizations, publications, clubs, and teams that enrich the school’s vibrant 
learning environment. No matter where a student’s interests or talents lie, there will be a group of enthusiastic peers 
who share the same focus. These experiences greatly benefit our students as they thrive in this bustling, incredibly 
rich & supportive environment.  

Students play a strong role in organizing and managing these extra-curricular organizations, including our award-
winning Math Team, Science Olympiad, Model UN, Speech and Debate, and Robotics Teams, along with our 41 PSAL 
sports teams. Talented student musicians pack our 12 instrumental musical groups, from the small jazz combo to the 
symphonic band and choruses. Recently we've added a madrigal choir, a guitar class are developing an A.I. music 
course. Over a third of our students belong to one of our musical ensembles. Students engage in community service, 
computer science, sports, the environment, cooking, photography, and so much more. Each spring, hundreds of 
students participate in music and art performances, culminating in an entirely student-run, school-wide original 
musical theater extravaganza called SING! 

Stuyvesant also offers an Regeneron research elective that helps students prepare for intensive research science 
competitions. Thirty-one Advanced Placement courses are offered at Stuyvesant. In addition, we offer honors, post-
AP, and off-campus college level courses.  

In 2017-2018, approximately 3300 are enrolled in our school. Of the 826 students in class of 2018, more than 99% 
graduated on time and more than 95% of them earned a special diploma endorsed by Stuyvesant High School. The 
following are the average scores on various SAT exams: 

Evidenced Based Reading and Writing: 723 Mathematics: 775  
English Literature: 685 

U.S. History: 710 World History: 672 Math I: 706 Math II: 766 

Biology E: 715 Biology M: 737 Chemistry: 722 Physics: 720 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Virtually all of our graduates continue their education in 4-year colleges and many attend nationally and 
internationally known colleges and universities.  

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The AP, PPS has worked with the clinical social worker, to address the needs of our growing student body who are on 
the Autism Spectrum. These students are in need of improving their social skills, so they have created and 
implemented a social skills group that meets once a week. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

During the 2017-2018 school year, the Danielson Framework for Teaching was used to evaluate measures of teacher 
practice for the first time. Based on the observations made throughout the school year, our school identified 
additional areas of growth that reflect the school-wide instructional focus that best meets the needs of our school 
community during the school year 2018-2019. These areas include:  

1. Knowledge of Students to differentiate instructional and guidance supports 

2. Develop Coherent Lesson Plans that align to instruction 

3. Develop activities that demonstrate intellectual engagement in the classroom 

4. Check for understanding by using formative assessment strategies 

We believe that these areas, defined by Danielson rubric 1e, 3b, 3c and 3d, allow the school to create and refine 
strategic plans that best support our students.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
● Our curricula are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards or specific content standards such as Advanced 
Placement (AP) and our academic tasks emphasize rigorous habits and higher order thinking skills. In school year 
2017-2018, we offered over 31 Advanced Placement courses and 10 post-AP courses. In 2018, 1,563 students took at 
least one AP exam and 2,957 AP exams were administered. Of those who took at least one AP exam, 98% of the 
students received scores of 3 or higher. In the past three years, all Regents exams have had nearly 100% pass rate. 

● Curricular decisions result in embedded rigorous habits, creating coherence within courses and subject areas 
promoting college readiness for all students. 

● While school and class assessments provide feedback to students and teachers regarding student achievement, the 
wide range of individual teacher grading policies and practices limits the quality of actionable feedback to students. 

● Though instruction across classrooms evidenced strategies used to ensure students are engaged in rigorous tasks 
and higher order thinking skills, in some classes the opportunities for students to demonstrate these skills were 
limited. The cabinet has begun to meet every other week to share ways that they support cohering instructional foci 
within departments via feedback and observation reports. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
97% or more of students graduating in June 2019 will have taken at one or more Advanced Placement (AP) or other 
advanced course, and 75% or more will have taken three or more AP or other advanced courses.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 
Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Every assistant principal of supervision will work with teachers in 
his/her department to assure that curriculum for all AP courses is 
aligned with college board curriculum and the instruction 
delivered provides the rigor needed for high level student 
achievement. 

Assistant principal will monitor the implementation of the 
departmental policy through observing classes and working with 
the teachers.  

The AP of Guidance will work with the school counselors to 
ensure that all students have conversations about course 
selection choices and are provided supports in the selection of 
rigorous AP and advanced classes. 

The Cabinet will review all AP and advance courses, their 
eligibility criteria and the program capacity of the school to 
maximize offerings available to students.

● Stuyvesant is the largest high school in Manhattan. Our students travel from all five boroughs and matriculate to us 
from all manner of middle school. In order to better support the incoming students' transition to Stuyvesant, the 
school counseling department created a Freshman Seminar curriculum, which the students receive every other week 
as a class. The identified areas of for the Fall semester include Time Management, Organizational Skills, Self-Care, and 
more. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the

and Time-bound. 
All freshmen in the 2018-2019 school year will attend at least 95% of the freshman seminar course and the freshman 
seminar course will occur at least 10 times during the 2018-2019 school year. Through end of year surveys, 85% of 
participating 9th graders will state they found the 9th grade workshops helpful in their transition to Stuyvesant High 
School.

While there is not a monetary cost with this program, we are utilizing the resource of time. Primarily, the push-in to 
the classrooms. The period the freshman are presented to was previously used as a "bonus" time for the biology 
department, when the students were neither in lab nor physical education class. Secondly, the counselors are 
devoting time in the creation of these presentations and the implementation in the classroom.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The most recent Quality Review findings identified teacher collaboration as an area in need of improvement. 
Teachers are engaged in structured professional collaborations that promote the implementation of school goals and 
the Common Core instructional shifts. Teachers meet in four cohorts on bi-monthy Wednesday cross-disciplinary 
instructional meetings, and they meet monthly in department meetings where they collaborate horizontally within 
their department colleagues. Teacher teams consistently analyze student work for students enrolled in the shared 
course or for whom they are focused. 
More professional collaboration on teams can help strengthening the instructional capacity of teachers resulting in 
improved and shared practices. 
Although the school uses a creative model to provide all teachers with the opportunity to participate in school-wide 
professional development and teacher teams, school’s complex scheduling structure creates a great deal of difficulty 
for teachers to collaborate during their regular work hours.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
Teachers will participate in professional development learning opportunities that are both school-sponsored and offered 
by appropriate outside organizations, and collaborate with teachers in and outside the building. 

As a result, at least 75% of teachers will agree or strongly agree that they had opportunities to work productively with 
teachers from other schools on professional development as evidenced by the 2018-2019 NYC School Survey. Currently 
41% of teachers felt they had such opportunities.

teachers serve as facilitators during the professional development sessions. They are also funded to attend external 
professional development activities. The principal meets weekly with the administrative cabinet, bi-weekly with the 
instructional cabinet, weekly with the entire school leadership committee cabinet and facilitates Wednesday 
instructional meetings. The topics for these meeting were determined by teacher feedback using a google survey to 
all teachers.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

This is the third year as principal for the current school leader. The last two years specific instructional foci were 
introduced school wide and agree as shared areas for instructional work. The principal implemented a Monday 
leadership strand where AP's share best practices and use protocols to provide each other with feedback. This format 
is new to the administrative team and has been supported across all departments at subsequent department 
meetings. Department meeting agendas and notes, as well as new teacher and school wide PD plans will show 
evidence of learning cycles in support of the four foci. There is greater coherence between departments and overall a 
clear expectation has been articulated by the school principal.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
All teachers will participate in monthly whole department meetings focusing on instructional initiatives, and all teachers 
will meet monthly for small group professional development with the principal to work on lesson plan development and 
discuss instructional foci. As a result, at least 80% of the classrooms observed will demonstrate evidence of instructional 
foci by June 2019 as evidenced by teacher observations.

Our counselors regularly meet with students flagged as living in temporary housing in order to check in on their 
personal needs. Historically, the most commonly requested items are school supplies such as: book bags, writing 
utensils, computers, notebooks, etc. Such supplies are assigned to those specific students and not made available for 
general school use. 

 

3. Some Non-Title I schools receive a specific allocation based on the reported number of students living in temporary 
housing.  If your school received an allocation (please refer to the current Title I Funds Summary of School Allocation 
Memorandum), include the amount your school received in this question.  If your school did not receive an allocation 
and needs assistance in identifying resources to assist STH students, please contact an STH liaison.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Stuyvesant High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of 
the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Admission to our school is based on the score attained on the Specialized High School Admissions Test. Students who are 
identified as English Language learners are interviewed and their NYS Assessment, LAB-R, NYSSLAT, and other performance 
data are analyzed to help program the students. If the Home Language Identification Survey indicates a student's home 
language is not English and the student has not been tested for his/her English proficiency, the NYSITELL will be administered 
during the first week of school. Historically, the low percentage of English Language Learners has not affected the school-wide 
instructional plan.       
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Class tests, written work, participation in discussions, report card grades, and ELA Regents scores as well as the English AP 
exam are used to evaluate the success of English Language Learners.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Students needing ELL services will be programmed for social studies classes taught specifically by someone with an ESL license. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
No patterns are revealed due to a very small number of English Language Learners.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 
Services are coordinated through the World Languages department and the guidance department. Needs will then be 
communicated to the chair of the Social Studies department, which supervises the school's ESL teacher. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Students are programmed for social studies classes with an ESL teacher, giving them 200 minutes per week. Students 
who need more than 200 minutes of services will also be offered an integrated model.    

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Students are programmed based on their level of proficiency indicated on their NYSESLAT or NYSITELL. Few students, if any, 
need intensive services. Admission to this school is screened through challenging English and math entrance exams. 
Consequently, few students are ever admitted who need extensive ELL services. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Content areas deliver instruction aligned to the Common Core State Standards. Instructional framework includes explicit 
instruction, modeling, coaching, scaffolding, group discussion, problem solving, flexible grouping, and practice. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

English Language Learners are evaluated by staff members who are proficient in their native language. If no staff member is 
available for a specific language, outside resources will be used. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Content areas deliver instruction aligned to the Common Core State Standards. Instructional framework includes explicit 
instruction, modeling, coaching, scaffolding, group discussion, problem solving, flexible grouping, and practice. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Content areas deliver instruction aligned to the Common Core State Standards. Instructional framework includes explicit 
instruction, modeling, coaching, scaffolding, group discussion, problem solving, flexible grouping, and practice. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
N/A 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
We do not have targeted intervention programs for ELLs in the content areas. Our English Language Learners can receive ESL 
support during their mandated service time and/or AIS intervention program for all students. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

None 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We had none. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are offered equal access to all school programs and resources. After school and supplemental services are offered to all 
students including ELLs.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Instructional materials such as textbooks, novels, non-fiction reading materials, newspapers, and magazines, both hard copies 
and electronic versions, are used to support ELLs. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language support is provided informally by staff members who are proficient in a specific language. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Mandated support services and resources are appropriate for 9th grade ELLs. Historically all ELLs have tested out ELL before 
the end of their first year. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Instructional materials such as textbooks, novels, non-fiction reading materials, newspapers, and magazines, both hard copies 
and electronic versions, are used to support ELLs. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Eric Contreras, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The Parent Coordinator and the Program Office determined the exact number and percentage of parents who are 
listed as having a home language other than English. The three highest totals were for Chinese, Bengali, and 
Korean – speaking parents. As of October, 2017, 39% listed Chinese as their home language, 8% listed Bengali, and 
4.7% listed Korean. In addition, several years ago, the Parent Coordinator and the Parents Association leadership 
have consulted with the PA Ethnic Outreach Committees to discuss and establish procedures and policies to meet 
the needs of Limited- English Proficiency parents.  

These committees have concluded that all school-to-parent communications should be translated into Chinese 
whenever possible. Discussions with other parent ethnic groups, such as Bengali and Koreani, have also been 
conducted. Although there is a significant number (270) of families who list Bengali as their home language, a 
large majority of these parents report speaking and writing in English as well, and therefore did not require 
translation services.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

Based on the previous outreach, both the Parents’ Association and school staff have agreed that neither written 
translation, nor oral interpretation is necessary for these latter groups. In conjunction with the Parents’ 
Association, we have determined that written and oral translation of school-to-parent communication should only 
be provided in Chinese. This policy is explained to parents at all relevant Parent meetings and events, including 
Orientation for freshman parents, monthly PA meetings, and general parent events organized by the school.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.
