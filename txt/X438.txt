Section 2: Executive Summary and Organizing Principles 

 
The Objective 
The intent of this Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) is to continue to frame a three-year process 
for each Renewal school and design a comprehensive plan that outlines a strategic path to a paradigm shift in each 
school at every level. The motivation driving this work is our commitment to providing every child with a school that 
meets their academic and social-emotional needs. Closely accompanying this imperative is our belief that every school 
can be renewed and foster a community based culture of learning. The job of the district is to use our position to 
provide the systemic vision, strategies, and resources to facilitate school renewal through a collaborative effort including 
all stakeholders.  
 
The core values held as essential for the success of the School Renewal Program: 

  A “learning stance” must be held by all community members (district leaders, school leaders, school staff, 

community-based partners, students and families). The work should be approached with humility and integrity. 
We must all be willing learners. 

  A “theory of action” must guide the work to ensure clarity and coherence. 
  Authentic teams that collaborate in the spirit of trust, within and across the various levels of the school 

community, are prerequisites for successful school renewal 

  Schools will be places of robust engagement, anchored in positive youth development, ensuring that the school 

environment is welcoming and empowering for students, families and community members. 

  Strong professional development/learning is a fundamental part of our work. 
  The school renewal implementation must be simultaneously dynamic and responsive as well as sustained over 

the three year period of renewal. 

 
The organizing Theory of Action that guides the School Renewal Program strategy: 

By using the Six Elements of the Framework for Great schools as our improvement structure, we seek to align 
instructional coaching and leadership development with structural supports in order to build staff capacity.  
Using schools  instructional foci, school leaders  and staff will implement changes  in curriculum,  instruction, 
school  culture  and  structures  so  that  there  are  sustainable  improvements  in  student  outcomes  and  school 
culture. 

 
The arc of the School Renewal Program strategy: 
In order to attain high levels of achievement for all students in Renewal  schools we must build capacity to increase 
student achievement through the adoption of new attitudes and behaviors, research based strategies that improve 
teacher practice, coupled with the use of clear data driven supports for building students’ skills in the content areas and 
increasing student engagement. We are particularly prioritizing reading and writing across the curricula.  The use of 
student learning data will drive instruction through strong teacher teams; onsite, job embedded professional learning 
and problem solving, and accountability at all levels of the system:  central, district and school - for results. Renewal 
schools are provided with intensive training, leadership and pedagogical coaching, and structural supports, monitoring 
of implementation and ongoing feedback and revisions as needed. Further, each Renewal school will become a 
Community School and strategically partner with community based organizations (CBO) to integrate social services and 
expanded learning time into the fabric of the school to help them better serve the needs of students.  These schools will 
stand as centers of opportunities where families can get the supports they need to make sure students come to school 
ready and able to learn. 
 
School Receivership  
In April 2015, state lawmakers and Governor Andrew Cuomo created section 211-f of the State Education Law, which 
established the School Receivership program as a new intervention strategy to turn around struggling schools. This new 
law, and Commissioner’s regulation 100.19, requires that “Persistently Struggling Schools,” defined as Priority Schools 
that have been in the most severe accountability status since the 2006-07 school year, be given an initial one or two-
year period under a “Superintendent Receiver”.  These schools were placed in receivership under the New York City 
Schools Chancellor. Each school must make demonstrable improvement on specific benchmarks or it will be placed 
under an independent receiver. Under the Chancellor’s Receivership Plan, the School Renewal Program is NYCDOE’s 

2017-18 RSCEP-ON

core strategy for turning around struggling schools. Renewal Schools have already begun implementing significant 
interventions and are receiving additional resources and support to accelerate student performance and help close 
achievement gaps reflected in this RSCEP. 
 
Structure of the Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) 

The Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) will serve as the organizing and overarching document for 
each Renewal school and will be directly aligned and developed around the elements of the Framework for Great 
Schools, New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, and Strong Schools, 
Strong Communities, including the following: 

  Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks: Demonstrable improvement benchmarks located in the 2018-19 

RSCEP, in the Data and Accountability Snapshot page.  Receivership benchmarks have been closely aligned with 
the Renewal benchmarks so that schools will have one coherent set of improvement benchmarks to meet.  All 
Receivership Benchmarks are a subset of Renewal Benchmarks. While the targets for these overlapping 
benchmarks are not always identical, the Receivership Benchmark targets are always equal to or lower that the 
Renewal Benchmarks targets. That means that any school that meets its Renewal Benchmarks targets have by 
definition also met its Receivership Benchmarks targets. For additional information on Receivership 
demonstrable improvement benchmarks go here. 

  Establishing an overarching summative vision aligned with elements of the Framework for Great Schools and 

documenting key areas of celebration and renewal through analysis of assessments and by envisioning what the 
desired outcome for each school will be at the end of the School Renewal process.  

  Setting interim assessment benchmarks that create the path for improvement by focusing on desired outcomes 

and goals. In this way, the plan will be mapped to the overarching summative vision. In addition to the five 
discrete goals formed around the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, each school will create an 
action plan. 

  Transformation into a community school in order to increase student and family access to physical and mental 

health services and other social-emotional supports made available in or near the school. 

  Expanded learning opportunities for all students, including additional instruction provided during afterschool 

 

and/or summer programming provided in collaboration with community partners. 
Intensive professional development for all staff to ensure effective implementation of curriculum and 
instruction aligned to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and to support staff in effectively responding 
to the differentiated academic and social-emotional needs of all students. 
  Additional, focused strategies to increase parent and family engagement. 

The RSCEP will also enable Renewal Schools that were designated as “Out of Time” Priority Schools during the 2014-15 
school year to respond to additional state-mandated requirements, including: providing students access to Career and 
Technical Education (CTE) program offerings at schools in Good Standing beginning in the 2018-19 school year; and, 
mandatory professional development for school leadership and staff. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students.

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and RSCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive 
Educational Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for 
continuous improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing 
review and analysis of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement 
activities and strategies that improve outcomes for students. 
 

 
Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other.

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

1.  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
2.  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
3.  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
4.  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
5.  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
6.  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement 
 
NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I. Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II. School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
  

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the RSCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the RSCEP. For additional guidance

Next Steps for RSCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps: 

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional SLT exists in every Renewal school and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the American Institute of Research (AIR) needs 

assessment, the school’s updated NYSED accountability status and most current quantitative and qualitative 
data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE Tenets 
that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) School 
Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not undergo an 
IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most recent Quality 
Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.  

  Step 4: Create a summative vision for the elements of the Framework for Great Schools. 

  Step 5: Revisit the school’s current goals, and strategically create new goals informed by the needs assessment 
and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART – Specific, Measurable, 
Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you monitor progress against the 
qualitative or quantitative measures you have identified, and will let your school community know when you 
have reached your goal.   

  Step 6: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 7: Update the school’s AIS section. Title I schools must also update the Parent Involvement Policy (PIP) and 

School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 8: Complete the Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Community School, Career and Technical Education 

Program (CTE), and Professional Development Plan sections. 

  Step 9: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether strategies and activities outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust practices along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Introduction 

Fordham Leadership Academy is located on the Roosevelt Campus in the Fordham Road section in the Bronx, NY. Our 
diverse student body (400 students) is comprised of 70% Hispanic, 25% Black, 3% White, and 2% Asian students. Our 
percentage of students in Special Education is 25% and those students who receive English as a New Language 
services make up 17% of our total population, which means that almost half of our students have special needs. As a 
Renewal school, now in our fourth year, we have been recipients of targeted support to improve the quality of 
instruction, attendance rate, and strengthen parent and community ties. This process enables us to build a 
community of active intellectual learners who will graduate to become leaders in their communities, careers, and 
promote responsible leadership values. At Fordham Leadership Academy, we cater to the whole child by our 
unwavering commitment to develop future leaders that are prepared for the challenges of the 21st century via 
academic excellence and character development. Our students will experience a leadership curricula across all grade 
levels which will enable them to develop core leadership values over the course of their four years in high school.  

 

Developing Leaders 

As members of the Fordham Leadership community, our students will develop four key leadership qualities we 
believe are essential to become successful leaders. These core leadership values are: Responsibility (9th), Problem-
Solving (10th), Communication (11th), Community Impact (12th). Each year, students within each cohort will select 
from a menu of options, a "leadership commitment", by which they will demonstrate the FLA core values. Upon 
completion of their leadership commitment hours, students will earn a leadership badge and accrue community 
service hours. Community service hours earned via leadership commitments will be documented in students' 
permanent records. 

 

In addition, students will experience other leadership opportunities. Our incoming 9th graders will receive peer 
mentoring via Peer Group Connection (PGC), a program whereby trained upperclassmen become mentors to the 
freshmen (supervised by trained faculty) on a weekly basis during push-in outreach sessions in the advisory class. In 
grades 9-12, students receive advisory twice per week with the support of the Guidance team, comprised of 
counselors, social worker, and SAPIS. Some 11th and 12th graders who choose to become peer mentors and are 
selected are trained under the Peer Group Connection leadership curriculum. During this course, students are trained 
to become peer leaders (mentors) to incoming freshman. All 11th and 12th grade students will also be programmed 
for College Portfolio, a class that provides them with support from our College Advisor to build a college portfolio,

guidance through the application process and financial aid, and support with decision making about their future 
career options.  

College and Career Opportunities 

At Fordham Leadership Academy, students enjoy varying opportunities for college and career readiness exposure via 
exciting common core aligned electives, Advanced Placement courses, College Now courses, College Portfolio class, 
College trips, internships and Summer Youth opportunities. The Expanded Learning Time (ELT) model is an added 
opportunity for students to receive enrichment support such as SAT Prep and Coding. The opportunities for students 
to engage in internships is a constant pursue at FLA and it is a main goal in our with our lead CBO, Center for 
Supportive Schools (CSS). The College Portfolio class is a unique opportunity for our 11th and 12th grade students to 
receive targeted daily coaching on the college application process. The focus is different at each grade level to 
personalize the support to meet the needs at each grade level. The College Portfolio class is provided by our partner, 
NYU College Advising Corp. Our Community School model continues to strengthen our college and career 
opportunities by organizing events such as retreats, Career Day, College Fairs, and resume/career workshops to 
encourage students to build real-life skills and explore their options post high school.  

 

Knowing Our Students 

We have created cohort teams (X, W, V, U) to personalize the support for students and families. Each cohort team is 
comprised of an Assistant Principal, dedicated team of teachers in each content area, guidance counselor, grade 
advisor and school aide. The cohort teams meet weekly to discuss student progress including attendance and other 
factors that may hinder student progress and to plan for activities that nurture and motivate students to remain on 
pace with their goals.  

Leadership Academy has a robust social emotional team comprised of guidance counselors, social workers, youth 
advisors and mentors who provide academic and social emotional development in alignment with our school's core 
values and mission statement. 

After triangulating multiple data sources including Advance observations, inquiry data, NYCDOE Learning Environment 
Survey, Student focus groups, and Quality Review feedback, a major initiative at FLA for the 2018-2019 school year is 
Conferencing. Across content areas and grade levels, teachers will meet with students in small group and individual 
settings on a monthly basis to discuss goals, progress toward benchmarks for both academic and social goals, and 
provide actionable feedback and next steps. Whether formative or summative, teachers will share data with students 
that is up-to-date, and that results in high leverage feedback. A structure for conferencing has been created (spring 
and summer of 2018) to outline expectations and goals during conferences with students, including the pre-planning 
required to have meaningful conversations with students in support of greater student outcomes.  

 

 

Extended Learning Time 

Community School, FLA has an Expanded Learning Time (ELT) model providing our students with five additional 
instructional hours per week, allowing them to earn additional credits and preparation for college and career. For the 
past few years, our ELT expectations were met daily by adding one hour of instruction per day. Beginning with the 
2018 – 2019 school year, instructional time under ELT will be divided as follows: 

  45 min. class daily (period 1) 
  45 min. class on Wednesdays (period 10) 

2017-18 RSCEP-ON                                                              

 

 

 14 

 

  30 min. class on Thursdays (period 10) 

Expanded Learning time courses are credit bearing and were created with student voice and interest in mind. 
Students in grades 10 - 12 select their ELT course or option in the spring during academic planning with the guidance 
of their academic counselor. 

Working with the Framework for Great Schools in Mind  

Our school has made great strides in the components under the Framework for Great Schools as evidenced by 
Advance observations, Quality Review ratings and Learning Environment Surveys. To continue with achieving growth 
in these areas we will expand on the number of teacher leadership positions, refine our professional learning plan to 
align to the needs resulting from inquiry and Regents data, and increase pathways for student and parent leadership.  

 

Supportive Environment 

We maintain a culture of mutual trust and positive attitude that support the academic and personal growth of 
students and adults. Social emotional needs of our students are addressed through a robust social emotional team 
comprised of guidance counselors, social workers, youth advisors, MSW interns, Youth Development counselors 
(partnership with The Leadership Program and Partnership with Children) and a full time Substance Abuse Prevention 
Intervention Specialist (SAPIS). Our open-door policy has made it possible for students to visit any adult including 
teachers and administrators to voice their concerns or to simply find guidance and support, given feedback and share 
new ideas. As a small school we pride ourselves in knowing that every student has at least one adult that they can 
confide in, and we know our students well. In addition, a culture for learning and of high expectations is prevalent 
across classrooms where the use of Common Core curriculum, norms for discussion and making student thinking 
visible, writing and daily positive expectations of behavior amongst students and teachers are consistent. The school's 
grading policy supports these goals by including a component on Leadership for 30% of the grade, aligned to a rubric 
of behavioral and academic expectations and FLA's core values. 

 

Collaborative Teachers 

As a Renewal school, one of our main goals is to create an atmosphere of collaboration and build a culture where 
teachers routinely engage in professional learning with their colleagues. Our teachers meet weekly by content area 
(100 min. after school on Mondays) in dedicated blocks of professional learning by the support of lead teachers, 
Principal and Assistant Principals. This model of professional work was made possible by strategic programming and 
an SBO that promoted the need for co-planning during the day (5 days per week) in addition to the professional 
learning time after school, placing at the forefront of our work the need to strengthen and support our teachers’ 
pedagogical needs to increase student outcomes. Our professional learning has yielded positive incremental gains in 
varying areas of instruction and our student progress monitoring has enabled us to maintain and even improve our 
attendance and scholarship benchmarks.  

 

Strong Family and Community Ties 

Our school has built strong partnerships with several community based organizations to support the reach to families 
and students’ connections to their community. Ramapo, The Leadership Program, and Center for Supportive Schools 
are crucial in our pursuit to nurture our students’ innate leadership skills. Our partners provide our students with 
small group instruction, mentoring, leadership development, and individual counseling. Our parents also receive 
monthly workshops and training opportunities by our partners and outside agencies. English as a Second Language

classes for parents are also offered after school to support our parents with language acquisition and enable them to 
become more actively engaged in their children’s education. Parent Association meetings have reached record 
number of participants averaging 30+ parents at each monthly meeting. 

 

Rigorous Instruction 

In our pursuit to provide students with academic excellence our school has adopted Engage NY for ELA and 
Mathematics curricula, as well as the New Visions for Social Studies and Science curricula. Teachers have received 
extensive support from school leadership and from our Renewal coaches, to unpack the curriculum and adapt it to 
fulfill our students’ varying academic levels and equally provide access to the content and skills for all. Our new 
instructional focus provides a clear expectation for teachers to follow during the planning of lessons (productive 
struggle and making thinking visible in writing and discussion). Teacher practice is gradually showing positive trends 
toward meeting effective expectations as evidenced by Advance observations. Students are experiencing lessons that 
are more student centered, where they are intellectually engaged vs. simply on-task, and they are pushed to make 
their thinking visible both in writing and discussion.  

While there are still inconsistencies in instructional practices by teachers across our school, our cabinet inquiry 
(focused on 1E and later on 3C) has enabled us to move teacher practice (target group of teachers) by harnessing on 
specific subskills in particular components. This shift in practice required a shift in mindset, becoming a part of our 
growing pains in our school community during the first round of observations at the start of year 2 of Renewal. 
Assistant Principals and the Principal will continue to conduct weekly observations (evaluative and non-evaluative) 
and engage in professional conversation with teachers to monitor teacher practice and provide targeted support. 
Renewal instructional coaches meet weekly with the administrative team led by the principal to establish the agenda 
for professional learning, delineate next steps and identify areas of challenge in need of further exploration. 
Instructional coaches and the administrative team will also conduct joint observations to align the school’s 
instructional vision with focused support for each individual teacher. 

Trust 

At our school teachers, administrators and staff work toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, 
preparing students for success in school and beyond. Across our school community, there is respect for each others 
perspectives and contributions to the common goal of improving the quality of education provided to children. School 
staff, parents, students and administrators value each other and there is an open relationship between 
administrators, including the principal and staff to share concerns and ideas to further improve our community and 
yield higher student outcomes. Teacher leadership is promoted via the creation and promotion of teacher 
involvement in committees such as the Professional Learning Committee and the New Teacher professional series, 
and invites teachers to apply to become Peer Collaborative and Model Teachers to build capacity within our school 
and sustain the professional growth gained thus far in the hand of teachers. In addition, in order to provide a platform 
of access for teachers and staff to communicate effectively, the administrative team led by the principal conducts 
monthly faculty meetings, town hall meetings for staff (as needed), and shares expectations, updates and seeks 
support from staff via weekly emails to specific individuals or all staff as applicable.

4.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, 

Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review? 

2017-2018 IIT Recommendation: 

Teacher leaders, coaches, and school leaders should train and support teachers on integrating in their lesson plans a 
minimum of two checks for understanding, scaffolds for students who have not achieved mastery and extensions for 
students who have mastered their standards-based work. These groupings of students, based on who has and has not 
achieved mastery of skills and content, should be flexible.  

Strengths: School leadership will continue to support the implementation and refinement of Common Core curricula 
across the content areas. Our ELA and Mathematics departments have begun the use of EngageNY modules as the 
common curricula all teachers are using. Additionally, Social Studies and Science have also implemented the use of the 
New Visions, Common Core aligned curricula in their content areas as well. To ensure that teachers receive proper 
coaching and support from coaches, administrators and model teachers, teacher programs have been structured to 
allow for daily co-planning by teacher teams to plan and modify lessons aligned to the school’s instructional needs and 
expectations. This allows for increased teacher collaboration around curriculum and an added opportunity for increased 
coaching support.

Needs: While teachers have worked to implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative 
assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning, we have to refine our systems for student 
reflection, tracking of, and ownership of learning. With the support of coaching and teacher feedback, we will work to 
create tasks and reflection protocols that increase opportunities for students to reflect on their work, to be supported 
by our new monthly conferencing structure. Student facing rubrics will be used in this process. This reflection will allow 
for increased student- teacher collaboration with a focus on student created, ‘Next Steps’, increased student ownership 
of their own learning. 

Several Data sources will be used during this process: IIT Review, Central-led review, Quality Review results, NYSED 
school report card, NYC School Quality guide, and the NYC School survey. 

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Rigorous Instruction 

What is your school’s instructional focus? What is your vision for promoting the instructional focus consistently across 
classrooms?   
Our ELA and Mathematics departments will continue to refine the use of EngageNY modules as the common curricula 
all teachers are using. Additionally, Social Studies and Science departments have also implemented the use of the New 
Visions, Common Core aligned curricula in their content areas as well. To ensure that teachers receive proper coaching 
and support from ORS coaches, APs and model teachers, teacher programs have been structured to allow for one day a 
week where all teachers in specific content area have several common preps. This allows for increased teacher 
collaboration around curriculum and increased coaching support. 

The vision for the implementation of our curricula and the learning experiences for our students is manifested in our 
Instructional Focus, If teachers set up daily conditions for learning that engage students in productive struggle via 
rigorous tasks with appropriate scaffolds, then students will become college and career ready." 

Teachers received Professional Development in 2018-2019, beginning with a focus on unpacking the new curricula 
across content areas and alignment of lessons to our school’s instructional focus. Overtime, it became evident that our 
focus needed to be shifted toward 1E in the Danielson framework as our gaps were found primarily in the design of 
coherent instruction which then impacts all other components. The premise of every professional learning session is to 
ensure that lessons impact student achievement and foster a culture of high expectations for learning of students and 
of teachers and administrators. As part of the unpacking process, teachers will collaborate to deepen their 
understanding of content knowledge and understanding of standards. This will allow for the exploration of how the 
standards can be taught to meet the needs of our varied student population. This work will carry over to the 2018-2019 
school year as teachers will continue to utilize and refine EngageNY units for Math and ELA and New Visions for Science 
and Social Studies to meet the needs of our student population.  

In the area of the Arts our teachers are working to collaborate with the content area teachers to promote 
interdisciplinary curricula and units. (See section 6 regarding the Arts). To begin the work of developing a 
comprehensive plan for teachers to partner within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary 
curricula, our 9th grade Social Studies teacher and arts teacher, attended a professional development focusing on 
creating interdisciplinary tasks. Over the summer, additional teachers and coaches met with the arts teacher to review 
curriculum and target lessons that can foster interdisciplinary studies. 

 

Teacher teams will engage in inquiry to look at student work in order to make data-driven decisions for differentiating 
tasks, curriculum and instruction. Formative and summative assessments will include NYC Performance Assessments 
and EngageNY mid-unit, end of unit and Performance-Based Assessments. In grades 9-10, we will use WITsi sentence 
tasks during the course of lessons to formatively assess student progress in skills and content for the purpose of 

2017-18 RSCEP-ON

improving tasks and instruction. Teachers and teacher teams will analyze the results of these formative and summative 
assessments in order to make the necessary curriculum modifications to improve achievement for all students. 

In order to achieve this goal, strategic programming and use of resources was necessary in order to create a master 
schedule that was based on increasing instructional capacity in teachers and academic needs of students.  

Through our collaboration with our Community School Partner, we will offer a full range of academic programs such as 
ELT (internships) and Saturday Academy. Additionally, our College Advisor, will work with our students by providing 
support for our college going culture, social emotional support, and cohort progress monitoring support.  

We have also introduced Advanced Placement courses (English Language and Environmental Science), AP US History, AP 
European History, and AP Spanish Language and high level Science (Chemistry) and Scientific Research in partnership 
with SUNY Albany and the NYCDOE. In addition, for the fall of 2018 semester, we intend to continue with securing 
College Now courses at Lehman College and to increase our partnership with Monroe College. Our vision for college and 
career readiness in the 2018-19 school year is to have at least 60% of our student body enrolled in one or more college 
level courses whether on-site with our College Now partner schools.  

Incoming 9th graders will receive Leadership Advisory 101, a joint effort by our faculty and our CBO partner Center for 
Supportive Schools. The curriculum covers decision making, peer pressure, conflict resolution and goal setting. This will 
be a part of our peer mentoring model, Peer Group Connection (PGC), a program whereby trained upperclassmen will 
become mentors to the freshmen (supervised by trained faculty) on a weekly basis during push-in outreach sessions in 
the advisory class. Our 10th and 11th graders will receive advisory leadership 102, a joint effort by our guidance team 
and our partner The Leadership Program and PWC covering a curriculum that focuses on building civic awareness, 
community engagement, and exposure to local issues and Human Rights causes. This course will provide students with 
hands on experience via trips and interaction with varying community organization and local officials. Some 11th 
graders who choose to become peer mentors and are selected will be exposed to the Peer Group Connection 
curriculum by which they will be trained to become peer leaders (mentors) to incoming freshman. This is also an option 
for our 12th graders. Our 12th graders will receive college advisory 300, a joint effort between our CBO, guidance team 
and our partner NYU Advising Corps. All 11th and 12th grade students will also be programmed for College Portfolio, a 
class that provides them with support from our College Advisor to build their college portfolio, guidance through the 
application process and financial aid, and support with decision making about their future. 

We will continue to work on providing teachers with support to move their practice from teacher-centered instruction 
to student centered; one by which students engage in a productive struggle and take an active role in their learning as 
they arrive to their own evidence-based conclusions. To make this evident in all classrooms the school's Instructional 
Focus for the 2018-2019 school year will be,  

If teachers use formative and summative data in order to create daily conditions for learning that engage students in 
productive struggle via daily rigorous tasks with appropriate scaffolds, then they will become college and career 
ready. 

It is important to highlight that the school’s instructional focus and professional learning plan has been refined over 
the summer months to include pathways to increase student ownership of their learning.  

A high leverage focus for our school must support student ownership of learning. To serve this purpose, we will 
adjust our curriculum pacing to provide specific and time-bound opportunities each semester for students to self 
assess against content- and-skill aligned rubrics (student facing) as well as their progress in each individual course 
toward meeting graduation requirements.  

By June 2019, our NYSED four-year graduation rate will meet or exceed 88%.

What is your vision for the implementation of CCLS-aligned curricula that meets the needs of your diverse learners, 
personally, academically, and culturally?  
Across all classrooms teachers will implement CCLS aligned curricula. Curricula will be unpacked with teachers and 
modifications will be required to meet the needs of all learners, including students with IEPs and ELLs. We are taking 
into consideration our students' cultural backgrounds and thus have created special electives in which Latino and 
immigrant cultural experiences will be explored since the majority of our population are predominantly from these two 
groups. 

 

 

What is your vision for diverse program offerings that allow students to develop skills, habits, and behaviors to be 
career and college ready? How are instructional shifts embedded in this vision? 
In addition to exciting electives that explore diverse cultures, we also will offer a variety of courses that will tap into our 
students' diverse interests. Some examples of these courses are in Mythology, Chess, Theatre, College Now and AP 
courses. 

 

 

What do you envision the delivery of instruction to look like so that all students are set up for success?  
Our classrooms are student-centered and our instructional vision is evident in the quality of the task. Academic 
discourse (with the use of protocols) is part of the experience of learning and students are developing their literacy skills 
consistently-writing, reading.  

 

 

How do you envision teachers using multiple entry points to ensure the success of every child? 
The use of data (formative and summative) is used to modify curriculum, create unit plans, and lessons that take into 
consideration our diverse population of learners. Scaffolds will be created and a progression plan identified and 
executed over the course of the year to support students' growth and create an expectation for independence in 
learning in our students. 

 

 

What is your vision for the use of a comprehensive assessment strategy (diagnostic, formative, benchmark, and 
summative) to drive curricular, instructional, and organizational decisions that impact student outcomes? 
We will utilize baselines and mid year assessments to monitor the progress of our students. Our Regents data (January, 
June and August) currently supports our programming, instructional, and PD decisions.

4b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
Following the orientation in June of 2018, beginning in July 2018, families of incoming 9th graders are invited for 
meetings with guidance, administrators and parent coordinator. The goal is to unpack academic goals, share curricula 
expectations and to learn about ways we could support their transition to HS. In addition, curriculum night is 
scheduled for late September. This is an opportunity for teachers to share the expectations of their courses, ways to 
support their children at home with assignments, and how to seek help. Key personnel for implementation and 
oversight include administrators, teacher leaders and the parent coordinator. Throughout the school year, families 
are invited to monthly events (workshops, classes, Breakfast with the Principal, PA, SLT, CET) geared to creating a 
stronger connection with school staff, including the leadership of the school and are encouraged to provide monthly 
feedback during these events. The school has an open door policy and parents are encouraged to come in freely, 
without the need for an appointment, to learn about their children's progress and ways to support their growth.

Part 6 – Progress Monitoring  

Part 6a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
Similar to your Annual Goal, your mid-point benchmark should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound. 
Weekly cabinet-level inquiry around teacher practice aligned to sub-skills of Danielson components 1a, 1e, 3b, 3c, and 
3d. Our cabinet inquiry focus is on 1E based on the patterns across teacher gaps in this component. 

Schools leaders will conduct frequent cycles of classroom observations and analysis of student work and data, and 
monitor teacher progress using Advance Data reports. Formal and informal cycles will be used and inform individual 
next steps for teachers--the use of google docs will track timely feedback to teachers. 

Quarterly reviews of data will take place to monitor progress toward benchmarks as follows: 

November 2019 

By November 2019, we will review scholarship reports (marking period 1/fall semester) for day time and after school 
classes, and mock Regents results to determine students' progress toward earning 10+ credits and Regents passing 
skills based on the first marking period results. This review will inform our gains toward our benchmarks in progress 
toward graduation, Regents completion for years 2 and 3 and graduation. Subsequently this data will inform what 
next steps or revisions to our plans will be made as corrective action whenever applicable. 

February 2019 

By February 2019, we will review Regents data, individual student Credit Accumulation and Scholarship Reports to 
ensure that progress is being made towards our June 2019 goal for Teacher implementation of curricula, which will 
lead to Student Progress/Performance and more students on track for an increased graduation rate. The midpoint 
benchmark for this goal is 85% for credit accumulation in grades 9 - 11, 5% above last year's January Regents data 
across ELA, Math, Science and Social Studies Regents exams and will be monitored during our school's weekly data 
meetings. Subsequently this data will inform what next steps or revisions to our plans will be made as corrective 
action whenever applicable. 

April 2019 

By April 2019, we will review scholarship reports (marking period 1/spring semester) for day time and after school 
classes, and mock Regents results to determine students' progress toward earning 10+ credits and Regents passing 
skills based on the first marking period results. This review will inform our gains toward our benchmarks in progress 
toward graduation, Regents completion for years 2 and 3 and graduation. Subsequently this data will inform what 
next steps or revisions to our plans will be made as corrective action whenever applicable.

By June 2019 we will review final credit accumulation data, Regents data and individual scholarship reports to 
determine the impact of our action plans and identify gaps to establish short-term goals for August 2019 in support of 
school-wide benchmarks (progress toward graduation, college readiness, Regents completion and graduation rate). 

 
Part 6b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. 
Regents and credit accumulation data from NYC DOE systems such as STARS and ATS and the NV Data Tool. NV Data 
Check-ins support progress monitoring. 

 
Part 6c. In February 2018, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

Part 2 – Summative Vision for Supportive Environment 

What is your vision for a supportive school environment? How will you in partnership with each CBO and families 
enact your vision? 
 

Fordham Leadership Academy has created a school environment that is welcoming to students and their families. In 
addition, FLA has a partnership with a Community School Partner. Students are represented by an active student council 
that meets at least monthly with the principal to discuss matters important to the student body. The school’s Parent 
Association and School Leadership Team (SLT) meet monthly as well. There are two student representatives who are 
part of the SLT. The school’s community-based partner and runs SAT prep classes for students, sets up internships for

students and assists the school in the goal of making every student ready for college or a career following graduation 
from high school. 

In addition, our school has built strong partnerships with several community based organizations to support the 
outreach to families and students’ connections to their community. The Leadership Program, and Center for Supportive 
Schools are crucial in our pursuit to nurture our students’ innate leadership skills. Our partners provide our students 
with small group instruction, mentoring, leadership development, and individual counseling. Our parents also receive 
monthly workshops and training opportunities by our partners and outside agencies. English as a Second Language 
classes for parents are also offered after school to support our parents with language acquisition and enable them to 
become more actively engaged in their children’s education.  

In order to be proactive in promoting students’ socio-emotional skills, the school maintains several community 
partnerships. The Leadership Program provides two full-time counselors and 6 MSW interns who provide crisis 
intervention services to approximately 80 students during the school day and on Saturdays. They also run “Lunch and 
Learn” counseling sessions with students. The Leadership Program also uses the “Her Voice” curriculum to empower 
young women to become self-sufficient, career-oriented and self-motivated. Another program is the RISE program 
which supports attendance improvement. FLA also has a partnership with Montefiore Hospital which provides 2 full-
time social workers that work with at-risk students.  

Academic Supports for Students 

FLA school staff meets regularly to assess trends in academic performance. Special attention is given to students 
identified by the guidance department whose academic performance has fallen. Grade level teams, composed of 
teachers, guidance counselors and APs, meet every week to review student attendance, credit accumulation, and plan 
interventions to support students in staying on track towards graduation. Using multiple data sources and the New 
Visions data tracking tool, our school identifies students who are almost on track for graduation and they will meet with 
their teacher mentors every other week (formal) and weekly check ins to review their progress towards graduation, 
including attendance and formative and summative assessment data to then delineate next steps for individual 
students.  

On a monthly basis, guidance counselors, Youth Advisor, SAPIS (Substance Abuse Prevention and Intervention Specialist) 
worker, school social workers and administration meet to discuss OORS reports and teacher referrals to ascertain which 
students need additional social/ emotional support. 

FLA hopes to have a full-time attendance teacher in the future. If this is not feasible, a family worker will do attendance 
outreach. At the current time, a part-time attendance teacher (2 days per week) makes home visits and works to 
improve student attendance rates. 

 

Parental Outreach 

The Parent Coordinator in our school provides a key element of communication with parents, and assists in organizing 
and implementing activities designed to enhance parental involvement and student achievement. As a result of this 
work our Parent Association meetings has been strengthened and the PA has reached record number of participants, 
averaging 30+ parents at monthly meeting. The PA works with the Parent Coordinator to determine community needs 
and meaningful initiatives for parents. 

 

Social-Emotional Supports for Students and Families 

2017-18 RSCEP-ON                                                              

 

 

 41 

 

Through our CBO partner we will continue to provide students, teachers and their families with a full menu of supports 
in social emotional services and expanded academics such as mental health services with school psychologists, social 
emotional support by medical students from Einstein, “Let’s Get Ready” SAT prep classes. In addition to this, our school 
community will also provide students with the opportunity to obtain internships that lead to further college and career 
ready experiences. 

In addition to our three guidance counselors we hope to get a fourth guidance counselor. Our counselors will be 
assigned to specific cohorts and one counselor will provide college advisory services for students. Our community school 
partner, will also provide mental health providers including a full time social worker and bilingual school psychology 
interns who will work with individuals or small groups of students. Students will be referred by teachers, administrators 
or family members seeking support during challenging times. Mental health providers will keep logs and anecdotal notes 
to record their work with students and/or families. Meetings will be conducted with teachers, administrators and 
Community School Partners to discuss the progress and changes the students have made. 

Needs assessments, questionnaires and self-reflections will be utilized as a means to respond to student social-
emotional growth concerns and needs. Student attendance will continue to be closely monitored by guidance 
counselors and community mental health staff. Data will be reviewed at team meetings and cases will be reviewed 
individually. 

Student voice will be supported through leadership opportunities and trainings and via our new student council body of 
representatives. The student council meets weekly led by our COSA (Coordinator of Student Activities) and the principal 
is invited to join the meeting on a monthly basis. 

Because of the support structures set up for our students and families we anticipate raising attendance rates for our 
school. For June 2019 our attendance goal is 94%. As a result of our efforts to create a supportive environment, we 
anticipate a 4% increase by June 2019 for an overall rate of at least 93%.

support  the  whole  child?  Include  the  timeline  and  identify  key  personnel  and  stakeholders  responsible  for 
implementation and oversight. 
Summer meetings with parents will provide a venue for FLA staff to engage with families about our robust system of 
social emotional supports to nurture the whole child. This is an ongoing effort that begins in the summer, continues 
into the fall via PA and SLT meetings, and guidance events. Key personnel and stakeholders responsible for the 
implementation and oversight are the CSD, Principal, Parent Coordinator and AP of Student Services.

Strengths 

Our school has a strong and large teacher leadership team comprised of one Master teacher, three Model teachers, and 
other teachers, who are not in official teacher leadership titles but do serve in many capacities as key instructional 
support in their departments. These teachers are part of FLA's instructional cabinet and along with the school's 
administration, analyze instructional practices, design and deliver professional learning across the school and lead 
inquiry work. The instructional cabinet team meets weekly to discuss instructional needs school-wide and design 
targeted actionable plans to address pedagogical and cultural needs. The Instructional Cabinet has resulted in increased 
teacher ownership and collaboration. This in turn has impacted our scholarship and Regents completion rate, as well as 
graduation rate. Different data trends resulting from our inquiry work (Data Wise) have led us to make the necessary 
adjustments to the coaching goals for the team and strengthen certain practices such as learning walks. These trends 
include teacher performance in components 3d and 3c, and students' use of content specific vocabulary and 
performance on analytical style essays. 

Needs 

The Instructional Cabinet needs to increase the amount of intervisitations across departments in the coming year to 
further analyze patterns and trends as well as the fidelity of the implementation of strategies derived from our inquiry 
work. Furthermore, a school-wide pedagogical goal is to refine our assessment practices and the teacher leadership 
team will roll out a series of PDs for teachers (whole-faculty and department) to address these needs, norm on 
expectations and provide resources. 

2017-18 RSCEP-ON                                                              

 

 

 48 

 

The instructional leadership team will develop a schedule for classroom intervisitations and demo-lab lessons, as well as 
coaching schedule and memorialize this work in rolling agendas. The impact of this work will be evaluated via evaluative 
and non-evaluative rounds of observations by the admin. team and instructional teacher leaders. 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Collaborative Teachers 

What is your vision for collaborative teaching?   

Organizing for Collaboration  

Teachers meet weekly by content area in dedicated blocks of professional instructional planning with the support from 
coaches and Assistant Principals. This schedule allows for several periods of uninterrupted planning time for teachers 
who teach the same grade, for ICT pairs, and for integrated ENL pairs. 

In addition, five additional periods are dedicated to cohort progress monitoring and self-directed professional learning 
based on individual teacher need as follows: 

  Data Wise teams in all content areas. . 
  Cohort progress monitoring 
 

Self-directed or independent professional learning (intervisitations, lesson planning, peer collaboration). 

A professional development committee will include at least one representative from each core content area as well as 
any teacher leaders (model, master, peer collaborative teachers) that exist in the school. The PD committee will meet at 
least twice per month to provide feedback to school leadership around department specific professional development 
needs as well as help plan professional learning experiences for the entire school, ensuring that there is consistency 
across the departments. Teacher collaboration will also be enhanced through monthly inter-visitations, hosted by 
teacher leaders (model, master, peer collaborative).  

 

Teaching & Learning  

The vision for teaching and learning at Fordham Leadership Academy is grounded in our school wide instructional focus: 

If teachers use formative and summative data to create daily conditions for learning that engage students in productive 

struggle via daily rigorous tasks with appropriate scaffolds, then students 

 

will become college and career ready. 

The instructional focus provides a clear expectation for teachers to follow during the planning of lessons (tasks that 
engender productive struggle and making thinking visible in writing and discussion). Students are experiencing lessons 
that are student centered, with rigorous tasks, whereby being intellectually engaged vs. simply on-task, and they are 
pushed to make their thinking visible both in writing and discussion with scaffolds that support all learners.  

 

2017-18 RSCEP-ON                                                              

 

 

 49 

 

Our ELA and Mathematics departments will use EngageNY as the common curricula across grade levels. Social Studies 
(US History and Global History) and Science teachers (Living Environment and Earth Science) will use New Visions, 
common core aligned curricula. CUNY Debating US History is the curriculum for US History. 

 

Assessment & Data Driven Instruction  

Summative assessments will include NYC Performance Assessments and EngageNY mid-unit, end of unit and 
Performance-Based Assessments. Where assessments are not provided by the curriculum, teacher teams will use the 
departmental planning days to develop common end of unit assessments. Departmental teacher teams will analyze the 
results of these assessments in order to make the necessary curriculum modifications to improve achievement for all 
students. 

 

In grades 9-10, interdisciplinary grade level inquiry teams will collaboratively develop WITsi sentence tasks to 
formatively assess student progress in writing skills and content knowledge. The teacher teams will analyze the results 
of these formative assessments in order to make the necessary modifications to lesson plans and tasks in order to 
provide all students access to the curriculum. In grades 11-12, interdisciplinary grade level inquiry teams will analyze 
Regents exam data and item analysis reports to identify the specific skill gaps that will improve student success on the 
Regents. Teachers will research and implement interventions to address these skill gaps.  

 

All grade level teams will meet every other week with the grade level guidance counselor and APs to review student 
attendance, credit accumulation, and plan appropriate interventions to support students in staying on track towards 
graduation. Using the new visions data tracking tool, students who are almost on track for graduation will be assigned 
teacher mentors. Students will meet with their teacher mentors every other week to review their progress towards 
graduation, including, but not limited to attendance and formative and summative assessment data on Skedula.  

 

Student Centered Learning Environment 

Aligned with our school mission of developing future leaders, students will be given opportunities to collaborate with 
teachers and guidance counselors in order to take ownership of their own learning and advocate for their individual 
needs. Through a student-teacher conferencing framework provided by the accreditation committee, teachers will 
provide structured time, three times per marking period for student-teacher conferences in order to discuss the unique 
strengths and challenges of each student, as well as develop action plans for improvements. In addition, guidance 
counselors will meet with students formally at least twice per year to review their individualized graduation plans. 
Guidance counselors will also assist students in reviewing their formative and summative assessment data on Skedula to 
allow students to reflect on their progress towards accumulating credits. The culture for learning will be reflected in our 
classrooms by exhibiting print-rich classrooms showcasing student work products. 

 

To ensure every child feels safe and supported at Fordham Leadership Academy, uniformed practices for prevention of 
incidents and interventions will be established and adhered to by all stakeholders. Further promoting our student 
centered culture for learning, teachers will communicate expectations for learning in student-friendly language for every 
lesson, which includes what students are learning, why they are learning it and how they will be assessed on this 
learning.  

 

2017-18 RSCEP-ON

Strengths 

Fordham Leadership Academy’s strengths lie in our growing professional collaboration and supportive environment. At 
our school, this is evidenced by our weekly professional learning sessions and the implementation of the instructional 
strategies across classrooms. Our supportive environment has reduced the percentage of students involved in high level 
incidents and has produced positive trends in attendance (share specific YTD data). 

 

Priority Needs 

Below are key areas of priority: 

 

●Professional Learning sessions must continue to provide targeted and evidence-based (Advance data) support for 
teachers to grow pedagogically and align practices to our school’s instructional focus. 

2017-18 RSCEP-ON                                                              

 

 

 56 

 

●Leaders will continue to make strategic decisions in programming and use of resources to support teacher 
collaboration student achievement. 

●Leaders will continue to to work diligently to norm on instructional expectations and to provide effective high leverage 
feedback and support to improve teacher practice. 

●Leaders will continue to build teacher leaders that can lead the work with their colleagues around instruction and high 
expectations across classrooms. 

Leaders will make strategic evidence-based decisions to modify attendance plan to meet and exceed attendance 
benchmarks for the 2018-19 school year, with special emphasis on our chronic absenteeism population.  

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Effective School Leadership 

What is your vision for effective school leadership at your school? 

 

Fordham Leadership Academy’s school leaders will articulate the shared mission and vision through many vehicles, all 
working to build a community of trust as we develop our students into academically strong leaders. This shared vision 
will be communicated clearly faculty meetings, parent meetings, student town halls, SLT Meetings and collaborative 
meetings with Community School Partner and community linkage organizations, The Leadership Program, Center for 
Supportive Schools, Partnership with Children and NYU Advising Corps. 

Our chosen Community School Partner, will be committed to support our school’s goals and will provide a full time 
Community School Director, who will interface with school leaders on a daily basis, ensuring that the initiatives and 
linkages are working seamlessly to support students, teachers and families. Our community school partner will ensure 
that our attendance practices yield the expected outcomes of student achievement and will strengthen the leadership 
and real-life experiences (internships and college now) for our students. Our school’s vision to provide students with 
quality instruction, leadership education, and strong social emotional supports will guide all our efforts in not only 
instruction but as well as in our attendance, community and parental outreach, and training of teachers. 

Evidence based systems will monitor the progress of student achievement as a result of our practices. Such systems will 
be: 

●weekly leadership meetings (inclusive of instructional coaches) to align evidence in teacher practice with the Danielson 
rubric to identify gaps and provide targeted support. 

●weekly attendance meetings led by leaders in partnership with community school partner (team is also comprised of 
attendance aides, teachers, counselors, social workers and secretary) will focus on a review of varying data sources (ATS 
and New Visions data tool) to review individual high leverage cases, reveal patterns, and formulate next steps. 

●weekly cohort progress monitoring meetings led by school leaders will use attendance and scholarship data (provided 
by teachers and derived from DOE systems) to track the progress of target groups and decide on individual next steps. 

●Daily review of attendance data by principal and daily check-ins with attendance support staff and community school 
partner will support immediate actionable steps to capture accurate attendance. 

●bi-weekly meetings led by leaders with PM and Saturday school staff to review attendance and academic data to 
assess progress (DOE systems and Plato) will enable teams to decide on next steps. 

2017-18 RSCEP-ON                                                              

 

 

 57 

 

●Cabinet Inquiry 

 

School leaders will continue to organize student programs to ensure that there is appropriate time allotted for extended 
day program and any time necessary for meetings with support staff. Strategic use of resources including SIG monies 
will be aligned to school priorities: 

●School partnerships with The Leadership Program, Center for Supportive Schools will continue in order to support our 
school’s mission to provide a whole-child education and foster leadership skills and mindset among our students. 

●Teachers College will provide additional support to enhance our instructional practices by working with our 
professional learning committee teachers and principal to deepen rounds of intervisitations (learning walks) amongst 
the team and expanding this practice school wide with the ultimate goal of building trust and honest conversations 
around teacher practice. Teachers College will support our professional learning committee’s efforts to execute teacher 
led professional learning sessions for teachers as an extension of the learning in the weekly content area meetings. 
Teachers College will also continue to support our non-core teachers with pedagogical support (Art, Music, Foreign 
Language) to align their instructional practices with the school’s instructional vision. 

●Teachers’ programs will be scheduled to ensure time for teacher teams, dedicated blocks of professional learning 
sessions per week, and student progress monitoring meetings. Most teachers will continue to engage in 10 professional 
learning periods per week vs. 5 as a result of a lower number of teaching periods per week stemming from strategic use 
of budget. 

Incentives for attendance and scholarship will be provided for students in the forms of trips and rewards (i.e. movie 
tickets) on a monthly basis. 

School leaders will continue to utilize the Danielson Framework observation protocol. Leaders will continue the practice 
of meeting together to norm and review all observations, the principal reviews APs observation reports to provide 
actionable feedback that can guide a clear pathway of support for teachers in alignment with our instructional 
expectations. Actionable feedback and next steps will be discussed during weekly cabinet meetings to ensure that 
leaders are all providing feedback in “one voice” and that next steps are planned and delineated in a sequential, 
organized manner, with appropriate support to affect teacher progress. The use of non-evaluative observations will 
continue as a measure to build trust and coherent support for teachers. Advance observation reports will be used 
weekly at cabinet meetings and with instructional coaches to align professional learning agendas and individual support 
for teachers. 

School leaders and Community partners will develop a shared accountability model to ensure that there is consistent 
communication and review of data (school report, attendance data, teacher and support staff feedback) that will 
provide information to determine progress of students. This is a daily task that formally takes shape in faculty meetings 
with a transparent review of data and that seeks the participation of the school community to arrive at actionable plans. 

School Leaders will delegate instructional supervision to Assistant Principals (specific content areas will be assigned) 
with observation, supervision of teacher teams and professional learning sessions as well as administrative tasks such as 
attendance, guidance intervention, procurement and safety, as well as after-school credit accumulation programs. 
Assistant principals will supervise specific cohorts of students (U, V, W, X) and its support staff including counselors, 
social workers and aides to ensure active engagement of all staff members to fulfill our student achievement 
benchmarks. Assistant Principals be an integral part of Community School Partnership and will participate in 
collaborative meetings.  

The Community School Director will collaborate with school leaders on a daily basis to ensure that linkages and 
programs are working and supporting students academically and social-emotionally.

Early Dismissal (Mondays only) 

Our work is heavily dependent on teacher development and support. Therefore, next year’s schedule will increase the 
amount of time for professional learning and support for teachers and will require an early dismissal of students once a 
week on Mondays (1:59 PM). The instructional time lost on Mondays will be recovered during the rest of the week and 
there will be no impact to the instructional minutes required for credit accumulation and college readiness, or 
transportation (if required by student’s IEP). 

Expanded Learning Time 

As a Community School, FLA has an Expanded Learning Time (ELT) model providing our students with five additional 
instructional hours per week, allowing them to earn additional credits and preparation for college and career. For the 
past few years, our ELT expectations were met daily by adding one hour of instruction per day. Beginning with the 2018 
– 2019 school year, instructional time under ELT will be divided as follows: 

  45 min. class daily (period 1) 
  45 min. class on Wednesdays (period 10) 
  30 min. class on Thursdays (period 10) 

 

 
Part 3 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools – Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be consistent with the 
expectations in part 2, responsive to the identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART – 
Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Meeting your SMART goal should directly impact 
meeting at least one of your Renewal Benchmarks and/or Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks. 
By June 2019, school leaders will have implemented frequent cycles of evaluative and non-evaluative observations 
aligned to the Danielson Framework, with timely actionable feedback and targeted professional learning opportunities, 
resulting in 60% of teachers (representing a 10% increase from SY 17-18) earning an EOY rating of Effective or higher on 
Domain 3 of the Danielson Framework.

collaboratively to deepen 
quality of feedback and 
next steps. 

Administrative Cabinet 
meets weekly to assess 
that feedback and next 
steps for teachers are 
being followed 
sequentially by all 
leaders. This procedure 
strengthens the norming 
of observation feedback 
and ratings and drives 
the work of school 
leaders in the area of 
teacher practice.  

With the support of our 
CBO, we will identify and

Part 6 – Progress Monitoring  

Part 6a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
Similar to your Annual Goal, your mid-point benchmark should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound. 
By October 2019, school leaders including teacher leaders, will have determined based on Advance data the patterns 
and trends and teachers who need most support. This will inform our plans for professional learning and allow us to 
make informed decisions regarding coaching and other targeted supports. 

By February 2019, School Leaders and Staff will review data for teacher practice (Advance observations, non 
evaluative observations data, professional learning feedback and contribution) and will determine next steps to 
achieve intended outcome. Professional Learning plans and coaching supports will be readjusted accordingly. By 
February 2019, at least 45% of our teachers should have an overall rating of Effective in Domain 3. 

By April 2019, School leaders and teacher leaders will review Advance data to determine final changes to the 
professional learning plan and coaching supports that can cause the most impact in teacher pedagogy during the final 
months of school as students enter sumative assessments such as final exams and Regents. 

 
Part 6b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress.

Strengths 

●Fordham Leadership administration and staff understand and thoroughly believe that strong family and community 
ties are essential for student achievement and for the well-being of our students and school community. Our school has 
worked hard to develop programs and ties with our parents and larger school community that demonstrate our 
commitment to family and community engagement on behalf of students. 

●Our most recent IIT Report demonstrates that our school leaders have communicated high expectations for student 
academic achievement to our students, parents and larger community. 

 

●We are committed and have demonstrated a welcoming school environment and our parents have responded by 
strengthening our Parent Association, both in terms of numbers of parents at their PA meetings and activities in the 
school. 

●Our partnership with CSS as our Community School Partner has worked to increase parent involvement and provided 
many and varied resources for students and their families.

Challenges 

●While we have clear anecdotal evidence of increased parent and community involvement in the school’s activities, we 
must now take the next step and systematically track this increased participation, reflect on it, and make changes where 
necessary to improve even more. 

We have noticed that we could also improve parental involvement in student academics and we plan to expand our 
engagement with parents through trainings and educational opportunities that will develop parents’ skills and provide 
more and clearer information about student academic performance. This will include regular monthly meetings with the 
parents, that focus on the use of Skedula to track and monitor student progress as well as probing questions and 
discussions parents can ask students about the work they are doing in school. Parents will be invited to be active leaders 
in the planning of events and participate in focus groups that can provide data to plan additional events related to 
academics and supportive environment. 

 

Data sources leveraged to inform and adjust decisions are the Quality Review results, NYC school survey, NYSED school 
report card, school-based focus groups and IIT findings. 

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Strong Family and Community Ties 

What is your vision for having strong family and community ties at your school? 

 

  Within the Community School model, how will families be welcomed into the school and made a part of the 
school community? What support will school safety officers and all staff be given to help create a welcoming 
environment?  

At Fordham Leadership we work hard to create a strong school culture and a welcoming environment. Families will 
continue to be welcomed into school by all stakeholders within the school community. 

Orientations: Families will be invited to school orientations where they will have an opportunity to meet and talk with 
school leaders, parent leader, community school partners, guidance and support staff and safety officers. Of course, 
translation will be provided where necessary and based on parent surveys to determine need. 

In addition, we will conduct a series of meetings for our families to explain our new Community School Partnership with 
and all of the resources and programs that our CBO will be providing that will enrich and support the lives of our 
students and families. 

Teachers and our staff will make regular calls home to maintain open lines of communication. The school will encourage 
teachers and counselors to call home regularly with positive feedback as well. In addition there will be automated calls 
when students are late and absent. 

 

School Safety will receive training regarding de-escalating situations in order to enhance an environment of respect and 
collegiality. In addition the Borough Safety Office will work with our building School Safety officers to help them with 

2017-18 RSCEP-ON                                                              

 

 

 65 

 

their training. After such training, School Safety will meet with the Parent Association to re-assure them that they will be 
working with the students and staff to assure a safe environment. 

 

Parents are welcomed into the guidance suite when they come in to meet with teachers and staff. There is a 
multifunctional space within the guidance suite used for parents as needed. 

 

 

●How does the school provide support to families so that they understand and can take an active role in what their child 
is learning? 

School leaders and Community School partner staff will conduct meetings for families to share information on student 
achievement data. Individual meetings with Guidance Counselors will also be conducted so that families can access and 
understand their child’s progress and any concerns that may impact their achievement goals. 

 

Fordham Leadership Academy uses the online grading system “Pupil Path” to provide information to students and 
parents regarding student performance, homework, and, progress. Parent trainings are held at the beginning of the year 
and during Parent Teacher conferences. Parents and students are given training in how to access and use Pupil Path, in 
order to take ownership of their own learning. Parents have been extremely supportive of this program. 

 

Our goal for 2018-19 is for the school to send Progress reports home to parents regularly from all classes, in order to 
provide both online and paper progress reports. 

 

Parent Teacher conferences are held in the fall and in the spring. At these conferences parents meet with their son’s or 
daughter’s teachers and come up with action plans for improvement. Prime consideration is given for how parents can 
help their son or daughter at home.  

 

During 2017-18 more than 160 families came to Parent Teacher conference night. Our goal for 2018-19 is 180. We will 
work with our CBO and SLT to incentivize parent attendance at these Conferences. 

 

We will also work to establish protocols for teachers will make regular calls home to continually update parents on 
student progress, especially to give parents advance notice when a student is failing. 

 

2017-18 RSCEP-ON                                                              

 

 

 66 

 

The Parent Association is well-organized and well-situated as primary tool of engagement between families and the 
school. The PA leadership has regular meetings with the principal and has developed a strong rapport with school 
leadership. 

 

In addition the parent coordinator is a primary focal point of communication, ensuring that teachers are aware of parent 
concerns. The parent coordinator meets regularly with parents on the Parent Association, as well as other parents. 

 

Individual meetings between teachers and parents are held when necessary and at parent teacher conferences. 

 

In addition, parent informational workshops will be provided to parents to help them understand elements of the 
curriculum and what students are expected to learn.  

 

Our Goals in this area: 

 

In order to improve even more in the area of community and family engagement we have proposed the following areas 
for growth:  

 

1.Student questionnaires will be used to gauge student interests, both for elective and after school classes. 
Questionnaires will be developed based on several choices of classes that fit the leadership of the school. 

 

2. In early October the school will offer a Curriculum Night in which parents will attend and receive a copy of their son or 
daughter’s program. The parents will follow their son or daughter’s daily schedule to meet all their teachers, receive a 
syllabus and learn about the expectations for the classes and how the students will be graded. This will create a much 
better sense for parents about what their son or daughter is going through in school, as well as what the expectations 
are. 

 

 

3. Upper class parents and ninth grade teachers will meet with 9th Grade parents to orient them on expectations and 
the importance of the 9th grade. This grade is the gateway to high school graduation, and it is very important that 
students get off to a great start in high school, especially in terms of credit accumulation. 

 

4. In the Fall, guidance and college counselors will offer 12th grade parents meetings specifically devoted to the college 
process and timeline. In January, there will be an additional meeting with parents to discuss the details of FAFSA and 

2017-18 RSCEP-ON                                                              

 

 

 67 

 

Financial Aid. In May or June, the College office will meet with Junior parents to orient them to the beginning of the 
process and what they should know about college applications. 

 

CBO Activities Parent Engagement 

We have conducted Community Engagement Team (CET) Meetings following the School Leadership Team (SLT) 
Meetings, where we discuss items pertinent to the Community Schools Program (CSP) in the school.  

The CSP Director at the Fordham Leadership Academy works closely with the Parent Coordinator to notify and recruit 
parents for a number of Family Engagement workshop activities such as: 

Hispanic Heritage Night 

Open House 

Nutrition and Healthy Eating (with Montefiore) 

How to Manage your Money (with Capitol Bank) 

Dual Capacity Training offered by the Community School Project to assist us in providing additional parent engagement 
activities. 

Representatives from the Mayor’s Office on Domestic Violence to provide the parents with a workshop on detecting the 
signs of an unhealthy relationship in their children. 

Know Your Rights workshops (immigration forum) 

College Night 

FAFSA Night 

 

Attendance: 

Parents are kept informed of their children’s attendance on a daily basis and the CSP reviews attendance and strategizes 
for improvement on a weekly basis. We meet weekly and review attendance rates by Cohorts. We have instituted “the 
Battle of the Cohorts” to give incentives for highest attendance by cohort. In addition, we promote perfect attendance 
inducements – pizza parties and movie tickets and maintain the Battle of the Cohorts bulletin board.  

We have also informed the CET about our attendance improvement plan. 

 

College and Career: 

The CBO is working to enhance college and career awareness of the students in the following areas: 

Tours and Orientations in the following Colleges and Universities were made during the fall of 2017.

Student achieve college credit through their participation in College Now with the City University of New York (CUNY) by 
attending Lehman College (Fall ’18) and Bronx Community College (Spring ’19). In total we have over sixty (68) students 
who take courses for college credit at these institutions. 

 

CBO also provides after school tutoring in the specific content areas for students. These Fordham University tutors, who 
are undergraduate majors in the content areas they tutor, push-in to classes during the last period and then remain for 
small group follow-up. Students also have visited to Co-Op Tech, where they can attend trades classes as well as attend 
their current High School for academic classes. 

 

Social / Emotional  

CBO has provided the school with the Social / Emotional assistance needed for their students. We currently have 
Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with Montefiore Hospital which has a clinic on the school campus and will 
provide additional services to the school through their Social Worker. New York Foundling will provide a full-time Social 
Worker to the school and will also provide workshops for the students and parents. Ramapo for Children is providing a 
Team Building retreat for the school staff and will give workshops to the teachers on classroom management techniques 
and in de-escalating student behavior effectively. Two youth overnight retreats to Ramapo for Children for the Spring 
semester are also being planned for selected students to engage in team building and healthy behavior skills. 

 

The CSP facilitates the “Student of the Week” program where students are recognized by their teachers for 
improvement in behavior and/or academics. 

 

Contracted Services: 

CSS has subcontracted the following agencies to provide additional support to our students at the Fordham Leadership 
Academy: 

 

 

The Leadership Program: Provides fun youth development activities to enhance our students’ participation in clubs and 
extended day. Through the Leadership Program, we have provided the Fordham Leadership Academy with the following 
clubs. These clubs afford students the opportunity to display their talents and focus their energy on positive interactions 
among themselves and their teachers.

Partnership with Children: This is our new mental health partner and will provide targeted and universal services to at-
risk students and their families as well as the attendance subgroups. 

 

Goals: The lead CBO in 2018-19 will continue the focus on student attendance and college and career readiness, as well 
as providing leadership opportunities for students. 

 

 

  What adult education offerings can your school community provide to families? 

In collaboration with school leaders and support staff, our community school partner will survey families to gather 
information of support and services parents may need. Examples of adult education offering may include GED classes, 
ENL classes, and computer classes; however we will plan additional offerings after surveying families. 

 

Working with CBO and their sub-partners, plan for Classes that will be offered to parents in 2018-19: 

 

❏ENL 

 

❏Basic Computer Skills (taught by a parent with this training) 

 

❏Beginning Word processing and spreadsheets 

 

❏GED class or at least the connection to a strong GED program for parents. 

 

 

 

  How would families be able to access and understand student data and progress? 

As mentioned earlier, the school employs “Pupil Path” grading system as a means of communication student progress 
data with parents. The school provides Pupil Path training to parents at Parent Teacher night, and also through the 
Parent Association. 

2017-18 RSCEP-ON                                                              

 

 

 71 

 

The school does provide Academic Policy and Graduation Requirements training for parents, but it is our goal to 
enhance attendance at these particular trainings and highlight perfect attendance and honor roll achievement 
celebrations, in order to ensure that parents are celebrated for their commitment to their children’s education. 

Teachers will continue to contact and meet with families to share and gather information about students. Guidance 
staff, School Leaders and teachers will collaborate to ensure that families are receiving support and the necessary 
resources 

We will continue to use our guidance suite to meet with parents/families. Community School staff will be housed in the 
suite as well, as this will afford further collaboration. 

We will continue to assign guidance counselors to all students. All families are informed as to who the guidance 
counselor is and how they reach them. Collaborative meetings will be conducted by school leaders, teacher and 
community school partnerships to introduce families to the newly formed partnerships and linkages which will provide 
support to students and their families, both academically and socially-emotionally. 

 

 

Within the Community School model, how will families be welcomed into the school and made a part of the school 
community?  What support will administrators, teachers, school staff and school safety officers be given to help create 
a welcoming environment?   Will there be a dedicated space for families in the school? 
 
A full time parent coordinator will continue to bridge families to our school community and make the needs of parents 
known to the school's leadership team to adequately provide the necessary supports. A welcoming environment is 
always a goal for famlies and students and all stakeholders work together to ensure this is a part of the culture of the 
school by collaborating on any challenges that may develop. 

 

 

 How will the school identify and develop families to take leadership roles in school decision making/school 
governance structures? 
 
Parents are always invited to the monthly PA meetings and encouraged to visit the school at any point to meet with 
staff about the well being of their children. Parent participation in focus groups will be encouraged and active 
organization and planning of events with the support of the parent coordinator will be a way to foster leadership among 
our parents. 

 

 
 

How will the school engage the community and families? How will they ensure that teachers are able to learn from 
families about the children being taught? 
Workshops and additional meetings after school will be created, in addition to required parent teacher conferences, to 
provide parents and teachers the time to discuss the needs and adequate supports for the children being taught. 

 

 

What types of supports does the school provide to families to encourage them to take an active role in what their 
child is learning?

Part 3 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools – Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be consistent with 
the expectations in part 2, responsive to the identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART – 
Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Meeting your SMART goal should directly impact 
meeting at least one of your Renewal Benchmarks and/or Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks. 
By June 2019, the school will create an aggressive engagement initiative, increasing the number of leadership 
opportunities for parents/guardians to initiate and/or support school-wide initiatives, resulting in a 5% increase in our

Section 6: Expanded Learning Time (ELT) Program Description  

 

Directions: Expanded Learning Time (ELT) activities are directly aligned to the elements of the Framework for Great 
Schools, Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environments, and Strong Family and Community Ties. ELT provides enriching 
educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship-
building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and 
extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring 
that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200 
additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of 
instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in 
grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced 
curriculum that can include ELA, math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development. Complete the sections 
on this page to demonstrate how the school will meet these requirements.  
 
Part 1 – ELT Program Goal(s) 

Describe the summative goal(s) of the ELT program for the 2018-19 school year. Goals for ELT should align to the 
Renewal Benchmarks.  How will the school will ensure that all students’ individual needs are served during the 
Renewal ELT and how the school’s vision for ELT will impact both academic achievement and social emotional 
growth? Be sure to construct the goal to be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
 

By June 2019, Fordham Leadership students participating in Extended Learning Time programs will show an increase 
in attendance minimum of 1%. This will be evidenced by: 

Teachers and students participating in programs such as, College Portfolio Class, College Now, Individualized 
Academic Intervention Services (AIS), AP Courses (English Language Arts, Environmental Science, US World History 
and Foreign Language), Double Periods of Grade 9 ELA and Mathematics, Yearbook Class, Online Blended Class and 
Leadership Advisory. 

College Portfolio Class will be offered Fall semester 2018 for Seniors and Spring semester 2019 for Juniors. This 
program will allow Fordham Leadership Academy students to organize and learn about the college application 
process, for example, essay writing, filling out applications, learning how to complete financial aid forms. The College 
Portfolio Class will be offered five times a week. 

College Now will continue offering college-level coursework to the students of Fordham Leadership Academy. This 
collaborative partnership will include at least 25% per grade. 

Individualized AIS will be implemented during the instructional day. Students are strategically placed in AIS program 
for either; help needed to pass a failed examination or extra support needed to pass a class. AIS intervention will be 
offered 3-5 times a week. 

AP Classes will continue throughout the 2016-2017 academic year. AP English will be offered to Grade 12 students, AP 
Environmental Science and Chemistry to Grade 11 and 12 students, as well as, AP Foreign Language to Grades 9-12th. 
These classes will meet 10 times weekly (5-Double Periods). 

Double Periods will continue for Grade 9 Mathematics and ELA coursework. This extension of time will helps lay the 
foundation for a successful high school career. Classes will meet 10 times weekly (5-Double Periods). 

Yearbook Class will continue for Grade 12 students during 2016-2017. The Yearbook Class will examine yearbook 
creation and publishing, for example, photography, organizing, editing. Participants will meet 5 times weekly.

Online Blended Class will be utilized to support student credit recovery in addition to test preparation. Students in 
need of additional support will have a teacher available to assist and advise. This class will occur 5 times weekly. 

Advisory Class will examine the social emotional concerns of adolescents; bullying, respect for all, establishing healthy 
relationships, coping and leadership skills. Advisory class will be held 5 times weekly.  

SAT Preparatory ,“Let’s Get Ready,” will be offered to students as an after-school/ Saturday program.  

Internships will be extended to students of Grades 10-12 during the 2016-2017 academic year. Experiential Learning 
will occur at least three times weekly. Students will be involved in collaborative partnerships with community based 
organizations, such as, Bronx Botanical Gardens, Albert Einstein, Bronx Community College and Capitol Bank. 

∙ Teachers will utilize technology programs such as Achieve 3000, Castle Learning, and Plato to provide additional 
academic support for Fordham Leadership’s population of diverse learners, inclusive of, English Language Learners,

Instructional materials, software programs and laptops will be utilized and upgrading of these resources considered. 

Scheduling for the Extended Learning Time will include extended AM or PM arrival/departure time for teachers as 
needed. The Extended Learning Time is built into the school day and gives us a nine period schedule, therefore 
students have the opportunity to take eight periods a day. 

 

Parental Engagement time is provided daily for one period per week minimally (50 minutes) or as needed. 

In addition, all teachers meet for Inquiry (2 periods of 50 min. per week).  

 

Our students receive an additional hour of instruction per day (credit bearing our AIS). In addition, all of our students 
receive extracurricular activities for an additional 2hrs (optional) from 4pm to 6pm. A select group of students receive 
ELT menu of extracurricular options beginning at 3pm (on track with all requirements). Teachers' schedules are 
staggered and include the additional minutes per day to support our PL schedule (dedicated weekly blocks of 
professional learning by content area) which provide teachers intensive PL and support on a weekly basis. To support 
this schedule teachers' daily schedules total 6 hrs. and 50 min.

Section 7: Community School Description  

Directions: The Community School program is directly aligned to the Framework for Great Schools element – Strong 
Family and Community Ties. 
 
Part 1 – The Community School Program Goal(s) 

Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School program for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct 
the goal to be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.  Meeting your SMART goal 
should directly impact meeting at least one of your Renewal Benchmarks and/or Demonstrable Improvement 
Benchmarks. 
The goal of the Community School Program in Fordham Leadership Academy is to support our school’s attendance 
plan to meet and exceed benchmarks set forth by the NYC DOE and the NY state; as well as to provide college and 
career readiness opportunities in the form of internships and college now courses on and off site. Our Community 
school partner will also support our school with expanded learning management of after school extracurricular 
activities. By June 2019, our Community school partner will have secured internship opportunities for at least 25% of 
our students and college now access for at least 25% of our Junior class and at least 25% of our Senior class.

Part 2b. Describe how the school will meet the NYCDOE requirements for a Community School in the School Renewal 
program. 
1. 

Renewal Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and together 
with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will lead 
implementation of the asset and needs  assessment process, and other critically important coordinating 
activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work. 
Renewal Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and 
services, as determined by the asset and needs  assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time 
(ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the 
right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly

coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day. 
Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to 
strengthen this initiative. 
Renewal Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and families 
feel welcome,  actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of their 
schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community 
School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this  family 
engagement strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Renewal School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use. 
Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work. 

The Principal, adminstrative cabinet, and CSD will continue to meet weekly to assess the needs of the school 
community and make adjustments to plans. The cabinet makes routine use of the NV data tool, ORS, and ATS reports 
during these meetings to guide conversations. The personalization in all of our programs is a key focus of our work 
and partnership and thus subcontracting organizations that place strong emphasis on this model is how we 
implement this work and with careful, data-driven monitoring of impact, via progress reports and DOE systems data, 
we make changes accordingly. 

The extension between home and school is critical for our success and how we have managed to increase student 
achievement over the past 3 years. Monthly PA meeting and CET committee meetings support this goal. The CSD 
works closely with the parent coordinator to engage parents and motivate them to participate. 

 

 
Part 3 – Community School Program Implementation and Oversight 

Part 3a. Key Staff and Partners 
1.  Name and describe the scope of involvement of all community partners working in the school (include partners 

supporting ELT, counseling, enrichment, etc.) 

2.  Name the members of your Community School Team and how meetings will be organized and structured to 

engage all stakeholders and be focused on results. 

3.  Explain data strategies including the use of the data sorter, and steps that the school will take to ensure that the 

appropriate interventions are provided to the right students 

 

Parents and caregivers are second only to FLA students with respect to the important role they will play in the CSP. To 
that end, adult utilization of program services and level of involvement in the host school will be closely tracked by 
CSP staff. Registration forms and attendance sheets will be maintained for each activity, e.g., workshops, chaperoning 
college tours and other volunteer activity, etc., for which parents and caregivers choose to enroll. Fordham University 
will look very closely at the periodic customer satisfaction surveys administered by the program. The input yielded by 
these documents will be used to drive the CSP's quality assurance and continuous program improvement activities. 
Anecdotal feedback provided by the FLA's Parent Association and Parent Coordinator will also figure prominently in 
the project evaluation process. Student participation in all expanded learning and enrichment activities will be 
reviewed, on a bi-weekly basis, to track utilization of these services. The CSP's Expanded Learning Director and 
Educational Specialist will take an active role in this portion of the project review process. These staff will meet with 
FLA teachers on a weekly basis to determine if student performance has improved for youth who participate in ELT 
activities. The report card grades and Regents grades and credit accumulation of these students will also be reviewed 
by project staff. 

School Evaluation Toolkit created by the Coalition for Community Schools and, 2) the "Effective Data Collection and 
Sharing" guidelines articulated in "Scaling the Community Schools Strategy in New York City." 

Our CSO will provide the following key personnel: Full-Time Director – on site; Data Specialist- on site.

Part 3b. Indicate resources needed including human resources, instructional resources, and schedule adjustments to 
implement the Community School program. 
The Community Schools Coordinator (CSC) will manage the program's day-to-day operation. This full-time employee 
will be permanently stationed at Fordham Leadership Academy and will have his/her own office in the building. One 
of the main roles of the CSC will be to serve as a liaison between all key stakeholders in the school community (e.g., 
students, parents, teachers, principal and external partners), Fordham University and the Department of Education. In 
their managerial capacity, this employee will assemble and preside over the Community Schools Team (CST) sub-
committee of FLA's School Leadership Team (SLT). Fordham University expects that the CSC will also be a sitting 
member of the building's SLT as well and attend all meetings held by that group. Dual membership in those two 
bodies is essential since it will provide the CSC with a complete, up-to-the-moment understanding of the FLA's needs 
and current status. The CSC will be expected to have regular (as in daily) dialogue with all constituents in the building. 
To ensure that the needs of all families are met, the CSC will work closely with the FLA's Parent Coordinator and 
Parent Association. To ensure that young people play an active role in the program's policy-making activities, the 
FLA's Student Government Association (SGA) will be asked to expand their scope of activities to encompass the CSP.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (RSCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/RSCEP.  

2017-18 RSCEP-ON                                                              

 

 

 93 

 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG or SIF funds: These funds 

must be used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant 
application.

Section 13: Parent Involvement Policy (PIP) and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Fordham Leadership Academy , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

Support for Parents and Families of Title I Students 
Fordham Leadership Academy will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

  providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, 

e.g., literacy, math and use of technology; 

  providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

 

decision making in support of the education of their children; 
fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 

  providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
 

sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and 
in languages that parents can understand; 

  providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and 
other members of the school community; 

 

Parent Involvement and School Quality 

2017-18 RSCEP-ON                                                              

 

 

 95 

 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school. 

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

 

actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of 
the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

  Title I Priority and Focus Schools and the parents of students served in the Title I program must jointly agree 
upon the use of these additional funds to support increased parent engagement/education to enable parents 
to effectively support their child’s learning. 

  engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 

directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

  ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 

 

strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing 
technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills; 

  maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

 

  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

  host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise 

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right 
to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 
and other applicable sections under the ESSA; 
schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the 
Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed; 
conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Our total population is approximately 400 of which 74 are English Language Learners. Our ENL 
population in not progressing in Regents passing rates. We have targeted Entering, Emerging, 
Transitioning and Expanding students who are in need of supplementary support in English 
Language Arts and subject content areas instruction. These students have been found lacking in 
basic phonic skills that impact their success rate in content areas classrooms. With 
supplementary instruction and the increased usage and development of comprehension skills, we 
will increase reading and writing proficiency with our ENL students. Students will attend classes 
during our After School Program on Wednesdays from 3:30-4:30 and our Saturday Academy 
from 10:00-1:00 on Saturdays. The programs will begin on 9/18 and run weekly for 25 sessions. 
The block on Wednesdays will be split into 2, 30  minute sections; 1) Using content that will 
support work students are doing in school during the day as a means to build Language 
Acquisition skills, 2) Regents Review and preparation across various content areas. The 
knowledge and skills acquired in during the After School Programs for ENLs, will promote their 
academic growth and will afford students valuable small group and individual time with 
experienced educators. Moreover, the skills and knowledge obtained will carry over into the 
regular school day, thereby enhancing each participant’s success. 
All teachers are certified ENL teachers, or, bilingual certified. 
  
Students will be grouped in small groups. 45 minutes will be based on level. The other will be 
based on grade/ content need. Grade levels are 
9- 10 students 
10- 10 students 
11- 10 students 
12- 10 students

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Curriculum based assessments: Teacher created, content specific, with an emphasis on regents aligned essays. A structure for 
writing, TIEPD, is being used as a checklist/scaffold as well as accompanying graphic organizers. 
Students are being assessed on these essays/graphic organizers, so that scaffolds can be minimized across the year. 
Based on student proficiency levels, instructional supports are being planned by ENL staff in conjunction with content area 
teachers to support ENL success. 
From the data obtained, we can analyze whether a student is below reading level or on reading level. Collecting and analyzing 
this data helps our school's instructional plan by assisting in identifying areas of poor performance and allowed us to focus on 
the effective reading strategies that would support individual students into reaching more advanced literacy levels.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2017-18 RSCEP-ON                                                              

 

 

 106 

 

 

Weekly department meetings where we analyze the organizers/scaffolding and norm assessment tasks and rubrics. 
Graphic organizers, plans, tasks, are shared across grades and departments via google drive. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 
 
Students are given a WITSI baseline assessment in their ELA class which is shared and assessed by content teachers. 
Students are given additional WITSI tasks throughout the year. 
A second, final baseline is given at the end of the year for comparative purposes. 
Student areas of need are discovered and the WITSI tasks throughout the year are aligned to those areas of need. 
 
 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Through our WITSi inquiry meetings we are able to measure student’s progress and address areas of need.  This is supported 
in both ELA co-taught classes and reinforced in ENL stand-alone classes. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Paste response to question here:  Not Applicable  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
 
 
We currently use the RLat tool from ATS to help us evaluate and inform us of our student language proficiency levels, we also 
use the most current student’s Regents exams,  their scores and levels assist us with programing the students to get the most 
support  in their classes. 
 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

We currently have department meetings were we study data from RLAT, Regents scores using EDAT spreadsheets to target 
each of our students and through discussion and analysis we program and make adjustments whenever necessary. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

a. Freestanding program are for entering students needing the required minutes of instruction. Additional minutes 
are met via integrated setting in Global History and Mathematics. 
b. The models utilized are self-contained, integrated (co-teaching) and stand alone.  
c. Homogeneous (proficiency level is the same in one class regardless of grade level).  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Our Freestanding ENL students are provided with the mandatory 540 minutes per week for Entering, 360 minutes per week for 
Emerging and Transitioning and 180 minutes per week for Expanding. The Commanding students are also receiving integrated 
services in content classes. The goal and objective of the program are to develop verbal and written fluency in English, to 
develop listening, speaking, reading and writing skills in English, to improve scores in the reading and writing modalities on the 
NYSESLAT assessment and to increase ELLs’ scores in all content areas as measured by the city and state exams. The ENL 
program will be effective by maintaining consistency in content area learning with the focus on literacy and language 
development. The mandated language instruction for ENL will comply with Part 154 of the Commissioner’s regulations. 
Language instruction will be aligned to the ENL and ELA learning standards and the Common Core State Standards. We do not 
offer NLA.     
          
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
The overarching philosophy of our ENL program targets the LAP 6 content area of instruction. Each term ENL students are 
placed in general content area classes (mathematics, science, social studies and English) and the ESL teacher “pushs-in" to 
offer ESL strategies for academic remediation and support in an integrated setting. There is one ELA class for 9th graders that 
follow the stand alone model. The teachers meet and plan during Common Planning Time (CPT). The native language support 
offered in content areas are cognates and peer tutoring with other students who speak their language.     
   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

They are given HLIS to ascertain their skills in the acquisition of the Language. The evaluation is done only in English.    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 
a. SIFE students are given diagnostic testing in the English and Spanish if that is the native language. They have individual goals 
and benchmark. We have developed mastery learning where they assigned projects based on different tasks that are aligned 
with the CCSS. They have portfolios and once they have mastery of a skill, they move to the next and can pick up wherever 
they leave off. 
b. The newcomers are assigned Freestanding ENL class, Push-in and Pull-out models. They are assisted by the ENL teacher in 
content area subjects such as science and ELA. 
c. The students with 4 to 6 years are given a Integrated ENL/ ELA class. The ENL teacher assists in science or ELA. They have 
dictionaries and content glossaries. 
d. The long-term ELLs are given a Integrated/ co-teaching classes in ELA. 
e. Former ELLs are given mainstream content courses, they are given time extensions during local and state examinations, and 
are provided with dictionaries and/ or content glossaries.

with the age level but the proficiency levels. The Entering are assigned 540 minutes per week, Emerging 360 minutes, 
Transitioning are assigned 180 minutes per week, Expanding are assigned 180 minutes per week, and Commanding are 
assigned 90 minutes per week. Each level contains students with various ages but the same ability.While students are grouped 
heterogeneously, instruction in all classes is differentiated for each specific student’s language performance level. 
 
 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
 ELLs will  have access to glossaries in their native language.  They have promethean boards and bright link boards that also 
have interactive software that teachers use to provide visual and audio support for better understanding of the lessons.

Training is provided to the teachers with strategies to use in the regular classroom to service the needs of ELL students to 
utilize strategies such as graphic organizers, t-charts, visual scaffolding, interactive read alouds, etc. Once the hours of the 
training is completed, a certificate is issued. Professional Development given in-house are placed in a PD Binder with sign-in 
and agendas. 
ENL teachers will receive 50% of professional development provided in-house, through CBOs and Office of ENL.   
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
 
Individual annual meetings are scheduled at the beginning of the school year for the parent of each ENL student to come in 
and discuss specific information of the program and services the school provides.  The natural language development process 
and how we will align students as they make progress.  The various kinds of language proficiency assessments will be discussed 
and how other formative assessments are incorporated in order to measure language development and acquisition in all 
content areas.  During each of these meetings, parents are provide with a fluent interpreter and/or translator in order to 
conduct an effective discussion. All questions and comments are addressed to ensure full understanding of the information 
discussed at the meeting.  Parents are also asked to volunteer any information that they may believe is relevant in order to 
assist further the language acquisition process of their child.  This may be related to cultural practices that may be aligned as a 
cognate to the building of everyday use vocabulary.  ENL coordinator will keep all logs of meetings.   
 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

All parents are sent an invitation letter and contacted by phone to invite them to meet ELL Support Team and to receive 
information of the program conducted in the school. Ample time allocations are made so that there is time for both parties to 
share information on the child. Based on this discussion and the previous information obtained from the child's portfolio, an 
action plan is proposed. Each parent is fully knowledgeable of the services that will be provided to their children the school 
and they are asked to also support their child in language acquisition by following some effective strategies of exposure to 
English language learning at home. During the course of the school year, each parent is invited to be updated on the progress 
made by their child. Parents are made aware of any modifications made to the action plan according to frequent assessments 
made by the teacher and the team.

Policy and Reference Guide, I, Fiorella Cabrejos, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

When a student is enrolled into our school whether through List Notice or Over the Counter, the Home Language 
Survey is administered by our Assistant Principal, Ms. Crooks. Our current data indicates that our parents are 
predominantly English and/or Spanish speaking and so all correspondence, letters, flyers, conversations and 
messages are given in both Spanish and English. Whenever we have meetings we provide translation by our 
Parent Liaison and occasionally from the Translation Unit of the Department of Education.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

send out the message in Spanish to the limited English proficient families.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

During Chancelleor's conference day in September, staff is provided with a professional development on the 
procedures that take place to identify students who are English Language Learners. Once students are identified from 
the HLIS survey then students are given the NYSESTILL exam to determine their proficiency level. Students are given 
the required number of minutes of ENL instruction which may include stand alone classes and/or push-in classes with 
the content-area teacher receiving support from the ENL teacher. In addition, on the PD day, teachers will be given 
strategies to support and differentiate instruction for ENL students in the classroom.

Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

The school has provided a visual map of parents' bill of rights in the main office and a guide to language access 
available as well in varying parts of the building. All offices also use a self-created map of key words for 
communicating with parents of Spanish speaking background and those of the low incident languages.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Every month, our PA meeting conducts surveys to gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of 
services. Our school invites all parents to attend our PA meetings and attendance does not go below 30 families to 
date.
