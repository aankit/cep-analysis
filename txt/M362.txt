Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          6 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

Columbia Secondary School for Math, Science and Education was created in 2007 as a partnership between the 
Department of Education and Columbia University. It is a selective school that gives preference to districts 3, 4, 5 and 
6, which were the communities impacted by the expansion of Columbia University into Northern Manhattan. Our 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 

diversity is shaped by the districts that we serve, and our mission is to offer the students of these districts, who are 
under served by other screened and specialized high schools, an equivalent level of rigor and opportunity.  

 

 

 

  

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Columbia Secondary School is one of many new schools to focus on science, technology, engineering and math 
(STEM). What sets us apart is how we try to find a balance between “left-brain” and “right-brain” in our curriculum. 
Two unique courses that we have developed explore what happens when right brain and left brain meet and have to 
cooperate. 

 

Columbia Secondary School is the only public school in New York City to require seven years of both Engineering and 
Philosophy. The engineering curriculum teaches teamwork, conceptual development and problem solving. The 
Philosophy program helps students develop critical thinking, argument, moral reasoning, and decision-making skills. In 
2016 our students published their second annual philosophy journal, CONTRARIWISE, featuring students’ original 
work on philosophical topics. The publisher who was contracted to print the journal was so taken by it that he 
requested permission to display it at a book fair that he was attending in Seattle. The journal is now available on 
Amazon for purchase. American Educator, the AFT education journal, has solicited an article on our Philosophy 
curriculum, which it intends to publish in the spring edition of the magazine. Articles about the curriculum have also 
appeared on ChalkBeat and PLATO, the website devoted to Philosophy education. 

 

Our Engineering program has also been an area of intense focus and development. After experimenting with the 
Project Lead the Way sequence, we struck out on our own, with advice and support from engineers who are parents 
in our school, and faculty members at the School of Engineering at CU. Siemens Corporation, who employs one of our 
parents, subsidized his salary for the 2018-19 school year to work with us on defining what makes a strong pre-
engineering curriculum and what skills and characteristics it should develop in students. Our current sequence is 
based on the input we received from these faculty and engineer consultants. Starting in 6 th grade, it exposes 
students to the mechanisms and concepts important to engineers and immerses them in projects that lead them to 
explore what makes things work - and fail. While still under development, we have strong hopes that this will be a 
powerful and innovative curriculum that gives a true pre-engineering experience to students. 

 

Lastly, our 7-year span of time creates long-term relationships between students and teachers that are fostered by 
out-of-school-time programs. Our after school program, known at Columbia Secondary School as “the Electives”, is a 
huge part of the relationship-building between students and teachers. Every spring and fall, teachers, parents, and 
other community members (sometimes faculty from CU), design courses that interest them, and in which they think 
students will also be interested. Offerings range from a variety of sports to arts programs to academic courses such as 
Architecture, bird watching, Neuroscience for middle school students and underwater robotics, to name just a few 
offerings. The courses are published each semester in a catalog, much like a college catalog, and students choose 
those that interest them. We have close to 80% participation from our student body in these courses, and interacting 
with teachers, parents and community members in areas of mutual interest creates a less-formal interaction that 
builds relationships among students, teachers and parents. Through this program, students continue to interact with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

teachers for long periods of time, even though they may no longer have scheduled courses with those teachers. Some 
of the college recommendations written for our students last year were informed by these relationships, and by 
seeing students develop over time, from a brink-of-childhood 6 th grader to a brink-of-adulthood senior.  

 

A distinguishing characteristic of Columbia Secondary School is the diversity of its community. In the design of our 
curriculum and pedagogy, we work to include multiple perspectives and pedagogical strategies that appeal to 
different kinds of learners. Common in our school are pedagogical practices that deliberately move between more 
teacher-directed lessons that are common in the freshman-level university courses that our students have the 
opportunity to take at Columbia University, and more student-led exploration, to build independence, engagement 
and persistence. Some examples of this approach follow. 

Our school’s curricular sequence is designed with multiple entry points in mind. Building Philosophy and Engineering 
into every year, as well as Art and Language, provides opportunities for interdisciplinary reinforcement and hands-on 
applications of more traditional topics that our strongly collaborative staff take advantage of on a regular basis. In 
middle school engineering, for example, students build boats to discover how the shape affects the amount of weight 
the boat can carry, connecting with their science class’ study of density and mass. A sewing project in art class leads to 
connecting the study of electrical circuits in engineering to sewing with conductive threads to create “sewn circuits” 
that generate enough electricity to create fabric with electrical features. Math is regularly brought into middle school 
art, in designing a cover for a baseball, in scale and proportion, and in fractional measures. By high school, students 
are exploring coding and using it to build elementary robotics components, using geometry to trace the path of 
movement for their robots, as well as building a practical application of physics.  

 

In the humanities, too, teachers work to emphasize connections among the disciplines to give students many 
opportunities to practice analysis, discussion of and writing about complex ideas and texts in multiple contexts. In 
middle school, philosophy class is an opportunity to explore philosophical implications of literature, or to debate 
current issues, connecting to both ELA and Social Studies classes. While reading Ender’s Game in 7 th grade ELA class, 
a recent discussion in philosophy examined concepts of “smart” and “good”. In 8 th grade, the students are currently 
reading articles from various perspectives around gun control, preparing for a debate and examining arguments. Later 
this fall, as they begin to look at the events at the Constitutional Congress in the 8 th Grade US History class, they will 
read passages from Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau to explore the philosophers who influenced the founders of our 
country. By ninth grade, they will be exploring rhetoric and logic in philosophy while being introduced to Euclidean 
proof in Geometry. These connections are not random – they are the result of sustained and collaborative planning 
among teacher teams to find connections that serve to reinforce multiple disciplines without watering any of them 
down. 

 

Within courses, we find ways to develop multiple entry points for students. This year in middle school, we initiated a 
math lab period. This period is scheduled during the same period on every grade level, so students can be reorganized 
into groups in multiple ways. In the 8th grade, we are piloting the Bootstrap program, which uses coding to reinforce 
Algebra concepts and skills, during the math lab period, and in science classes, teachers frequently move back and 
forth between text-based instruction and experimentation. Every middle school student is programmed for an after-
school academic reinforcement period. Teachers structure the groups based on student strengths and weaknesses 
and use the time to deliver more personalized instruction and reinforcement. High school, too, includes increased 
periods of instruction for more opportunities for support in class, along with deliberately scheduled double periods in

University, reducing class time and increasing support for those who have not yet demonstrated readiness for 
university-level courses. 

 

Our key areas of focus for the 2018-19 school year include continuing to work to develop strong 7-year curricular 
sequences that incrementally build student capacity and lead to significant accomplishments and high levels of 
performance; increasing student and parent awareness of characteristics that lead to success in order to increase our 
level of mastery in course grades; further building on our culture of collaboration to increase the percent of students 
qualifying for courses at the college level; continuing to support leadership activities of teachers, students and parents 
to achieve an increase in participation; and increase student and parent participation in community events and 
community action projects.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We are intentionally a secondary school, and, early on, there was a deliberate choice made not to join the specialized 
screening process for the high school. This has resulted in a much higher level of diversity in our school, and also in a 
greater range of academic ability. It has also adversely affected our funding, as the specialized schools receive a 
supplement to their budgets. With the challenges, there is also opportunity. One group of students that we hang on 
to are 8 th grade students who were high performers in 6 th grade, but whose scores have dipped by the 8 th grade. 
They would not necessarily pass the screens of other high schools, but in committing to all of our students, regardless 
of academic level, we demonstrate that a single year’s scores don’t have to adversely affect future opportunities. Our 
aspiration is to keep alive in all our students a sense of their early potential and motivate and support their increasing 
achievement through high school. We tend to have little attrition through high school, and an oddly non-competitive 
vibe for a rigorously academic school. Though a 6-12 model is extremely difficult to administer logistically, given the 
different school calendars, assessment schedules and evaluation formulas, the model has shaped our approach to 
curriculum, instruction and social development.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
 

While we continue to work to refine and improve our curriculum and pedagogy, our students have demonstrated 
strong achievement in a variety of ways that show the strength of our instructional core and the effectiveness of the 
action planning that resulted in improvements over the course of the year: 

  We saw significant improvements in math results, including: 

· 95% of our 8 th grade students passed the Common Core Learning Standards Algebra Regents in 
2018, and 54% received mastery scores of 85 or over, an increase of 12% over 2017. 

· 94% of our students passed the Common Core Learning Standards Geometry Regents in 2018, an 
increase of 2% over 2017, and 42 % of them received mastery scores, an increase of 12% over 2017. 

· 92% of our students passed the Algebra/Trig Regents, and 31% received mastery. This is our first 
administration of the new CCLS exam, so we do not have comparisons to previous years.. 

· In United States History, we maintained a passing rate of 93% for our 8th and 11th grade test takers, but increased 
mastery by 5% , to 68%. 

· In Earth Science, we saw a 6% rise is passing, to 96% and a 17% rise in mastery, to 70%. 

· In Living Environment, we increased our mastery by 2%, to 78%. 

· Our 9th Grade Adjusted Credit Accumulation for former 8th Grade Students is 100%. 

· Approximately 85% of our 8th grade students continue with us into high school. 

· Our Weighted Regents Pass Rate is at the high end of our peer range (90% or over) for English Language Arts, Math, 
and United States History, and at 60% of our Peer Range for Global and Science. 

· 92% of our graduating class had completed college-level coursework before graduating. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

· Our high school graduation rate in 2018 was 99%. 

· 100% of our graduates had post-secondary acceptances. 

· The combined average Scholastic Aptitude Test scores of our 2018 graduates was in the top 5% of high schools 
citywide. 

· Our Aspiration Performance Measure was 83%, higher than 93% of city schools. No school with demographics similar 
to ours had higher achievement. 

 

For 2015-16, our academic trends put us at an Effective or Highly Effective measure, as documented in the School 
Quality Reports published by the New York City Department of Education.  

 

These results depict a year of progress that shows the strengths of our school, and the effectiveness of the plans 
developed by members of the School Leadership Team working collaboratively. Though as measured by the national 
assessment of educational Progress, and, as mentioned in the overview, there is a dip in proficiency from the 6th to 8th 
grade, in Columbia Secondary School, we did not see a dip in proficiency in math between the 6th – 7th grades and all 
students passed the Algebra Regents in 8th grade, which is an increase in proficiency from their 6th grade scores. In 
English Language Arts, we saw a slight dip between the 6th and 7th grade English Language Arts scores, from 90% 
proficiency in 6th grade to 88.8% proficiency in 7th grade. From 7th to 8th grade, there was an increase in proficiency, 
from 73.9% proficiency in 7th grade to 89.2% in 8th grade. This year, we will continue much of what was effective over 
the last year to increase academic achievement of students in our school, and add a focus on community building and 
targeted intervention for students in our school. These adjustments are reflected in our Comprehensive Education 
Plan goals and action plans, below. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
 

Over the 2018-19 school year, to better align our 7-year course sequences in the humanities and STEM to the CCLS 
and associated assessments, thereby increasing their state test scores by 5%, as measured by the scaled scores 
distributed by the State Education Dept, by the end of the 2018-19 school year.

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for this 
Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

In ongoing Circular 6 meetings, to identify performance objectives 
that are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards, and 
that reflect the course content and grade level, and to create 
curriculum maps that detail an appropriate progression of texts 
and course materials and that describe essential questions, 
targeted skills and proficiencies and benchmark assessments that 
define student progress, proficiency and mastery expectations in 
the context of the course and grade level. (teachers, coaches, 
Assistant Principals). Circular 6 refers to the professional periods 
negotiated by the United Federation of Teachers, which is the 
union representing teachers in the city of New York. The Circular 
6 memo, which outlines the intent and allowed uses of this 
period, can be viewed here: 
http://www.uft.org/files/attachments/professional-activities-

o To develop a set of shared writing rubrics that are aligned to the 
Common Core Learning Standards and associated performance 
objectives and that reflect the vertical and horizontal 
development of increasingly complex writing tasks in order to 
better assess student progress towards mastery.  

o to use these common assessments (every five weeks) and 
scholarship data (every six weeks) to assess progress and to 
predict performance of students in coursework and on 
standardized assessments and target as necessary for 
intervention 

o To integrate into the core sequences study-skills-based 
scaffolding and a balance of guided and independent assessments 
which support students performing at a wide range of proficiency 
and/or mastery levels. 

o Incorporate questions into lesson plans that address at least 
three levels of inquiry – from more concrete to more analytical 
and/or evaluative - to improve student responses

o Increasing the number of extended writing assignments and the 
frequency of feedback. 

For struggling students, fostering strong student engagement by 
including student-interest-driven text choices in each unit, 
increasing frequency of feedback for writing assignments and 
incrementally building to extended writing assignments, reflecting 
increasing complexity as students progress from one grade to the 
next. 

To continue to develop and increase the range of opportunities 
for students to apply learning in out-of-classroom settings and in

Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 

Part  4a.  Indicate  resources  you will  leverage  to  achieve  this  annual  goal  and  implement this  action  plan,  including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 

As a non-Title I* school with the lowest per student funding in the district, and one that is not funded at 100% 
of our Fair Student Funding target, as defined by the New York City Department of education, we have few 
resources to leverage. To learn more about Fair Student Funding, as well as the funding methodology for New 
York City Public Schools, you can visit http://schools.nyc.gov/AboutUs/funding/overview/default.htm. Our 
action plans take the funding constraints we experience into account by utilizing time built into the day and 
relying on teacher professional work periods to carry forward our plans. Other ways we make our dollars 
stretch include schedule adjustments requesting minimum to no per session for supervisors and working with 
Community based Organization to supplement our program. These efforts are largely supported by the Tax 
Levy funding that comprises the majority of our Fair Student Funding Allocation.as well as New York State 
Textbook Law funding for resources and materials such as textbooks and classroom supplies. According to "A 
Guide to NYC Public Schools Budget", Tax Levy comes from local taxes, including property taxes, personal 
income tax, and sales tax.  
 
* Title I, according to the United State Department of Education website, refers to Title I, Part A (Title I) of 
the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, as amended (ESEA) provides financial assistance to local 
educational agencies (LEAs) and schools with high numbers or high percentages of children from low-
income families to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
 

A distinguishing characteristic of Columbia Secondary School is the diversity of its community. In the design of our 
curriculum and pedagogy, we work to include multiple perspectives and pedagogical strategies that appeal to 
different kinds of learners. Common in our school are pedagogical practices that deliberately move between more 
teacher-directed lessons that are common in the freshman-level university courses that our students have the 
opportunity to take at Columbia University, and more student-led exploration, to build independence, engagement 
and persistence. Some examples of this approach follow. 

Over the last three years, building a school culture has been a constant area of focus. Expectations are communicated 
every day in the classroom, and our work has been to ensure that there is an alignment among staff and common 
message communicated to students about what high-level performance is and how to achieve it. The work of our 
teacher teams helps to bring a more consistent view among our staff of what high-level work should look like across a 
grade, so that students also gain a consistent perspective on what “A” work looks like. 

 

Beyond the teacher teams, we have worked to increase our communication to parents and students around academic 
and socio-emotional norms and expectations. Some of the structures we have put in place over the last year or two 
include: 

- Curriculum nights for parents at the beginning of each year to familiarize parents with the curriculum, assessment 
schedule and course sequence of the school. 

- Exposing students and parents to college- and high-school readiness standards. Some of the tools and structures we 
have developed to help communicate this are: 

o The Columbia Secondary School diploma requirements, which extend beyond the state diploma and 
increase expectations for student study in the disciplines, as well as require at least one college-level 
course credit before graduation. 

o Developing, with Columbia University, a course catalog of 72 courses available for our students to 
take, and using these as benchmarks for aspirational performance for our students. 

o Establishing a rubric that details criteria for success in coursework in order to be considered for 
entry into a Columbia University course, and familiarizing students and parents with the rubric and 
application process through parent nights, assemblies, and classroom visits from the counselors.

o Creating a National Honor Society chapter and having members push into middle school classes to 
model and support increased student achievement. 

o Inviting students who have National Honor Society potential to National Honor Society events to 
expose them to benefits and criteria of membership. 

o Creating course sequences with minimal tracking – all students take all courses, including advanced 
and accelerated courses. 

o Using advisory periods in middle school to set goals and review academic progress 

o Having mandatory academic support periods after school for middle school students 

o Our annual 9 th -grader-for-a-day for 8 th grade students, to expose them to our 9 th grade 
environment. 

- Cultural events and field trips that include exposing students to high-level academic and/or authentic work-place 
experiences also serve to model and convey high expectations to our students and parents. Some of these include: 

o Hispano-American and Black History months, in which, in addition to an evening of cultural 
celebration, we invite lecturers to the school who discuss issues relevant to the Hispano-American or 
African-American experience. Students and parents are invited to attend these lectures during their 
lunch periods. 

o Family Science night, during which we invite partner organizations, such as zoos and museums, to 
develop participatory activities for our parents an students. Our teachers and upperclassmen also 
develop activities designed to showcase their work in science class during the year. 

o Philosophy Roundtables, which are initially facilitated by the high school philosophy teacher and, by 
the end of the year, student-led, to which we invite parents and students to discuss texts that 
students have been reading in class.  

o Field trips to farms to explore sustainable agriculture techniques, which is a theme which runs 
through our 6 th grade curriculum, or to Frost Valley to explore how water filters from upstate NY to 
NYC and to interact with museum docents and staff at the Aqueduct. 

 

In addition to the work we do around finding structures and experiences to support a culture of high expectations, we 
have a fully developed college office that regularly provides outreach and support to parents and students to expose 
them regularly to college-level expectations. Our college office increases student and family awareness through a 
number of structures and events, including: 

o Monthly college nights for parents and students focusing on college information for parents. College 
nights might be focused around financial aid, or early awareness, or a variety of topics to help guide 
students and families through the college preparedness and application process. 

o Annual college fairs and pre-college fairs. 

o Weekly lunch meetings for students with admissions representatives from a wide variety of colleges 
from across the country.

o Individual conferences for students and parents of all 12th grade students, with a focus on college 
matching, essay development and the application process. 

o Grade-wide college trips for 11th grade students to familiarize them with different college 
environments and increase their exposure. 

o This year, we are initiating our first Alumni Day, during which our recent graduates have agreed to 
return to discuss their experiences at college with our 8th and 9th grade students. 

We have also been developing a growing number of internships and opportunities to increase, on the high school 
level, the exposure to authentic experiences. Some of these opportunities include: 

o Internships during the summer for Columbia University Facilities Department 

o Working with graduate students in the School of Engineering at CU to develop original research 

o Internships with Harlem’s new BioSpace Lab 

o Internships with the Neuroscience program at the Mind, Brain, Body Institute at CU to learn 
fundamental techniques of neuroscience research 

o Working with mentors from the School of Engineering at CU to help build a Robotics First team at 
Columbia Secondary School. 

Lastly, our teachers, too, have opportunities to model high expectations. Through our partnership with Columbia, 
Columbia Secondary School teachers are eligible to take one course per semester tuition-free, and many of our 
teachers use this opportunity to increase their own content knowledge and/or gain new skills. Courses teachers have 
taken that have resulted in offerings to students at Columbia Secondary School include Latin, Programming, Statistics 
and Shakespearean Literature. 

 

Some ways that we can measure the impact of our communication of high expectations include: 

o Increasing qualification for, and success in, college-level courses at Columbia University (in our first 
year, we had a group of 23 students in courses at CU. This year, we have doubled that number. In last 
year’s graduating class, 45% of the students had successfully completed coursework at CU, and 92% 
of them had completed some college-level coursework)  

o 80 – 85% of our middle school students choose to stay with us for high school. 

o As noted earlier, our Scholastic Aptitude Test scores and Aspiration Performance Measure are in the 
top 5 – 7 % in the city, our graduation rate is 98%, and our college acceptance rate is at 100%. 

o Every student applied to multiple colleges and had a range of acceptances from which to choose. 
87% of our students chose 4-year colleges, either public or private, and 12% chose two-year colleges. 
One student joined the Army. Acceptances ranged from Ivy League universities to community 
colleges.

grading and character-based report cards 

o Review findings from researchers from Teachers College who are working 
with some of our high school science students to examine the attitudes of the 
students towards success in science. 

o Measuring student attitudes towards success – we will work on this in two 
ways this year. One is with a group of researchers from teachers college who 
are working with some of our high school science students to examine the 
attitudes of the students towards success in science. Another is a pilot in the 
8th grade, where they are instituting “character report cards” to define and 
measure characteristics such as “grit” and gratitude”. We are still collecting 
data with these efforts, but it will give us a way to better understand and 
address issues of academic performance and social-emotional perception.

Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 
Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
As a non-Title I* school with the lowest per student funding in the district, and one that is not funded at 100% of our 
Fair Student Funding target, as defined by the New York City Department of education, we have few resources to 
leverage. To learn more about Fair Student Funding, as well as the funding methodology for New York City Public 
Schools, you can visit http://schools.nyc.gov/AboutUs/funding/overview/default.htm. Our action plans take the 
funding constraints we experience into account by utilizing time built into the day and relying on teacher professional 
work periods to carry forward our plans. Other ways we make our dollars stretch include schedule adjustments 
requesting minimum to no per session for supervisors and working with Community Based Organization and our 
Parent-Teacher Association to supplement our program. These efforts are largely supported by the Tax Levy funding 
that comprises the majority of our Fair Student Funding Allocation.as well as New York State Textbook Law funding 
for resources and materials such as textbooks and classroom supplies. According to "A Guide to NYC Public Schools 
Budget", Tax Levy comes from local taxes, including property taxes, personal income tax, and sales tax.  

 

* Title I, according to the United State Department of Education website, refers to Title I, Part A (Title I) of the 
Elementary and Secondary Education Act, as amended (ESEA) provides financial assistance to local educational 
agencies (LEAs) and schools with high numbers or high percentages of children from low-income families to help 
ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

There is ongoing and collaborative work around aligning standards, curricula and assessments. Closely tied to our 
focus on Questioning and Discussion is how the complex ideas raised in class are reflected in the tasks we ask our 
students to do on a daily basis, and in how and what we assess, on an ongoing basis, in end-of unit and end-of term 
assessments, and in externally-developed standardized assessments. The work of our department teams is centered 
around defining what we teach, how we assess what we teach, and how we can use these assessments to make some 
determination of our effect on student achievement. 

 

● The English Language Arts department worked over the course of last year’s inquiry cycle to examine the prompts 
and resulting student work on each grade level, and reviewing the work both from the perspectives of the Common 
Core Learning Standards and AP Literature expectations. As a result of this work, they produced a draft document 
outlining benchmark text and writing expectations from 6 th to 12 th grades. This was then reviewed with the Social 
Studies department lead teacher to create consistent expectations in student writing development in the school. In 
response to their findings, this year, the English Language Arts team has spent the first months adjusting curricular 
objectives and better defining writing and reading assessments by grade level. Based on our Regents and Scholastic 
Aptitude Test results, we have been successful in building strong capacity in our students. Our new target is moving 
more students into range of successful performance on the AP Literature exam. 

 

● An ongoing discussion in the science department has been what development of science skills looks like over a 
seven-year period when the course content and Regents assessments are relatively disconnected from each other. 
Unlike other subjects, which build from year to year, science suffers from a silo effect – how does taking Earth Science 
prepare you for Biology or Biology for Chemistry? Even the licensing is different for each course, unlike the other 
disciplines. It takes some ingenuity to find a developmental thread in this odd situation, but our science department 
has worked steadily to find a scientifically meaningful response to this problem. In reviewing the New Generation 
Science Standards and Common Core Learning Standards, they found connections between the idea of argument and 
experiment, and gaps in the state curriculum where it comes to review and analysis of scientific writing. They decided 
to work this year to develop units incorporating argument into each science course, with an eye to finding authentic 
journal articles that students might review and analyze. They have just reviewed the first task from a 9 th grade class. 
In light of their findings, they are working to develop a rubric tied to the New Generation Science Standards that 
defines scientific argument (hypothesis, experiment design, data gathering, conclusion) to better specify expectations 
on each grade level. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          26 

 

 

● The Engineering departments have been working to design and redesign our engineering course sequence. After an 
enormously productive year working out what engineer needs to know and do, and drafting a rubric that defines skill, 
concept and knowledge expectations across seven years, they are redesigning tasks for the middle and high school 
engineering courses, and spent the most recent Professional Development day working out how to assess a student’s 
level of innovation when designing an engineering solution to a given problem. 

 

● The essential work of the math department is to find those pedagogical and curricular strategies that increase 
achievement at higher levels of math for more students. One way that we are working towards this is identifying 
areas of struggle for students and methodically addressing each one to try to find a better way to teach and explain it. 
An example is division by zero. A typical explanation at the middle school level is that division by zero is impossible. 
That explanation closes the door to thinking about the nature of zero and division, and is not mathematically 
accurate. However, it does not interfere with fluency. One of the shifts in the Common Core Learning Standards is to 
find those explanations that don’t interfere with fluency, but increase conceptual understanding. In other words, find 
a better way to explain to middle school students what division represents, and what is problematic about division by 
zero. The Math Department has worked together over the past two years to better address this shift towards 
conceptual depth, as well as mechanical fluency. They have worked to revise units and assessments to try to develop 
those items that test conceptual understanding as well as procedural fluency. This year, they have a double task, to 
understand and implement the new Geometry curriculum, which is a huge content shift from past practice and 
curricula, and to continue their work on assessment review. Most recently, they have been working to gather 
assessments across all grade levels to determine if we are assessing all the Common Core Learning Standards 
mathematical practices on a regular basis, or whether we ignore some and emphasize others. Compared to our peer 
group, we are moving students relatively well in math, but remain dissatisfied with our Trig Regents results, and 
continue to work to find ways to bring more students to higher levels in math.  

 

● Much like the science department, the Social Studies team has the problem that the standard curriculum and 
assessments do not define a development of “social studies” skills from Global History to United States History, or 
from middle school to high school. The document analysis and thematic essay in one exam does not reflect a higher 
level of critical thinking or analysis than the other. The teachers are left to work out what the arc of development of a 
social studies student should be over the seven years of instruction at Columbia Secondary School without much 
guidance from the available standardized curriculum or assessments. Last year, the work of the social studies team 
roughly paralleled that of the English Language Arts team, with analysis of prompts, tasks and student writing. 
Although this inquiry cycle was productive in creating a better alignment of what writing benchmarks to set, they still 
needed to define what essential ideas and content to develop writing assignments around so that they pushed the 
students to better analysis and understanding of historical context each year. With the publishing of the new NY State 
scope and sequence and the national College, Career and Civic Life curriculum, the social studies team has been 
working this year to solidify the main developmental objectives for our students in order to better align their 
assessments vertically. Our Regents results in United States History have been strong relative to our peers, even 
though we test students in the 8 th grade. For our Global results, we are working towards a higher level of mastery. 

 

● In Foreign Language, we regularly outperform city, state and national averages on AP and Languages Other Than 
English assessments. However, the Spanish Department continues to review and refine its work to improve student 
performance. A focus last year, after a review of student work on end-of-unit assessments, was to look at the role of 
cognates in student understanding. After analyzing a variety of assessments, the team realized that students often

mistranslated cognates, and especially false cognates. After revising instruction to explicitly address the 
misunderstandings, student results measurably improved across all subgroups.  

 

The focus on the use of rubrics and review of student work also informs ongoing formative assessment in the 
classroom and aids in helping students build capacity to self-assess and peer-assess. Teachers use a variety of 
techniques for ongoing assessment, including exit slips, homework checks, use of student writing as exemplars and 
use of student test analysis to build understanding of expectations, notebook checks, classroom questioning, student 
surveys and conferencing.  

 

This ongoing professional work across all departments is an integral part of the professional culture at our school. To 
inform their work, teachers review curricular materials from city, state and national sources, consult with faculty from 
Columbia University, parents and partners from community organizations. Teachers here strive to find multiple ways 
to assess their own effectiveness in order to move students to higher levels of achievement. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
In order to reflect the commitment that teachers have to the success and improvement of their classrooms and of CSS, 
our goal is to build on the work of the teacher teams over the 2018-19 school year to increase by 10% the number of 
students prepared for CU-level classes.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for this 
Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

In ongoing Circular 6 meetings, to identify performance objectives 
that are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards, and 
that reflect the course content and grade level, and to create 
curriculum maps that detail an appropriate progression of texts 
and course materials and that describe essential questions, 
targeted skills and proficiencies and benchmark assessments that 
define student progress, proficiency and mastery expectations in 
the context of the course and grade level. (teachers, coaches, 
Assistant Principals). Circular 6 refers to the professional periods 
negotiated by the United Federation of Teachers, which is the 
union representing teachers in the city of New York. The Circular 
6 memo, which outlines the intent and allowed uses of this 
period, can be viewed here: 
http://www.uft.org/files/attachments/professional-activities-
manual.pdf. 

o To develop a set of shared writing rubrics that are aligned to the 
Common Core Learning Standards and associated performance 
objectives and that reflect the vertical and horizontal 
development of increasingly complex writing tasks in order to 
better assess student progress towards mastery. (teachers, 
coaches, Assistant Principals) 

o to use these common assessments (every five weeks) and 
scholarship data (every six weeks) to assess progress and to 
predict performance of students in coursework and on 
standardized assessments and target as necessary for 
intervention 

o To integrate into the core sequences study-skills-based 
scaffolding and a balance of guided and independent assessments 
which support students performing at a wide range of proficiency 
and/or mastery levels. 

Incorporate questions into lesson plans that address at least three 
levels of inquiry – from more concrete to more analytical and/or 
evaluative - to improve student responses

As a non-Title I* school with the lowest per student funding in the district, and one that is not funded at 100% of our 
Fair Student Funding target, as defined by the New York City Department of education, we have few resources to 
leverage. To learn more about Fair Student Funding, as well as the funding methodology for New York City Public 
Schools, you can visit http://schools.nyc.gov/AboutUs/funding/overview/default.htm. Our action plans take the 
funding constraints we experience into account by utilizing time built into the day and relying on teacher professional 
work periods to carry forward our plans. Other ways we make our dollars stretch include schedule adjustments 
requesting minimum to no per session for supervisors and working with Community Based Organization and our 
Parent-Teacher Association to supplement our program. These efforts are largely supported by the Tax Levy funding 
that comprises the majority of our Fair Student Funding Allocation.as well as New York State Textbook Law funding

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

According to The Framework of Great Schools, effective school leadership is described as a principal who sets the 
tone for the school, develops a climate of inclusiveness, and inspires staff and students with a clear vision for student 
achievement. The goal of a strong school leader is to build coherent instructional and social-emotional support that 
improves student achievement. School leaders support teacher development by consistently offering professional 
development opportunities and providing meaningful feedback. They seek input through regular meetings with all 
members of the community. 

 

At Columbia Secondary School, as described in other sections of this document, these qualities are in evidence. 
Sections 1, 2 and 3 describe work in the school around creating a coherent and rigorous instructional program, to 
develop social-emotional supports, and to structure and encourage effective teacher collaboration that supports 
increased student achievement. In order to develop leadership on all levels, school leaders have developed structures 
and strategies to support distributed leadership and to foster innovative and effective techniques in and out of the 
classroom. Some of these strategies and structures are described in the following paragraphs 

 

Teacher teams and distributive leadership are supported by various structures at Columbia Secondary School. Our 
basic organization is the following: 

 

Professional development time is, with the exception of a few positions, entirely devoted to team work and co-
planning. Each department has a team leader, either supported by a comp time position or per session. Each grade 
level also has a grade-level leader. Teachers belong to a grade-level team and a department team. Grade-level teams 
and department teams meet in alternate weeks. The schedule for meetings is posted on a shared Google document 
available to the entire faculty. 

 

In alternate weeks, administrators meet with grade-level team leaders and department team leaders. During these 
meetings, team leaders share work and also provide feedback about department and/or grade-level needs. In this 
way, professional development needs are identified. For example, the agenda for the Nov 8 th Professional 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32 

 

Development Day was agreed on and workshops developed to meet the prioritized needs expressed by supervisors 
and team leaders, with input from department and grade-level team members.  

 

Each administrator also has areas of supervision. The principal oversees English Language Arts and Math; one 
Assistant Principal oversees Science, Engineering, Foreign Language and middle school grade teams, and the other 
Assistant Principal oversees Social Studies, Art, Physical Education and high school grade teams. Before department 
meetings, supervisors meet with department team leaders to develop and refine agendas. Supervisors also 
participate in team meetings, though as a member and not as the team leader. 

 

By working collaboratively with supervisors, teacher team leaders can influence and help shape the professional work 
of the school while maintaining a coherent direction towards common school goals. 

 

As noted above, department teams review various forms of data to determine the effectiveness of their approach, as 
well as to identify patterns of need and strength. In grade-level meetings, teachers review anecdotal data, and 
progress data from the web-based grade system to determine the composition of after-school intervention groups, to 
schedule meetings with parents and to develop any grade-wide parent and student communications. 

 

In the School Leadership Team, we review data periodically to form a basis for developing our goals and action plan. 
Data that we review includes school scholarship, standardized test scores, budget and facilities data, among others. 

 

Parents and students have leadership roles in the school beyond the School Leadership Team. The principal meets 
with parents in various configurations a minimum of three times a month, and often five or six times. The School 
Leadership Team, the Parent Teacher Association, breakfasts with the Principal, curriculum nights, and the fund 
raising arm known as the Friends of Columbia Secondary School are some of the opportunities to gather information 
and feedback from parents. Students met regularly with the Coordinator Of Student Activities for middle and high 
school, and form a backbone of volunteerism and activism in the school. Most recently, students and parents have 
also become active in the community, presenting projects for our local City Council member as part of the 
Participatory Budget project for the city. Several student- and parent-generated projects have been approved for 
further review by the Council, and one of our parents has been tapped as a facilitator to help other in the district 
develop projects. In the school, parents and students have influenced courses selections, started sports teams and 
initiated yearly events which have become rituals. 

 

 

Finally, our non-pedagogue staff have strong ownership of school goals and show leadership towards meeting them. 
Though there are many examples, one that is compelling is our college counselor, who single-handedly created the 
college office, and has conceived and generated annual events that have become part of the culture of Columbia 
Secondary School, including a yearly pre-college fair, open to all district schools, to which she invites various 
organization that host summer and pre-college programs that may appeal to middle- through high-school-aged 
students. She has also organized a yearly career day for our students, and, this year, is working on our first Alumni 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33 

 

Day, when our graduates will return on their winter break to talk to our underclassmen about their first semester at 
college. 

 

The unofficial slogan of Columbia Secondary School is “We build Columbia Secondary School together.” This has 
manifested itself in many ways – in the initiative taken by teachers, staff, parents and students to generate and 
implement school-improvement ideas, in the volunteerism and fund raising that helps us fund our programs, in our 
after-school program offerings that show you can have fun and learn at the same time, to the sports teams that spring 
up, each year bringing a new city championship runoff. This school is full of leaders, all working together to enrich and 
support our community. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
In order to nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, our goal is, over the 2018-19 school year, to continue 
to achieve a 10% increase in development of teacher professional development offerings that meet teacher needs as 
measured by survey results..

We have worked to increase our communication to parents and students around academic and socio-emotional 
norms and expectations. Some of the structures we have put in place over the last year or two include: 

- Curriculum nights for parents at the beginning of each year to familiarize parents with the curriculum, assessment 
schedule and course sequence of the school. 

- Exposing students and parents to college- and high-school readiness standards. Some of the tools and structures we 
have developed to help communicate this are: 

o The Columbia Secondary School diploma requirements, which extend beyond the state diploma and 
increase expectations for student study in the disciplines, as well as require at least one college-level 
course credit before graduation. 

o Developing, with Columbia University, a course catalog of 72 courses available for our students to 
take, and using these as benchmarks for aspirational performance for our students. 

o Establishing a rubric that details criteria for success in coursework in order to be considered for 
entry into a Columbia University course, and familiarizing students and parents with the rubric and 
application process through parent nights, assemblies, and classroom visits from the counselors. 

o Creating a National Honor Society chapter and having members push into middle school classes to 
model and support increased student achievement. 

o Inviting students who have National Honor Society potential to National Honor Society events to 
expose them to benefits and criteria of membership. 

o Creating course sequences with minimal tracking – all students take all courses, including advanced 
and accelerated courses. 

o Using advisory periods in middle school to set goals and review academic progress 

o Having mandatory academic support periods after school for middle school students 

o Our annual 9 th -grader-for-a-day for 8 th grade students, to expose them to our 9 th grade 
environment.

- Cultural events and field trips that include exposing students to high-level academic and/or authentic work-place 
experiences also serve to model and convey high expectations to our students and parents. Some of these include: 

o Hispano-American and Black History months, in which, in addition to an evening of cultural 
celebration, we invite lecturers to the school who discuss issues relevant to the Hispano-American or 
African-American experience. Students and parents are invited to attend these lectures during their 
lunch periods. 

o Family Science night, during which we invite partner organizations, such as zoos and museums, to 
develop participatory activities for our parents and students. Our teachers and upperclassmen also 
develop activities designed to showcase their work in science class during the year. 

o Philosophy Roundtables, which are initially facilitated by the high school philosophy teacher and, by 
the end of the year, student-led, to which we invite parents and students to discuss texts that 
students have been reading in class.  

o Field trips to farms to explore sustainable agriculture techniques, which is a theme which runs 
through our 6 th grade curriculum, or to Frost Valley to explore how water filters from upstate New 
York to New York City and to interact with museum docents and staff at the Aqueduct. 

 

In addition to the work we do around finding structures and experiences to support a culture of high expectations, we 
have a fully developed college office that regularly provides outreach and support to parents and students to expose 
them regularly to college-level expectations. Our college office increases student and family awareness through a 
number of structures and events, including: 

o Monthly college nights for parents and students focusing on college information for parents. College 
nights might be focused around financial aid, or early awareness, or a variety of topics to help guide 
students and families through the college preparedness and application process. 

o Annual college fairs and pre-college fairs. 

o Weekly lunch meetings for students with admissions representatives from a wide variety of colleges 
from across the country. 

o Individual conferences for students and parents of all 12th grade students, with a focus on college 
matching, essay development and the application process. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
In order to bring resources from the community into the Columbia Secondary School building and to continue to 
develop partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations, our goal is, over the 2016-17 
school year, to increase participation in community action projects and events described in the action plan, below, by 
5%.

Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 

Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 

 

As a non-Title I* school with the lowest per student funding in the district, and one that is not funded at 100% of our 
Fair Student Funding target, as defined by the New York City Department of education, we have few resources to 
leverage. To learn more about Fair Student Funding, as well as the funding methodology for New York City Public 
Schools, you can visit http://schools.nyc.gov/AboutUs/funding/overview/default.htm. Our action plans take the 
funding constraints we experience into account by utilizing time built into the day and relying on teacher professional 
work periods to carry forward our plans. Other ways we make our dollars stretch include schedule adjustments 
requesting minimum to no per session for supervisors and working with Community Based Organization and our 
Parent-Teacher Association to supplement our program. These efforts are largely supported by the Tax Levy funding 
that comprises the majority of our Fair Student Funding Allocation.as well as New York State Textbook Law funding

for resources and materials such as textbooks and classroom supplies. According to "A Guide to NYC Public Schools 
Budget", Tax Levy comes from local taxes, including property taxes, personal income tax, and sales tax.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Columbia Secondary School in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part 
A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy 
to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

Columbia Secondary School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 
● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 
decision making in support of the education of their children; 
● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 
● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 
● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 
 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 
● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the 
school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies 
as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical 
support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  
● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of 
the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming 
and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for 
parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support 
services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  
● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 
● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents 
of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be 
involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other 
applicable sections under the Elementary and Secondary Act; 
● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the 
Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  
● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our school uses teacher assessments, baseline writing and math assesments and analysis of state tests to assess the literacy 
and math skills of our students.  As reflected above, our students perform at or above grade level on these assessments and 
typically quickly test out of the ELL system.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Team planning is the basis of our assessment development and analysis structure. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The effectiveness of our program is based on the success of our students' performances on a variety of measures, including 
state tests, the NYSESLAT and teacher-generated coursework, assessments and grades.   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Our PPT Team performs a needs assessment and determines appropriate interventions. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Paste response to question here: N/A  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Our student results show proficiency and/or mastery of state examinations and classwork.  The one ELL student is at a level of 
expanding. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

We disseminate information through presentation ns at parent meetings, curriculum nights, and other community 
gatherings.  We also utilize email and newsletters as forms of communication. 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Columbia Secondary School has a screened program.  One of the entrance requirements of the screen is proficiency 
or mastery of the ELA and math state tests.  We have few ELLs - to date.   Because a stand-alone program is not 
feasible in this situation, our program consists of supplementary support for our ELLs, both within the school day 
through push-in and small group work, and outside the school day in tutorial and mentoring support.  Our ELLs are 
heterogeneously grouped with the non-ELL population, and they use the grade-level and/or accelerated materials 
that the general population uses.  Their state test scores, see chart below, tend to be equivalent to their classmates' 
scores. We have an integrated Free Standing ENL instruction where we build English skills through the content 
area.  Our ENL program is departmentalized and English language development is included all content area subjects. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

              Our students are categorized as Advanced, so are mandated to receive 180 minutes per week in support.  We provide 
this support through push-in services, and have an ESL teacher who pushes in to the 6th grade ELA classes in order to provide 
support.  ELA classes last 45 minutes, so over the course of the week, four push-in periods supply 180 minutes of 
support.  Students are also given support in their native language by bilingual staff members.  The student has tested at or 
above grade level in state tests and are, accordingly, given the grade-level materials that are appropriate for their level of 
performance.  Our one student is a newcomer and is provided extra instructional time through supplemental ESL periods, and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

individual tutoring. Both students receive targeted support provided by the ESL teacher.  Since we are a 6-12 school, the needs 
of the student may vary depending on the grade level.  As well, the level of the student is taken into consideration, if the 
student is entering or emerging they will need 360 minutes, if the student is transitioning or expanding they will need 180 
minutes per week.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
      Classrooms are print-rich, employing word walls, in-class libraries and publicizing students work. As per CR Part 154, the 
native language is used 25% of the time to access students’ transferable skills. Academic rigor is valued and expected.  Our 
teachers also provide support using the five learning standards and performance indicators to assess understanding of reading, 
writing, listening, and speaking.  The learning standards are used in collaboration with the content teachers and the ENL/ESL 
teacher to provide self-monitoring strategies and incorporate knowledge and skills from earlier grade levels into performance 
indicators of higher grade levels.  To also capitalize on the linguisic and cultural diversity of the student, to expand on explicit 
nonverbal and paralinguistic features of communication and utilize the students' native language. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

      Content area teachers are given support and materials to scaffold content for ELLs. Examples of these supports include 
leveled content texts, word walls, native language texts and alternative assessments. ESL teachers also provide information 
about cultural differences and learning styles of ELLs. Teachers have common planning time to discuss students, student data 
and strategies for success.  Small group tutorials are programmed and matched to facilitate specific content needs. All students 
take electives in content-rich and experiential art classes.  Effectiveness of instruction is assessed by classroom instruments, 
teacher and student self-assessments as well as standardized tests such as the State ELA and subject area exams, the subject 
area Regents and the NYSESLAT, all of which are addressed explicitly through test item prep lessons and a general “test 
sophisticated” classroom culture. Teachers use Datacation and ARIS to access program-wide data on student performance. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

As stated above, our ELL population is very low and the few ELLs we have had are typically long term and usually test out 
shortly after admittance.  Newcomer, Developing, Long Term and SIFE students are all assessed for proficiency in english 
language arts.  Their proficiency level determines how we differentiate instruction for all of our subgroups- ELLs and 
SpEd.   Teachers have common planning time to discuss students, student data and strategies for success.  Small group 
tutorials are programmed and matched to facilitate specific content needs. All students take electives in content-rich and 
experiential art classes.  Effectiveness of instruction is assessed by classroom instruments, teacher and student self-
assessments as well as standardized tests such as the State ELA and subject area exams, the subject area Regents and the 
NYSESLAT, all of which are addressed explicitly through test item prep lessons and a general “test sophisticated” classroom 
culture. Teachers use Datacation and ARIS to access program-wide data on student performance.  Differentiation is across 
content areas focusing on the writing process, understanding how to organizefacts,details, illustrative examples and 
distinguish between fact and opinion.  Convey information and ideas through spoken and written language.  As well, 
understanding how to analyze, synthesize and present information as well as consulting print and nonprint resources (in native 
language if necessary). 
Former ELLs will still receive at least one half of one unit of studey of English (90 minutes), testing accommodations as well as 
support services from the ESL teacher in the content areas.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

We base instruction primarily on grade-level State Standards and differentiate among ELL subgroups according to English 
proficiency level, academic preparedness and years of service. All lessons are differentiated through teacher-student 
conferences, graphic organizers, leveled texts, use of the native language and alternative assessments.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Programming at CSS always uses the least restrictive environment as we do not have self-contain classes or separate locations 
for ELLs or IEP students.  Due to our cohort sizes and limited class space,  all classes are integrated and content area teachers 
are given support and materials to scaffold content for ELLs and to identify instructional materials, including technology, that 
support ELLs and all our learners. Examples of these supports include leveled content texts, word walls, native language texts 
and alternative assessments. ESL teachers also provide information about cultural differences and learning styles of ELLs.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
ELA Targets are based on NYS ESL learning standards, all other content areas (math, science, social studies) are based on 
CCLS.  Teachers have common planning time to discuss students, student data and strategies for success.  After school and 
supplemental services include small group tutorials which are programmed and matched to facilitate specific content needs 
and provide support in the native language if necessary.  All students take electives in content-rich and experiential art 
classes.  Effectiveness of instruction is assessed by classroom instruments, teacher and student self-assessments as well as 
standardized tests such as the State ELA and subject area exams, the subject area Regents and the NYSESLAT.  As stated above, 
teachers modify and or scaffold curriculum to tailor the needs of the ELL or IEP students.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Our ELL population is relatively low, and as stated above, our ELLs are usually at the advanced level.  Any improvements would 
be across all subgroups, to also service our IEP population.  Our SETSS staff and ESL/ENL teacher are working closely this year 
to incorporate ELA strategies throughout the content areas.  Our focus this year is incorporating more writing, analyzing and 
synthesizing text and understanding/interpreting illustration.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We are not discontinuing any services to any subgroup.   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 Since ELLs are fully integrated within their grade, school programs and supplemental services are open to all student 
subgroups.  Teachers encourage all students to participate in after school programs (such as credit bearing electives for HS, 
plays, sports, and tutoring).  Our after school programming in middle school includes outside support from the YMCA-SONYC 
program which has a mandated homework help period followed by an elective of choice.  In HS, our teachers lead the credit-
bearing elective courses which include, but not limited to: Math & ELA tutoring, yearbook, newspaper, musical, 
band/chorus,  science exploration (Environmental Science), National Honor Society and Greenteam/sustainability.  In addition 
to the electives and after school tutoring, students also participate in clubs.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Technology is infused in all classes, teachers use smartboards in all classes (content areas).  Computer lab is programmed in all 
students schedules so they have access to computers and printers.  If necessary, the technician will provide native language 
material to assist the student.  Teachers also use computer based programs to give homework and input grades.  Students are 
instructed how to access online instructional materials as well as support if needed.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Families are surveyed at the start of the school as to their preferred language of correspondence.  In addition, students are 
also frequently surveyed as to their preferred language.  Since our school uses the ENL model, teachers will provide the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

additional materials if requested by the student.  As stated above, our students typically do not request home language 
integrated within their curriculum and are able to perform with the use of English as their main language for instruction and 
any additional support services. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

As all of our ELLs are performing at or above grade level, targeted intervention is not as much a focus as general strategies that 
serve to allow entry points for various types of learners.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Technology is infused in all classes, teachers use smartboards in all classes (content areas).  Computer lab is programmed in all 
students schedules so they have access to computers and printers.  If necessary, the technician will provide native language 
material to assist the student.  Teachers also use computer based programs to give homework and input grades.  Students are 
instructed how to access online instructional materials as well as support if needed.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Since our school has a very rich co curricular programming, students are encouraged to participate and volunteer for open 
school night, school dances, open houses and student performances.  We also try to “buddy” the newly enrolled student with 
an older student who can serve as a peer mentor.  Our ELLs and other subgroups (IEP) are fully integrated in their grade and 
encouraged to participate in all activities.    
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

spanish and latin  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Paste response to question here:    
Paste response to question here:    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Paste response to question here:    
Five 50-minute professional development sessions will be devoted to ELL services. ESL teachers will meet with content-area 
teachers during daily team planning time to assist them in planning, delivery of instruction and assessment. All teachers and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

administrators serving ELLs will participate in regional professional development offerings, such as how to administer the 
NYSELAT and techniques on differentiating instruction and aligning ELL instruction with State Standards. All content teachers 
will be trained to develop a college-going culture for ELLs as well as general education students that will begin in 6th grade, as 
students transition from elementary school. Implementation and effectiveness of professional development will be assessed 
by classroom observation by administration and coaches, as well as self-reflection. The ESL teacher will turn-key the training 
listed above to English and content area teachers, as well as secretaries and the parent coordinator in five 1-hour workshops. 
These workshops will be held the Monday after each training session. Professional development will be effected throughout 
the school community.  
  
Our ESL teacher plans weekly with content area teachers, assistant principals and principal to build their capacity in ensuring 
the rigor of content  delivery while building entry points for students such as sentence-startes, organizational tools, language 
analysis and reading strategies.  These weekly sessions last 45 minutes, resulting in 225 monthly minutes of teacher and staff 
training. 
  
Our support staff, such as the guidance counselor, office staff and parent coordinator, participate in twice-yearly, half-day 
workshops offered by the network and/or centrally.  The guidance counselor os also trained in transition needs and routines as 
our students transition from middle school to high school.  We do not have a graduating class.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Teacher teams meet regularly to discuss student progress, as such, in the case with our subgroups, parents are invited to come 
in annually to discuss student progress.  In some cases, the meetings may be held twice, once in the fall and once in the 
spring.  Traditionally,  we conduct our meetings depending on the need/progress of the child, based on performance, if the 
child is doing well, parents are invited in the early spring, prior to the Parent Teacher Conference.  If the child is struggling at 
the start of the new year, parents are invited earlier in the fall, usually mid-November.  Translation services are provided if the 
parent request, as our parent coordinator is the facilitator for interpretation/translation services.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Parent involvement includes inviting parents to our extra curricular activities; parents volunteer for dances, bake sales, student 
performances, sports events and our cultural activities.  The parent coordinator works closely with the COSA to reach out to all 
families and provide multiple translations of the correspondence for the families.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Miriam Nightengale, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.
