Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

We are a small 6-12th-grade college preparatory school dedicated to the belief that all students can, must and will 
learn and succeed academically. We set high standards for each of our students and help them meet these 
standards by providing personal attention, a strong sense of community, high-quality instruction and engaging and 
innovative learning experiences inside and outside of the classroom. Students, staff, families and community 
members see themselves as part of a team whose main goal is the success of every individual student in our 
diverse learning community. We have a school-wide commitment to promoting social justice and combating 
racism, sexism, homophobia, classism and any other form of discrimination. The goal of the school is to create a 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

community of highly skilled students, lifetime learners, critical thinkers and socially responsible citizens who, upon 
graduation, will be prepared to succeed in college and beyond and positively impact their communities. 

 

 
  

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
East Side’s Common Core Understandings and Practices, that support the Common Core literacy shift, are that every 
classroom is a Common Core classroom. The teaching and practice of close reading and non-fiction writing, speaking 
& debating, and struggling and thinking is done across the curriculum and every teacher is responsible for and 
benefits from this work.  

All teachers commit to making sure students do a close reading of complex/grade level text weekly, write Claim 
Evidence Reasoning (CERs) or equivalent (high-ratio/non-scaffolded) non-fiction writing a minimum of 1 x a week, 
discuss and debate using text-based evidence and Habits of Mind on a very regular basis , think & struggle every day ( 
Ratio -the students must be doing the work)make time for Newsela in their classroom/curriculum. 

The curriculum aims to promote student independence and agency by evaluating their own writing development 
across the year. It also exposes students to apprentice their writing from exemplar texts that model sophisticated, 
grade-level writing in argumentative, narrative, and expository writing. We are using this work to revise the middle 
school ELA portfolio. Each English team has an English-focused learning specialist who helps students with disabilities, 
ELLs and other struggling students gain access to the curriculum and find success meeting the standards. They are 
part of the planning team and provide team teaching, small group, push-in, enrichment and skills classes, and an array 
of other support services. One of the best ways that our English students access the curriculum and find success and 
engagement in English class and build confidence as readers of complex texts and develop as strong writers using 
text-based evidence is through our independent reading program. The heart of the school’s literacy curriculum is 
independent reading. In the grades 6-10 block-scheduled English classes, students participate in 30 minutes of 
independent reading every day. In the 11th and 12th grades single-period English classes, students read for about 60 
minutes in class each week. Students are expected to read approximately 40 books each year (about 25 in 11th and 
12th) and the English team has developed consistent routines and rituals to support student choice, enjoyment, and 
plans to complete a range of appealing and complex texts. Over the years students have attributed this program to 
having the most significant impact on their development as readers. The independent reading program is bolstered by 
the full-time librarian & school library that has a robust collection along with the Principal's support. In particular, he 
maintains a library in his office and hosts book clubs open to any student across the school. By providing students 
with the choice, time and space to read we have been able to turn most students on to reading, creating a very 
positive relationship with books and reading that we have leveraged to help students enter and climb the staircase of 
text complexity. 

 

The release of the Common Core Instructional Shifts in Mathematics validated and reinforced the work our 
Mathematics Vertical Team has been rigorously engaged in over the past ten years. Throughout this time, Application 
has always been at the heart of our project-based curriculum. Almost every unit of study culminates in a rigorous 
project through which our students creatively apply mathematics concepts in a meaningful context. In addition to 
these unit projects (which we call exhibitions), we also assess understanding through unit tests and final exams at the 
end of each semester. This extensive combination of assessments demonstrates our commitment to the Dual 
Intensity shift. We believe in the importance of extended applications, while recognizing that they are not a 
replacement for on-demand tasks that assess specific mathematical concepts and Fluency . Our teachers are 
committed to devoting the time needed to implement this thorough combination of assessments. This underscores 
our belief in a Focused curriculum that values depth over breadth. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

 

The main focus of the work of the Math Vertical Team has centered around promoting Deep Understanding . We are 
constantly challenging ourselves to “break open lessons” by refraining from asking leading questions and removing 
just the right amount of scaffolding to ensure that our students need to think deeply and critically to complete the 
tasks we present. We believe that students learn best when they are engaged in a productive struggle to solve non-
routine problems and construct meaning. 

 

Our talented team of middle and high school mathematics teachers are engaged in a continuous dialogue focused 
curriculum and pedagogy. This allows us to develop and implement a Coherent 6th through 12th grade curriculum. 
We know that deep and flexible understanding of mathematics develops over time. This necessitates the spiralling of 
content throughout each year and subsequent years. We also believe that although many of our students have gaps 
in their understanding, this must not prevent us from continually exposing our students to new and interesting 
concepts. Our math teachers like to say that we help our students “fill potholes as they pave new roads”. 

 

Our students with learning disabilities are provided with extensive support to help them understand mathematics. We 
have learning specialists who focus on mathematics instruction and do so in no more than two grades. These 
specialists co-plan with teachers and co-teach lessons to ensure that our students with learning disabilities are 
engaged in a differentiated curriculum that meets their needs and that they receive individualized attention. Our 
math learning specialists also teach small enrichment classes to students who need it. During these enrichment 
classes, the specialists pre-teach concepts, help students solidify understandings, and provide small group instruction 
focused on identified learning gaps. 

 

In addition to working with the CCLS standards, the science revised the Science Portfolio Matrix to align with the Next 
Generation Science Standards. In particular the inquiry vs. engineering practices were more clearly defined. 
Experimental design, analyzing results, and sources of error were combined into the Inquiry matrix box. The previous 
“Technology” box was enhanced to include Engineering. Both of these alignments have lead to shifts in how teachers 
design labs and exhibitions that both build into the PBAT skills or fulfill portfolio requirements. 

 

Learning Specialists meet both within their content area vertical teams and with each other as Learning Specialists in 
their own vertical team. The purpose of this is to ensure that Learning Specialists are able to give full input in 
curriculum creation and delivery. This is critical in order to guide the refinement of academic tasks for all students to 
be able to access the CCLS. Teachers took part in Inclusive Classrooms trainings through TC which aided in the 
understanding of differentiation not as lessening rigor but as allowing various entry points for different types of 
learners. 

 

Our focused enrichment literacy, math, science classes greatly help to deepen understanding, provide individualized 
support, and build skills that allow students to access higher level thinking tasks while our Wilson, Rewards and basic 
reading skills classes help our most struggling readers in building fluency and comprehension skills. Our math 
enrichment classes focus on re-teaching material taught in their core math class in order for students to be able to 
learn the content in a more individualized manner, while building on the fundamentals of CCLS in mathematics.

Roundtables: 

At East Side, our strong focus on ratio expects students to practice high levels of thinking and participation. Rigorous 
dialogue focused on interesting and complex ideas is crucial in every class. We believe that it is critical not only to 
practice this, but also to to assess our students in these authentic contexts. Our students do this formally through our 
roundtable presentations. At the end of each semester, our students engage in rountable presentations for every core 
subject. Students present to an East Side teacher they currently don’t have and often an outside educator guest (we 
have hundreds come to roundtables each year). This process challenges students to demonstrate a deep and flexible 
understanding of the material. It also forces students to own their learning and provides the opportunity to reflect 
upon their learning process. 

 

Portfolios: 

As mentioned earlier, in all four of our content areas, East Side students are expected to complete graduation 
portfolios whose matrices have been aligned to the CCLS and appropriate content learning standards. The matrices, 
content and acceptable standard of work is all determined collaboratively by vertical teams. These portfolios 
demonstrate achievement and growth over time by representing work from throughout the students’ middle or high 
school careers. 

 

Performance-Based Assessment Tasks (PBATs) 

Being a member of the New York Performance Standards Consortium, East Side students complete PBATs as a 

replacement for the Regents Exams (other than the ELA). For history, students write a 10-20 page research paper and 
present and defend their thesis. For science, students design and conduct an original experiment and present their 
findings. For math, students complete and present an extensive project applying mathematics. For all subjects, the 
committee is comprised of multiple educators (oftentimes college professors or teachers from other schools). 

 

The history, science and math vertical teams each collaborate to build a cohesive curriculum building toward the 
PBAT. Teachers within each vertical team evaluate the PBATs together and discuss gaps in students performance. 
Adjustments in the curriculum are continually made to address deficiencies and build upon strengths. 

 

Moderation Studies: 

Each year, East Side teachers share samples of their PBATs with the Consortium. Through the moderation studies, 
groups of teachers from a variety of Consortium schools get together and evaluate PBATs and discuss their 
evaluations. This process gives us great insight into how our students compare to those of other schools and pushes 
us all toward greater inter-rater reliability. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12 

 

28% of our students have IEPs of whom the vast majority receive Team Teaching support in the classroom providing 
them with small group instruction and accommodations. Their specific needs are many and vary from student to 
student. Needs include support in areas where basic skills need to be taught or re-taught in terms of background 
knowledge for specific content areas, writing mechanics, verbal and written expression, fluency, comprehension, 
decoding, math fundamentals, memory retention and organization. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

When our principal first introduced our staff to the Framework for Great Schools they thought it was something we 
created to highlight the work we do because it is so in accordance to and in the spirit of all we do and value. Every 
aspect of the Framework for Great Schools truly feels like it is customized to fit our school. In addition, data from our 
most recent Learning Environment Survey captures this. As far as the most progress, we believe that student 
achievement in regard to graduation rates is where we have progressed the most. This year we had over a 95% 
graduation rate, which was our highest ever.  

 

However, it still does not fully capture the many amazing things that are put in place.  

  Our roundtables, portfolios, PBATs and thoughtful curriculum ensure rigorous instruction and authentic 

assessment of and reflection on student achievement. 

  The advisory system, small classes, extensive counseling services, extra curricular activities and partnerships 

too numerous to name create an extremely supportive environment. We were highlighted in a 20 page article 
titled Learning by Heart: Six American High Schools Where Social and Emotional Learning Are Core by 
Kathleen Cushman

05-4-14.pdf  

  Our common planning time, professional learning groups, extended staff development, teacher teams, UbD 
days and various systems that not just expect, but create space and time for collaboration make this a school 
teachers seek out to work at for our collaborative teaching 

  Our principal, who has been at our school for 17 years as the principal and 24 years in total, along with our 

three assistant principals, who have been at the school for 40 years combined, partnered with the strong 
leadership of our teachers and staff provides and inspires extremely effective leadership 

  Our advisory system, incredible parent coordinator, strong SLT and Parent Association, extremely high 

expectations for family support and involvement, and our various community partners create and secure 
strong family and community ties 

 

We are highly committed to diversity and making sure that over 62% of our students are Title I students receiving free 
lunch and over 25% of our students have IEPS. We are proud that we have hundreds of students from all backgrounds 
applying to be part of our community. . We believe this is a result of many of the programs listed above and a 
constant commitment to valuing all kinds of diversity and each student as an individual.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Honestly, we feel very strong in all areas of the framework, as evidenced by our strong ratings in all areas and unique 
initiatives and work listed above. We are very proud of the fact that our curriculum and classes are extremely rigorous 
and that our Learning Environment Survey results for Rigorous Instruction were 4.37, .83 above the district average 
and .79 above the city average 

 

We are very proud to be a Culture of Reading Showcase School and the winner of The Library of Congress American 
Prize Literacy Award. We are also proud that in each content area, students engage in short, long, informal, and 
formal writing activities throughout the week. Most units of study in these areas culminate in a performance-based 
assessment task that incorporates writing.  

 

As we are a member of the New York State Performance Standards Consortium and a portfolio-based school, teachers 
expect students to write frequently. The frequency of writing in each content area means that students are improving 
their skills, especially those aligned with the Common Core standards: Writing a range of argumentative, informative, 
and narrative texts that is coherent, well organized, and that presents complex ideas with necessary details. Often, 
their written pieces feature substantive issues of their choosing and are presented before an audience of peers, other 
teachers, and outside guests. We know that these skills will support their college and career readiness. 

 

While the frequency of writing is remarkable, we know that we could improve the way that we coordinate our 
delivery of writing instruction. It is necessary for teachers to share the writing instruction that they employ across 
each grade level and in each content area team. 

  

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15 

 

We aim to coordinate school-wide writing efforts to help students develop a growth mindset around writing resulting in 
improved writing across the school. This goal includes the following activities: 

 

Graduation rates will continue to rise:  

  The 2019 4-year cohort rate will be 95% 
  The 2017 and 2018 6-year cohorts will be 94 and 95% respectively 
  The current 9th-, 10th- and 11th-grade classes will have 91% students with 10+ credits

human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
- The schedule is arranged so that once a month, teachers in each grade meet together to examine student writing 
and develop next steps for instruction in each content area.  

-In English Language Arts, general education and special education teachers meet three times a week to plan lessons 
for writing and meet once every six weeks to plan their units and major assessments in English, most of which include 
writing assignments.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
 

Finding a “good” school or the “right” school for our kids may be the hardest and the most stressful part of raising a 
child in the city. Unfortunately, this is easier for some families than others. It is no secret that the NYC school system, 
and we include public, private, charter, independent and parochial schools in this definition, is one of the most racially 
and economically segregated systems in our country. We also know from the the Supreme Court's May 17, 1954, 
unanimous decision and our own common sense that separate is “inherently unequal." When we started East Side 
over 2 decades ago, one of our major goals was to create a school that would provide an opportunity for Black and 
Latino families in economic need to have access to an education that was equal to what other students were getting 
in private schools or wealthier districts or suburbs. We were extremely proud of our success, but also learned along 
the way the importance and power of welcoming a more diverse population of students and making our school truly 
integrated and equal. We are proud today to be one of the few Title I schools with a commitment to serving a 
majority Latino and black population that also has middle class and white students literally lining up at the door to get 
in. 

However, having a diverse population comes with many responsibilities, two of which we would like to focus on this 
year. First, students, staff and families being able to celebrate, discuss, share and understand the diverse and unique 
cultures, histories and needs of our student body. Second, we need to continue to close the achievement gap. We are 
very proud of the fact that our black, Latino and economically disadvantaged students regularly outperform their 
peers at other schools. Yet, we are still concerned that an achievement gap/ “education debt” exists in our school 
between our black and Latino students and our white and Asian students. We must continue to address this.  

  

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019 we will have closed the "achievement gap" / "education debt" by making 5% acheivement gains in 
general standing and honors academic status for our African American and Latino students by the end of the year. We 
will make sure that every teacher has one goal that is around disrupting racism that is part of their teacher 
development portfolio.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In the School Survey 4 years ago teachers indicated getting a lot of support and participating in a variety of 
professional development activities we offered that promoted professional growth. However, the feedback teachers 
were receiving along with the participation in professional development activities that caused growth were 
disproportionate from staff member to staff member. As a result, we combined the professional development 
activities with the Advance/Danielson teacher "rating" system and our own best practices list in order to build a 
Teacher Development Portfolio.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
Improve instruction through full implementation of the Teacher Development Portfolio. The goal is for each teacher to 
complete an Effective or Highly Effective Teacher Development Portfolio and improved end of year portfolio rating by 
June 2019. An emphasis this year will be on ownership and choice of TDPs and strengthening self-observations and peer 
observations.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 
development, and/or systems and structures needed 
to impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

 

All teachers will be provided with a designated school leader as 
an evaluator and a coach or support person who will provide 
feedback and support around the teacher’s goals and needs. 
The level of intensity and regularity will depend on the need of 
the teacher. In addition to informal/formal observations, all 
teachers will complete a comprehensive Teacher Development 
Portfolio which includes the following practices that support 
teacher growth and development.  

  3-6 supervisor observations using Danielson and East 

Side 10 Rubric 

  UbDs completed and uploaded for all units  
  1 School visit made to other school  
  3 lesson self-observations* 
  Participation in monthly Literacy Team Meetings  
  4 Peer Observations* 
  4 times observed by peers* 
  2 sets of student surveys  
  2 semester self-evaluations (Instructional Practices that 

Support Efficacy)  

  2 reflections (end of first semester and end of year)  
  Roundtable feedback  
  Attendance in Friday PD sessions  
  Additional professional de50velopment  
  Extra participation in and contribution to the 

community  

 

 

By the end of October all teachers will have received an Initial 
Planning Conference where teachers will choose the format that 
they want to be evaluated by. Teachers will set goals and meet 
with their Coaches to review these goals. 3 to 6 mandated 
observations will take place for each teacher along with pre and 
post observations meetings, for those that have selected to do

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

We have listed two goals in this area. One was added and one was continued from last year: 

1.  As our school has grown over the years and become more and more ambitious and successful in many ways, 

we feel we have lost some of the "mom & pop" feel of the community and the school may feel too big at 
times. We want to make sure that we understand our roots, feeling and running as much like a small school as 
possible. We also want to make sure that we streamline our initiatives and and have more of a "less is more" 
approach.  

2.  As proud as we are of our academic achievement and positive Learning Environment Survey results, we are 

not satisfied with our compliance report, which has us below the city average in 21 of of 50 categories. 
Whereas, we maintain that our goal is always efficacy over compliance, there are way too many areas where 
we are not meeting our compliance requirements without any strong explanation as to why not. In some of 
these cases, we believe compliance will actually improve our efficacy and help us better serve students.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 

1.  We will look closely at our history and roots with an eye towards towards streamlining our school focus on "less 
is more" and move towards a more distributive form of school leadership and focus on the advisory system and 
Teacher Development Portfolio (see above). This will be measured through our own internal surveys as well as a 
jump in School Quality Guide scores in Effective School Leadership and Trust from the already high scores of 
4.20 and 4.31 respectively to 4.40 in both. 

2.  We will meet or exceed the District average of compliance in 90% of the categories at the end of next year.

development, and/or systems and structures needed to

Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

1. SMALL SCHOOL FEEL  

 

Revision to school governance structure: 

 

Whenever possible the staff members most affected by a 
decision and closest to that decision should be involved 1. 
making that decision. Therefore, many school decisions are 
made by grade teams, vertical teams, planning teams, etc. 
(sometimes in consultation with a school leader.). 

 

  The “Cabinet” is made up of people whose full-time job 

is a school leader and support person. This currently 
includes the principal, APs, and the director of 
community and family services. We would like to add 
one middle school and one high school teacher 
representative to this team. 

  Grade Team Leaders is made up of a grade team leader 

from each grade team (selected by grade teams and 
approved by the principal) and the cabinet. This 
leadership group meets once a month as a team, once a 
month as part of the SLT*, and as needed throughout 
the year. They consult on schoolwide initiatives, issues, 
and policies and have a strong voice in making decisions. 
They design and plan PD days and general PD. 

Instructional Leadership Team is made up of the principal, APs 
who support instruction, coaches and vertical team leaders. This 
leadership team meets once a month as a team and as needed 
throughout the year. They consult on schoolwide initiatives, 
issues, and policies around instruction, teacher development and 
teacher support. They have a strong voice in making decisions. 
They design and plan vertical meetings and instructional P.D.

*SLT meetings will be moved to after school to allow for GTLs 
and students to be present. All SLT meetings are open to anyone 
in the school community, but the official and voting members of 
the SLT will be the grade team leaders. 

1. SMALL SCHOOL FEEL (continued) 

 

We will be reading The Power of Their Ideas by Deborah Meier as 
a staff as a way to understand and reflect upon our roots. We 
will also be asking veterans teachers to share stories of the 
"early years" at East Side. 

1. SMALL SCHOOL FEEL (continued) 

 

Focus on staff meetings and PD will be to support three main 
"CEP Power Goals: 

 

Strengthening the advisory system (explained here) 
 
  Teacher Development Portfolios (explained above) 
  Disrupting Racism (explained above) 

We will continue to examine our current advisory system, 
support and curriculum, prioritizing PD time to reflect on and 
strengthen this work.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

On the School Quality Report for family ties we earned a 4.68, which was 1.15 above the borough average and 1.12 
above the city average. This was an improvement above our already extremely high numbers. We are very proud of 
these findings as well as so many of the many supports we have in place to welcome and support families. However, 
in the spirit we our Section 5B - Supportive Environment Goal, we want to make sure we are addressing any and all 
"gaps" existing due to race or class. Therefore, our goal is to make sure that all families have equal access to support 
and resources. This means engaging and training families in disrupting racism work; collecting and examining 
demographic quantitative and qualitative data from families, paying particular attention to families who may feel 
marginalized or unwelcome. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019 we will see less than a 5% difference in engagement and participation data between families who receive 
free lunch (A/1), reduced lunch (2) and regular fee lunch (3).

● The social studies 
curriculum across all

critical analysis of 
primary and secondary 
sources. All classes also 
place a heavy emphasis 
on analytical writing in 
an essay format, as well 
as debating and oral

tests and exams are 
designed to emphasize 
these skills. 

● The social studies 
vertical team has 
focused a lot of time on 
articulating curriculum, 
and updating portfolio 
requirements. We have 
developed a graduation 
portfolio requirement 
for students in grades 
9-12 based on a 
“matrix” of social 
studies skill sets and 
content themes. The 
portfolio includes work 
across all four years 
that is representative of 
the following skill sets: 
argument and analysis 
(of historical topics and 
sources); making 
connections; presenting 
and analyzing distinct 
points of view; research 
paper; and oral 
communication. The 
portfolio must also 
include pieces that 
explore each of the 
following content 
themes: Social and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

Cultural Diffusion; Use 
and Abuse of Power; 
Government Systems; 
Revolution and Social 
Change; and Identity, 
Membership, and 
Human Rights. Students 
must demonstrate their 
understanding of the 
connections between 
the content of a given 
piece of work and the 
broader theme, both in 
writing and orally. To 
maintain a higher 
standard of rigor, only 
assignments having 
received a grade of 80 
or higher may be 
included in the 
portfolio. Students 
present and orally 
defend their progress 
work toward meeting 
the portfolio 
requirements twice a 
year in a “roundtable” 
format; these defenses 
are evaluated by other 
East Side teachers and 
educators from the 
community. 

● Students receive 
extensive support in 
preparing and revising 
(if necessary) the 
assignments in the 
portfolio and their 
semi-annual portfolio 
defenses. If they do not 
receive a passing 
evaluation at a portfolio 
defense, they have the 
opportunity to present 
again or make up that 
portfolio requirement 
with a different 
assignment in a 
subsequent semester.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
We use the NYSITELL to inform us on students' early literacy skills as well as the Teachers College Reading & Writing leveling 
program.  The data for this school year shows that most students are past early literacy skills as our school is a 6-12gr. school, 
most students have had at least 5 years of formal education in their native country / language.  
  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

As stated above, we analyze our progress and areas in need of improvement when we asses our student data during our Data 
Days throughout the school year ( 5 or 6 P.D. sessions).  We assess our students using the fountas and pinnell reading levels 
tools to asses their reading levels and create an intervention plan in order to ensure reading growth.  We also use the Mc Graw 
Hill periodic assessments to check on growth in reading, comprehension, and writing.  Finally, along with other classroom 
assessments we evaluate the 4 parts of the NYSESLAT from  the previous year to the current year to assess and plan for the 
interventions, accommodations, modifications that each student needs and that the program needs as a whole in order to 
continue working towards proficiency.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
We are a 6-12th gr school.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The NYSESLAT has revealed to us this school year that our students that took the exam are mainly at the advanced level with 
one being in intermediate out of 5 students total.  We are confident that our individualized assessment and interventions will 
allow many of our students to attain proficiency in the coming year.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

East Side has a free standing self-contained ungraded, heterogeneous ESL program which offers all ELA and content 
area instruction in English through the use of specific instructional strategies. Students are supported with a 
curriculum meant to amplify voabulary, develop language, reinforce, supplement and complement what they are 
learing in their ELA and content area classes. The ESL teacher also pushes into and co-teaches in an ELA & Social 
Studies class, as well as pulls out students as necessary to address the needs of those who require more assistance 
and are in need of differentiated instruction and modifications. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

                              East Side implements its ESL program in accordance with the CR Part 154.  Students receive mandated 
instruction and are scheduled for ESL instruction based on their proficiency levels as determined by the NYSESLAT.  Beginning 
and intermediate ELL students receive 360 minutes of ESL instruction per week in the MS and in the HS Beginning ELLs receive 
540 minutes and Intermediate HS students receive 360 minutes. Advanced ELL students receive 180 minutes of ESL instruction 
per week and 180 minutes of ELA instruction per week as per Part 154 regulations. There are 2 state certified ESL teachers and 
1 content teacher with a bilingual extension. Students in the ESL program are taught in English. However, support is provided 
in the students’ native language by pairing students from the same language groups as much as possible. Furthermore, the ESL 
service provider is fluent in French and Spanish. In addition to the ESL program services that are mandated for students during 
the school day, Title III also provides English Language Learners with supplemental instruction in an after school program. The 
ESL teacher heads the program which services ELLs in grades 6-12. 
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
                The ESL provider collaborates with students’ content area instructors in order to provide the necessary support 
required by individual students in given subject areas. Input from content area teachers allows for the ESL provider to tailor 
instruction based on student needs. Instruction is not only differentiated according to NYSESLAT scores but also by students’ 
individual needs as measured by classroom assessments given by the ESL provider and content area classroom teachers on a 
regular basis. To enable students access to content area materials which is above their proficiency level, the ESL teacher co-
plans with content teachers and modifies the texts the content area teacher will use in order to facilitate comprehension in 
the subject area. The ESL teacher also designs graphic organizers, provides students with glossaries, and uses visuals of 
concepts discussed in content areas to enhance meaning in the subject matter for students.  
        Instruction is also delivered through scaffolding lessons comprised of cooperative learning strategies, think-pair share, 
questioning, making predictions and inferences, listening, read a-loud, brainstorming, and a variety of other strategies to make 
content area input comprehensible and to promote and develop language development simultaneously.  A variety of 
instructional materials, based on student’s proficiency is also used to support our students in the different content areas. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

                The ESL teacher alongside a staff member that speaks and reads in the students' native language or DOE translator, 
administer a Native Language reading and writing exam.  Such data is used to shape the instructional support required for the 
student. Further staff development is needed in supporting staff on how to assess and use native language data to inform 
instruction.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a) SIFE students are provided with additional instructional support designed to meet their specific needs. We address our SIFE 
students’ needs with a four pronged approach. While catering to their academic needs we also accommodate and provide for 
their affective and motivational needs, functional and survival needs and finally their personal needs. 
  
b) Newcomers at East Side are serviced based on their results on the NYSITELL and if they've taken the NYSESLAT. They receive 
the mandated minutes as per CR Part 154.  As much as possible, in order to facilitate their transition, they are provided with 
individual and small group instruction. Additional support is also provided for them by placing them in groups with students 
who share the same native language, as well as providing home language bilingual dictionaries.  For these ELLs vocabulary 
development is key and will be taught explicitly and reinforced through word walls and vocabulary graphic organizers and a 
series of vocabulary building exercises.  Grammar will also be taught in context. 
  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

Teachers also rely on the zone of proximal development and newcomers are grouped alongside native English speakers, or 
higher proficiency ELLs, which not only promotes second language acquisition and the acquisition of BICS, but aids in students 
being able to perform the task at hand through cooperative learning, and thus the development of CALP. Through ZPD, 
learners are also able to acquire the behaviors associated with the next level.  
  
As they move forward and assimilate into the school culture they are expected to perform the same skills as native speaking 
peers, but will have modified and language appropriate texts suited to their proficiency levels. This directly aids in preparation 
for the ELA, as the student is learning and becoming proficient at skills tested despite the language barrier. Students receive 
supplemental instruction before and after school to prepare for the test. And finally ESL provider uses ELA tasks and skills to 
guide curriculum planning and classroom instruction. 
   
c) Our ESL program for this group of ELLs at East Side focuses on developing a curriculum in alignment with the Common Core 
ESL and ELA standards. This curriculum is delivered through a wide range of ESL methodologies and focuses on academic rigor. 
Teachers at this stage use realia and continue to scaffold instruction. The focus is on developing students’ CALP as well as their 
ability to perform rigorous tasks, which call for more detailed and abstract thinking.  
  
d) For our Long-Term ELLs, in addition to receiving the mandated ESL services, our focus is on designing literacy programs, 
which target the needs of these students. We provide a curriculum, which provides daily experience with authentic and real 
world texts to enhance fluency. We use graphic organizers to mirror the text, while teaching and practicing strategies good 
readers use and teaching writing skills. We make vocabulary a routine instruction. Our plan for Long-Term ELLs aims at 
providing and ameliorating their reading and writing skills which are usually found to be lacking and keeps them from testing 
out. 
  
e) We will continue to suppport our former ELLs for up to 2 years by providing them with breakast study support for 40min 2-5 
days a week.  We will provide HW Help / skills support 2-4 days 1 hour each day after school.  Extended time will be provided 
for former ELLs for testing.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ELLs with special needs are provided the required services, however their IEPs are taken into consideration and instruction is 
differentiated to suit. The ESL provider works very closely with Special Ed. teachers in order to ensure all of the student’s needs 
are being met. Together, they try to streamline all instructional efforts in order to achieve higher performance goals and 
acquisition of the language.  We also supplement their learning through the use of reading programs such as Wilson, Rewards, 
and websites such as Brain POP and Flocabulary, visuals, reciprocal teaching, peer tutoring, modeling, and sentence starters. 
We also use word sorts such as "Words Their Way", employ sophisticated synonyms and shades of meaning to expand their 
vocabulary and aid in language development while enabling them to learn content vocabulary. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our students are evaluated on a case by case basis. We assess their strengths and weaknesses in each subject area. For 
students who are proficient or thriving in a particular subject area, they are mainstreamed with GenEd students, while still 
maintaining push-in support in the classroom.  At our weekly " kidtalk" grade wide meetings, Friday P.D. and staff meetings, 
and finally, at our 5 times a year Data Days we observe the progress of each student and adjust their schedule and support 
services in order to allow for the student to be serviced in the most restrictive setting while still getting the instructional 
support needed for further growth.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
At East Side, we have a variety of targeted intervention programs for ELLs in the ELA content area.  All instruction is provided in 
English while still maintaining support in native language skills.  The ESL program supports the highly differentiated ELA 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

program used by all students at East Side Community High School.  The ELA program, which follows the Teachers' College 
model, focuses upon improving students' reading and writing skills.  Students are taught at their skill level and supported to 
reach higher language acquisition levels by reading independent reading books at their true grade and fluency level.  Through 
ELL technology stations audio books are also used to bridge the gap so that sutdents can mangae grade level books 
independently. Students are also aided to pick “the right book” for their proficiency level.  Students who are at the beginner 
stage , who are reading below a P level, and need to focus on reading skills are instructed through the Wilson Reading 
Program.  Direct instruction and guided reading models are used as part of our instruction practices.   In order to address 
multiple components of literacy the Read 180 program has proved to be highly successful.  
  
In writing instruction we focus on ensuring that ELLs are learning how to write in order to effectively communicate.  Students 
are instructed on how to generate language in order to express their ideas with assistance from the above stated programs 
alongside many QTEL strategies.  A large focus is also placed on instructing students on how to acquire and enhance academic 
writing skills in our upcoming ELL Technology stations.  We focus on the writing process and teaching students the various 
steps of prewriting, drafiting, revising,  poofreading and publishing.  We model these skills for students so as to make these 
steps more approachable as well as accessible and to solidy the process within the students’ minds. With our 
advanced  students we focus on essay writing and interpreting quotes in preparation for the English Regents.  We also work on 
purpose for which they are are writing different genres, the content, the organization as well as trageting specific grammatical 
structures which are poblematic and amplifying their vocabulary. 
  
Additional support in other areas of instruction are offered in Math, Social Studies, and Science.  A variety of texts are used to 
support the development of language: examples of high quality texts that will help to increase English language acquistion 
skills are as follows: Walker High (series) by Perfect Learning; Claudia Christina Cortez (series) from Stone Arch; Foundations for 
Algebra, Year One, Volume 1 by 
Kysh, Sallee, Hoey,  Understanding Fractions, Decimals, and Percents (Connected Mathematics 2) by Lappan, Fey, Fitzgerald, 
Friel, Phillips; The Max Axiom (Science series); and the Graphic Citizen (series on U.S. government).  
  
Students at ESCHS are part of a model that strives for inclusion.  Teachers have been trained in Urban Schools Attuned 
methodology and approach.  Teachers work to support students in identifying strengths and weaknesses; and to develop self-
advocacy skills.  The school has two ful time certified ESL teachers who teach and support ELL skills and classes to identified 
students in different forms:  One teacher is involved in the direct instruction.  The other ESL teacher acts as a librarian and 
provides further consultation, books, and related materials to support core subject teachers of ELL students.  This teacher also 
provides levels of direct instruction of certain students--based on the level of need and time. Our Literacy Coach works 
alongside teachers 6-12th grade on literacy instruction as well as acquiring materials and P.D. for all teachers of ELA who work 
with ELL students 
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We will continue to improve our instruction on close reading and writing using CCLS as a guide, alongside language 
development support strategies across all content areas through our monthly Literacy Team meetings.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

No programs will be discontinued this school year. 
  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
During the school day students are scheduled for a Studio class.  The Studio class meets 4 - 5 times a week (depending on the 
grade).  Studio classes include: graphic arts, visual arts, theater, dance, skateboarding, foreign language, computer coding, 
yoga, guitar, and chess.  Students are also mandated to take Physical Education throughout the school year: yoga, soccer, 
volleyball, general PE fitness classes.   
  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

Through the Beacon /Unviersity Settlement after school program, all students are immersed in a variety of extracurricular 
activities (visual and graphic arts, music, dance, sports, tutoring, games, academic support, etc.)  The majority of our ELL 
students take part in these activities as we've encouraged them to attend in order to practice their English conversation skills 
and to adapt even faster to the community.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The texts and technology programs stated above in questions number 9 &11, make up the majority of our instructional 
materials along with the use of Rosetta Stone in order to also immerse students in every day English terms and 
vocabulary.   Our instructional materials change along with the needs of our students so we are in constant assessment of the 
students' needs as well as of our teaching tools and materials. 
  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

 Native Language support is provided through direct instruction,  Achieve 3000, Wilson Reading Program, Rewards Reading 
progaram. It is also provided through the use of bilingual dictionnaires, native  language dictionnaries, as well as the ESL 
teacher, paraprofessionals, and through pairing students who speak the same native language. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Required services, support, and resources do correspond to all ELLs regardless of age and grade.  We look closely at each 
students' individual needs, levels and work produced. Through this we are able to determine which resources best match our 
students’ levels. The ESL teacher modifies age and grade appopriate materials so that they are accessible to the student dispite 
their proficiency levels. Scaffolding is also provided as to enable the student to be able to access grade level materials. We 
work on grade level skills with modified texts, keeping in mind age-appriateness and interest at the same time. We do this 
while we still focus on English Regents prep for high school students and on State exam prep for middle school students. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
The texts and technology programs stated above in questions number 9 &11, make up the majority of our instructional 
materials along with the use of Rosetta Stone in order to also immerse students in every day English terms and 
vocabulary.   Our instructional materials change along with the needs of our students so we are in constant assessment of the 
students' needs as well as of our teaching tools and materials. 
  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
If students are accepted to the school by the end of June, students are invited to attend our Beacon Summer Intensive 
Enrichment program, where they take part in academic, social, and extra-curricular events.  This allows students to be 
integrated into the school culture before the school year starts.  We also have an intensive summer program during which 
students were able to work on their reading and writing skills. These activities not only allowed students to work on improving 
their skills over the summer, but to become familiar with the lens through which we teach, establishing a pattern which they 
would then be able to follow in the Fall.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Through the Rosetta Stone Program students are able to choose from over 25 foreign languages. We also offer Spanish as a 
High School elective course. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Teachers are trained to explore strategies that will accelerate development and academic language in English and acievement 
in content areas.  ELL training will take place for all teachers in order to increase the level and quality of differentiated 
instruction and further establish our mission as an inclusive school.  The goal is to help support our ELL population thorugh 
awareness and curriculum development.  This will be in conjunction with our ongoing work and discussion around best 
practices thorugh Urban Schools Attuned.  This PD will provide support the Title III instructional program.  Professional books 
made available for study groups include the following:  Classroom Instruction that Works with English Language Learners by 
Jane D. Hill and Kathleen M. Flynn (ASCD); Meeting the Needs of Second Language Learners: An Educator's Guide by Judith 
Lessow-Hurley (ASCD).  To improve knowledge and advocacy for ELL students, teacher study groups will be formed on 
site.  Our DOE serves as very informative and up to date PD for our provider and content area teachers.  PD provided by Maria 
Broughton and her team is also very infromative and helpful in terms of testing and complaince items in order to better serve 
our ELLs.  
  
 The professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school begins with an assessment of student data and their 
academic performance.  Once we analyze each students' areas in need of improvement we zoom into their content area 
perfomance as well as their NYSELAT scores in order to create a plan of action.  This plan of action is what guides our 
professional development for each semester.  
  
Teachers are trained in the various programs for instrucitonal support of ELLs.  Training is and will continue to be provided in 
QTEL strategies, Wilson, Rewards, Teachers College Readers & Writers Workshop,  Read 180, and Multi-Sensory Reading 
Instruction to name a few. 
  
Assistant Principals, counselors, and SpEd staff are also trained in the social-emotional implications for ELL students as well as 
resources, language needs /supports, identification process if need be, etc.

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section.

Since we are a 6-12th grade school the programs and interventions remain consistent throughout the ELL student's career at 
ESCHS, depending on the student's needs and level.  The ESL teacher remains the same from 6-12th grade and is therefore 
aware of the needs of each student.  Advisors from grade to grade communicate about the students academic and Social 
Emotional needs in order to ensure that there is consistency in the support provided to each student.   
  
 As part of our P.D. we analyze and break down the data of all of our students.  A full 2 hours a week of P.D. is provided for 
staff.  Literacy, student progress, passing rates, etc. are constantly discussed.  Ineviatbly our ELL students are studied closely 
during these Data Days, kid-talk meetings, and 6-12th grade vertical subject area meetings; in onrder to create plans of action 
to better integrate and teach the skills necessary for success.  The data gathered assists teachers in differentiating their 
instruction to better meet the needs of their ELL students and especially in informing the instruction of the ESL provider, who 
is to work closely with the core subject area teacher to set goals and continue to assess progress.

Parental Involvement 

 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
5 times a year our teachers meet with parents to discuss specific and overall progress of each student. We enusre that 
information is provided on the students' language development to the families. These are one one one meetings with parents 
and the student where progress and lack of progress areas are discussed and a student support plan for further growth and 
support is created and re-visited for each conference 5x a year.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Parents are highly involved in meetings regarding their child's academic progress as well as in the presentations / celebrations 
of their work.  Translation services are provided to parents via a staff member, community member, or a hired translator.  
  
After the initial parent orientation workshop that takes place for newly enrolled ESL students, we hold 3 main Parents of ELLs 
workshops:  "Understianding the NYS Math test and Supporting Your ELL Child at Home to Prepare for It"; "English Language 
Arts and Literacy and How to Support your ELL Child's Language Skills Development"; and " Summertime English Support for 
your ELL Child at Home -- How to Keep the Learning Going Over the Summer."  The purpose of these meetings is to provide 
strategies on how to support their childs' academic success.  Parents have the opportunity to voice their concerns regarding 
their childs' academic progress and language acquistion as well as learn how to better support their child.   
  
Parents are invited to attend a variety of events: 
* Fall, Winter, and Spring Parent Social events -- to invite parents into the community with the goal of building a bond with the 
Advisors and School Leaders. 
*Parent Expo -- variety of workshops offered to support and educate families 
*Family Nights -- parents are invited to visit classrooms, meet with teachers, become informed on the curriculum (including 
state standards and assessments) and expectations for each class, parents have the opportunity to voice their needs and

*Family Reading Conferences -- the Principal, Humanities / ELA teachers, and Literacy Coach meet with families to review the 
literacy program at the school, conference about their child's individual reading levels, goals, and plans of action to help the 
child improve in their literacy skills.  
*Parent Book Clubs -- The Principal sponsors parent book clubs in an effort to further expan our "community of readers" as 
parents are the primary role models for their children.  
*Family Overnight College Trip -- families are invited to sign-up and attend an overnight college trip to expose students and 
families to future opportunities available.  This is in conjunction with our College Bound Initiative program.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Mark Federman, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

We look up the ATS report UPPG that specifies students’ home language. Not only for our ESL students but also 
for students who may be fluent in English, but whose parents speak a language other than English.  

• For incoming students we pay special attention to the Home Language Interpretation Survey to assure that staff 
is notified of parents’ home language in order to ensure proper communication with families.  

• At the end of the prior school year we ensure that students are scheduled to have an Advisor that speaks the 
parent’s Native Language as much as possible in terms of staffing availability. This assures that all parents have a 
liaison that will communicate information to them on a regular basis. The parent is thus, also able to inquire about 
their child’s education in depth. In cases where there is no Advisor on the particular grade that speaks the 
parents’ Native Language, we provide the Advisor (and all staff members) with the DOE translation services. We

also provide the staff with names and contact info. of other staff members who are fluent in languages other than 
English.  

• Letters and calls (on the School Messenger) are sent home in students' home language.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

whose parent / 
guardian’s main 
language is Spanish, 33 
Chinese, 7 Bengali, 4 
Tibetan, 3 Japanese, 1 
Arabic, and 1 Fulani.  

   

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.

Month/Frequency of Meetings  

How does your school plan to provide 

interpretation service(s)?  

 

 

Starting the second week of school, in 
September, our school holds a family 
night (curriculum share and 
celebration). At this event parents 
meet all of their childs' teahcers and 
are also invited to a social event 
where staff and parents mingle over 
food and music. 5 other times a year 
parents meet with their childs' 
teachers to discuss progress and 
interventions needed. Parents of 
students with IEPs also attend yearly 
IEP meetings with the Specail 
Education teacher or the School 
Psychologist. Parents of students that 
are struggling with reading also meet 
with the Principal, Literacy Coach, 
and teachers for a Literacy workshop. 
Parents are also invited to attend 
seasonal / holiday celebrations, PTA 
meetings, SLT meetings, etc.  

   

 

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.

what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

As stated above, we will ensure timely translation by planning ahead and keeping a close eye on our school and DOE 
calendar to plan ahead in terms of notifications sent home.  

Through proper identification of native language spoken at home for each student, we will ensure that all written 
information is sent in the native language. We will also provide oral translation services through school personnel and 
through phone translation services.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?
