Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our school mantra is “At P.S. 55, We say what we think. We write what we say, and if we had the time we would read 
all day. Think, Say It, Write It and Read.” Our systems and routines for instruction all focus around the notion that 
students must be engaged to think, talk and write in order to gain understanding. We recognize this is all achieved 
through consistent growth.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

Instructional Focus 

As a community we will engage in rigorous projects based learning . Our units encourage students across all 
populations to synthesize information and develop critical thinking skills required to solve real world challenges.  

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
  Beginning of school year meet the teacher and supply drop off. P.S. 55 invites all families to come to school, 
meet, their child's teacher and drop off supplies prior to the start of school. This establishes clear organization 
to enable us to start school in a clear and organized fashion. Parents and Students know where to go and 
what to do prior to school starting. This alleviates much of the fear and concern for both students and families 

  The Academic Family calendar provides families with all of the important events needed to be prepared for 

for the entire school year 

  Monthly Mystery Readers in each class grades PK-5 provides families with an opportunity to connect with 

their child's class, teacher and the curriculum 

  The Terrapin Times Newsletters created by teachers on each grade provides a window into the curriculum for 

 

families to be abreast of the work being prepared by teachers and students 
Social Media is regularly shared promoting the occurrences within our school. We can be found at Ps 55 
Maure on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram 

  Parent Learning series-Are aptly timed to piggy back our PTA meetings which occur every third Thursday. We 
utilize these as OPEN HOUSE events to showcase our Magnet School, share best practices and activities that 
occur throughout the school, and highlight our student and staff accomplishments.  

  P.S. 55 uses the Parent Communication time on Tuesdays to engage families in academic support conferences 

for students who may be considered At-Risk. During these meetings we share parent support resources, 
intervention tools, student performance and grade level expectations for success in a student's current grade.  

  15 Minute scheduled Parent Teacher Conferences for Fall and Spring. P.S. 55 utilizes the parent 

communication time to provide professionally scheduled Parent Teacher Conferences. These conferences are 
scheduled during our beginning of the year curriculum overview and establishes clear routines for how we 
should speak about student progress 

  The Samuel Field Y after-school program provides a valuable service to our families. This program is year 

long. It provides after-school care for students in grades K-5 from 2:40-6:00 pm. The program is both 
recreational and Academic. There is also a summer camp component. All of this is free for approximately 120 
students.  

  Utilizing Research to Support Best Practices 
  Establishing clear protocols for Checks for Understanding and Check-Ins 
  Providing Rigorous Instruction through the presentation of challenging problems to solve and supporting 

students based on data  

  Utilizing standards based, national recognized tools to evaluate student performance (Fountas & Pinnell and 

Scantron Performance Series) 

  Establishing clear goals for all students based on student performance 
  Math Activities promote student thinking 
 

Social Studies and Science Integrated Literacy Units of Study support reading and writing in a wide variety of 
genres  

  Projects based (PBL) approach supports student research and writing to reach a variety of learning styles 
  We have a clearly defined grading policy that supports what we value as a school community 
  Assessment calendars identify and clarify expectations for assessment and data use to support learners 
  RTI is established for at-risk students to provide data based literacy instruction. Smarty Ants is used to support 

struggling readers in (K-1)RAZ kids (2-3) and Achieve 3000 is utlized to support students with issues in 
comprehension in grades (4-5). Challenging Texts that can be adjusted to support varying lexile levels are used 
to support these struggling students. Frequent Teacher feedback is also provided. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Over time we have grown a small population of students who are considered to be on the Autism Spectrum. These 
students struggle in social situations and each child in this category has very specific needs and triggers. We have 
integrated these students into the ICT and Self-Contained settings, and we support them by providing stronger 
models for social interactions and more opportunities to interact with students in a less restrictive environment.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

According to the Framework for Great Schools and our most recent Quality Review, 2017-18, The Maure Magnet 
School has made the most progress in the following categories: 

  3.4-Setting High Expectations for Learning-(Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environment, Collaborative 

Teachers, Effective School Leadership, Strong Family and Community Ties) 

o  School leaders consistently communicate high expectations to the staff around academic 

expectations in the form of color coded bulletins and walkthroughs, in alignment to the Danielson 
Framework for Teaching. School leaders partner with families to support high expectations for their 
children through workshops, newsletters, and conferences, which are connected to college and 
career readiness. Communication to teachers is aligned to the school’s instructional goals with 
intervisitations among teachers and training for the staff, to support mutual accountability for 
maintaining high expectations through professional training for teachers. Families use the supports 
provided to them to help their children achieve progress towards high expectations. 

  4.1-Teacher Support and Supervision(Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environment,Effective School 

Leadership) 

o  "School leaders support the development of all teachers with frequent cycles of classroom 

observations with a focus on the implementation of the “Quote of the Day” with effective feedback 
with next steps and an analysis of student work. Feedback aligned to the Danielson Framework for 
Teaching, provides teachers with actionable next steps." 

  1.1-Curriculum(Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environment, Collaborative Teachers, Effective School 

Leadership) 

o 

"An engaging curriculum, aligned to the Common Core Standards is accessible to all students. Most 
students are developing higher-order thinking skills through targeted questioning aligned to curricula 
units of study which is building coherence across grades and supports building college and career 
readiness." 

 

 

 

 

The Area of Focus according to the 2017-18 Quality Review was indicated as being 1.2 Develop teacher pedagogy 
from a coherent set of beliefs about how students learn best that is informed by the instructional shifts and 
Danielson Framework for Teaching, aligned to the curricula, engaging, and meets the needs of all learners so that all 
students produce meaningful work products. 

In order to address this concern, The Maure Magnet School, P.S. 55's main areas of focus are related to the success of 
our Projects Based Learning (PBL) initiative. These foci are directly connected to the absolutes/non-negotiables that

we deem necessary for the success of this program. The meaningful work products and content delivered will be 
supported through the following initiatives: 

  Driving Questions 
  Making Thinking Visible 
  Questioning and Discussion 
  Goal Setting 
  Presentations of information and or problem solving 

Driving Questions-Are the overarching questions that frame each unit of study. They must be: 

  Engaging for students 
  Open Ended 
  Aligned with learning Goals 

Our Driving questions are designed to ensure that students on lower grades (PK-1) are specifically designed to inform 
a particular audience 

Our Driving questions are designed to ensure that students in grades (2-5) are specifically designed to either inform or 
solve a particular problem. 

Making Thinking Visible-Is about the development of universal tools that are designed to allow students to show 
what they know and allow teachers to assess student understanding in order to support them. We will continue to 
use particular tools and proved updated tools across the school that all classrooms and pedagogues will utilize in 
order to help students to make their thinking Visible.  

  Mathematics 

o  The Math template provides students with a tool to select a strategy for problem solving and show 

o 

their understanding of how they use that strategy 
In all classrooms teachers share and show a variety of problem solving strategies that must be chosen 
to solve problem 

 

Literacy 

o 

In all classrooms teachers and student utilize R.A.C.E.(S.) graphic organizers to organize thinking in 
order to support them in prepararation for writing 

o  All classrooms have parking lots where students can question and wonder about the content being 

studied 

Questioning and Discussion- Continues to be an important component of daily instruction. We plan instruction to 
support student to student and teacher to student talk to dig deeper into the content and flesh out new ideas. 

Goal Setting-In every class we set goals for students by utilizing data from assessment tools, evaluating student data 
and sharing with students and families expectations for future performance to meeting grade level expectations. 
Teachers work with students on skills of need in order to help them to achieve their goals.  

Presentations and Problem Solving-Through the work in our Projects based learning units of study, teachers and 
students will work toward presenting the information learned through multiple modalities in order to showcase their 
understanding. These presentations will either provide context and content for a particular audience or work to 
address a problem when answering our driving questions.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
In the 2018-2019 school year we plan to conduct school reviews with administrators and the school Leadership team 
to address our school-wide foci and initiatives for the year. This initiative is intended to help narrow our lens for 
discussion and improvement and ensure that teachers, administrators, parents and students all understand the 
expectations, teaching practices and adjustments made to improve instruction and student learning.  

 

As the 2017-2108 school year concluded, we conducted a comprehensive review of our school’s education program. 
Information was gathered using current quantitative and qualitative data with respect to student progress. Our 
school’s strengths, accomplishments and challenges were identified after analyzing our Quality Review Report, 
Principal Performance Observation, Benchmark Assessments, English Language Arts and Math testing data and 
NYSITELL results. As a result of this analysis, a math focus was developed help strengthen all learners while placing 
special emphasis on our students with disabilities and English New Learners.  

Strengths  

The key data points below highlight some of the impact of our strength that was noted by reviewers or evidence in 
student achievement 

Quality Review Findings 2017-18 

The findings and ratings of the Quality review are as follows: 

● School leaders consistently communicate high expectations to staff about professionalism, instructional and 
communication and provide training resulting in a culture of mutual accountability for those expectations. QR 
statement QR ( 3.4)  

● In addition, school leaders and staff effectively communicate high expectations that support the successful 
partnering with families to further student progress toward college and career readiness. QR statement ( 3.4 )  

As result of these findings, teachers receive high quality, structure, on-going training and professional development 
and are held accountable for expectations. In addition, families have taken on an active role in the school community 
to create successful partnerships throughout the school. QR ( 1.4, 3.4) 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 

Our Needs 

Although our instructional priority for the 2017-2018 school year was to support Questioning and Discussion with 
use/application of academic language, our current performance data reveals that students with learning disabilities 
and English language learners have not fared well with solving multi-step problems and using and interpreting data to 
answer questions. 

Quality Review Report 2014-2015 

It was noted that there is a need for the school to provide consistent instructional supports for all students that 
include, strategic extensions that foster higher order thinking skills and implement lessons that provide students with 
multiple entry points and differentiation during daily instruction in addition to addressing the needs of English New 
Language Learners (ENL) and Students with Disabilities (SWD). QR (1.2, 2.2) 

Principals Practice Observation 2015-2016 

● Across classrooms curricula is aligned to the standards and instructional shifts, however across a variety of 
classrooms there was uneven critical thinking leading to inconsistent multiple entry points, scaffolds for SWD’s Ells 
and advances learners. QR (1.2) 

● The school uses common assessments to determine student progress however the results are inconsistently used to 
adjust curricula. QR (2.2) 

  The school needs to deepen the scaffolding of instruction so that all lessons engage students, reflect 

purposeful groupings and offer suitable challenge at their level, including effective questioning that elicits 
higher-order thinking and extends learning. QR (1.2, 2.2) 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, all students will utilize content specific vocabulary, mathematical models and the mathematical practices 
to solve multi-step word problems as evidenced by an overall gain of +300 point in Scantron Performance Series in 
Mathematics in grades 2-5.

As per the school’s Quality Review 2014-2105 “while teachers conference with students based on the use of these 
common assessment tools, including formal and informal tools, the school is in the process of creating a clear picture 
of student progress towards goals and supports to increase mastery for English language learners, Students with 
Disabilities and advanced students across classrooms.

Needs 

The school needs to create a clear picture for student progress towards goals and supports to increase mastery for 
English language learners, Students with Disabilities and advanced students across classrooms. QR (1.2, 2.2) 

Principals Practice Observation 2015-2016 

  Across classrooms curricula are aligned to the standards and instructional shifts, however across a variety of 

classrooms there was uneven critical thinking leading to inconsistent multiple entry points, scaffolds for 
SWDs, ELLs and advances learners. 

  The school uses common assessments to determine student progress however the results are inconsistently 

used to adjust curricula. 

  The school needs to deepen the scaffolding of instruction so that all lessons engage students, reflect 

purposeful groupings and offer suitable challenge at their level, including effective questioning that elicits 
higher-order thinking and extends learning.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
In order to enhance positive emotional responses and student academic achievement, 30% of our student body 
(15%male) (15%female) we will engage in a research based programs that will develop positive social skills and teach 
students how to regulate behaviors when in crisis. By June 2019, this will be evidenced by a 30% reduction in behavior 
based issues reported in OORS.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths 

According to the 2014-2015 Quality Review, “The majority of teachers are engaged in structured, inquiry-based 
professional collaborations that promote the achievement of the school goals. Teacher teams consistently analyze 
data and student work which typically result in improved teacher practice and progress towards school goals for 
groups of students.  

As a result, teams of teachers use established protocols to note trends and patterns in performance, which help them 
to revise and update unit and teaching plans and exchange ideas about promising practices which will help students 
make improvements. Teacher teams have noticed the improvement of students from September to December based 
on a compilation of data including conference notes, performance tasks, curriculum assessments, teacher created 
tasks, and pre and post tests in Literacy and Mathematics.” QR (4.2) 

Needs 

According to the 2014-2015 Quality Review, “ While teacher teams meet regularly to plan and revise units and while 
in the process of building and increasing teacher capacity, additional work needs to be more systematic in the analysis 
of these data sources for the mastery of goals for groups of students, including English language learners and Special 
Education students.” QR (4.2) 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of teachers will collaboratively engage in the planning, adjustment, evaluation and revision of PBL 
(Projects Based Learning) units of study. These multi-modality, multi-curricular units will support all students inclusive of 
SWD's and ENL's. The creation and delivery of these units will result in a 5% gain reflected in the ELA state assessments.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In the 2016-2017 school year we plan to conduct school reviews with administrators and the school Leadership team 
to address our school-wide foci and initiatives for the year. This initiative is intended to help narrow our lens for 
discussion and improvement and ensure that teachers, administrators, parents and students all understand the 
expectations, teaching practices and adjustments made to improve instruction and student learning.  

 

Strengths 

● According to the 2014-15 Quality Review, “The school in collaboration with input from parents create a year-long 
calendar of Parent Workshops in response to a parent survey, which include, but are not limited to the following 
workshops for Learning Leaders, Mathematics and Literacy Workshops, which are held on subsequent Saturdays 
during the Fall." 

● “Parent leaders are empowered to suggest, plan, organize and facilitate cultural events and activities, as well as 
facilitate the workshops based on their expertise and the needs of parents in the school community. Parents are 
familiarized and knowledgeable about the curriculum and academic expectations for their children, thereby 
strengthening the home school and connection.” QR (3.4) 

● “In addition, school leaders and staff effectively communicate high expectations that support the successful 
partnering with families to further student progress toward college and career readiness.” 

QR ( 1.1, 3.4 )  

Needs 

● As per the 2015-16 Learning Environment, it was communicated that not enough that parents were invited to 
school to view/observe everyday instruction (40%)  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, In order to support At-Risk students and their families, we will engage 75% of families with children who 
are At-Risk by supporting them in the recognition of learning gaps, providing tools, resources, extra-curricular activities 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

as well as checkpoints and parent learning events to ensure that all At-Risk students are provided with the necessary 
supports in order to close the achievement gap as evidenced by 5% reduction in students retained in grades K-2

Beginning of the school year, parents meet the teacher and drop 
off supplies . P.S. 55 invites all families to come to school to meet 
their child's teacher and drop off supplies prior to the start of 
school. This establishes clear organization to enable us to start 
school in a clear and organized fashion. Parents and Students 
know where to go and what to do prior to school starting. This 
alleviates much of the fear and concern for both students and 
families 

 

During our September and October PTA meetings, parents are 
provided with the following resources: 

 

The Academic Family calendar provides families with all of the 
important events needed to be prepared for for the entire school 
year 

 

Monthly Mystery Readers in each class grades PK-5 provides 
families with an opportunity to connect with their child's class, 
teacher and the curriculum

Parental and community involvement are always encouraged and welcomed. This is done with the support of the 
Parent Coordinator, Administration and teachers. Parent engagement involves the sharing of goals, curriculum and 
instructional methods/strategies. Home/school links with parents will allow parents of students to become more 
familiarized and comfortable with the curriculum and academic expectations for their children. This accomplished 
through the following: 

● Open houses 

● Blackboard Connect communication system 

● Multicultural Dinner: Evening November 

● Family Craft Night: May 2018 

● Book Fair: November & March 

 

The needs of the parents are also evaluated by the school Learning Environment Survey, ongoing conversations, PTA 
meetings, and Parent/Teacher conferences. Translation services are made available through Title I translation monies, 
when applicable.

The P.S. 55 MOSL Team met to discuss and made decisions in regards to the new Teacher Evaluation and 
Development System. Under the Education Law 3020.AC, we have been charged with making decisions in regards to 
the local measures of student learning for our school. The local measures of student learning will comprise 20% of the 
Teacher Evaluation and Development System.  

After careful review, we have decided to recommend to you that the default option is what would be an appropriate 
fit for our school. We have made this determination based on several different factors. The default option is an 
appropriate fit for our school because its guiding principles make sense for both our teachers and our students. First, 
the default option is feasible and can be implemented without burden. It allows us to use the systems that we already 
have in place. Some of those systems are CAFÉ, and VOICES. In addition, it is fair because it does not disadvantage our 
educators based on the population that we serve. It also allows for a shared responsibility on the part of all of the 
educators. The default option allows for a school wide approach where all of the teachers are working together 
towards a shared instructional focus. This option also allows for transparency and everyone in grades K-5 is held 
accountable to obtain and implement the common core. 

Furthermore, this model does not introduce new work to our school. We considered the fact that our school would 
continue the use of and Go Math. We will also be rooting targeted feedback to teachers within Danielson’s 
Framework. This model compares student performance to other similar student’s performance across the district to 
calculate growth and gives teachers credit for exceeding predicted growth. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 55Q , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the 
Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

P.S. 55Q will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. The 
Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
After reviewing the Progress Report, Learning Environment Survey, Standardized Test Data and 
NYSESLAT results, it was determined that our ENL population performed significantly lower in 
the area of Mathematics and Literacy due to the increasing demand for Literacy (i.e. complexity 
of text), problem solving and process writing in Mathematics. 
 
Students must be skilled in using at least the basic language of Mathematics where everyday 
words take on different meanings (i.e. table). Therefore, by linking the CCLS with instructional 
strategies(differentiated instruction, Workshop Model, inquiry and investigative problem 
solving) and coupled with a research based on second-language acquisition, we can better target 
the specific needs of our test-taking ENL population. 
 
A focal point of the Title III instruction is to provide language development through Imagine 
Learning software Before school (7:30- 8:15) and After school (3:00-4:20) Tuesday through 
Thursday involving students in Kg.-5 beginning Tuesday October 2nd. and ending on Tuesday 
June 3rd. for a total of 92 sessions. The early morning and after school programs will run 3 days 
a week, Tuesday through Thursday. The 2 certified ENL and 2 licensed common 
branch teachers, either morning or afternoon, will provide a team approach to ensure that 
Entering and Emerging levels ENLs are receiving support from all four. An ENL teacher will be 
providing strategies for language acquisition with a group (i.e. entering) while the content 
specialist, common branch teacher, will work with the other (i.e. emerging). Groups will switch 
on alternate sessions to ensure a well rounded learning experience. Instruction is geared around 
the following objectives: 
--Vocabulary development/fluency and comprehension. 
--Test sophistication skills/targeted support. 
--Literacy based activities in English with reinforcement prompts in their native tongue for 
language support. 
--Articulation exercises in English with native language support for encouragement and 
reinforcement. 
--Activity based lessons at the end of every section for positive reinforcement. 
--Content area and discussion. 
--Immersion in content through multimedia. 
 
The following instructional materials will be used to support instruction of students and were 
purchased with Title III funds 
--80 licenses for Imagine Learning software (CCLS aligned computer software designed to 
promote skill in grammar, phonics, vocabulary, syntax and reading comprehension for Entering 
and Emergent ENLs) 
 
The following personnel will be used to facilitate the program using Title III funds

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
--Per-session employment for four teachers  @ 60.65 for 92 session 3 days a week for 45min in 
the morning and 1.5 hrs in the afternoon  (per-session will be supplemented with magnets' 
monies ) 
 
The following materials were purchased to support this program not included in the Title III 
allocation 
--ENL strategies workbooks- NYSESLAT funds 
--My Talking Dictionary(interactive software designed to reinforce am ENL student's native 
language as well as second language(English)-Free 
--Graphic organizers-R.A.C.E.S. 
--PBL units of study 
--Safari Montage-TL funding 
 
Indicators of success: 
--Bi-weekly professional development for instructors to review student work, progress and to 
determine next teaching steps for the program and to disseminate tends to classroom teachers. 
Every 4-6 weeks Monday afternoons, as per UFT contract regarding professional development 
times. 
--Monitoring and recording of student achievement to set goals 
--students who participate in this program will demonstrate gains in scale scores and within 
performance levels on the ELA, Mathematics, and move from entering/emergent to 
transition/expanding in terms of the NYSESLAT assessment.

Professional development initiatives at P.S. 55 Magnet School are as follows: 
Common branch and special education teachers from grades Kg.-5 are included in these 
professional development session at this time because a large population of our ENL students are 
in the lower grades. 
These workshops are primarily focused on Literacy strategies for ENL students. It is expected 
that teachers utilize and implement these techniques within all content area work. The workshops 
are to familiarize teachers with the ENL mandates for both Literacy and Mathematics. Samples 
of these PD's are but not limited to: Text Structured Signal Questions and Nested academic 
Words, Instructional Scaffolds, Questioning, Problems and Solutions, Bridging Knowledge,

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
 After reviewing the Standardized Test Data, Computer Adaptative Assessments, Fountas and Pinnell and NYSESLAT results, it 
was determined that our ENL population in testing grades 3-5 continually perform better in the area of mathematics than in 
literacy. The benchmarks are derived from the researched based literacy and mathematics programs that are aligned to 
Fountas and Pinnell and the CCLS.  
  
The insight provided from these results are as follows: 1) We must provide common planning time for collaboration between 
classroom teachers and the ENL provider to identify specific linguistic and academic difficulties of individual students. 2) We 
must select themes for interdisciplinary units using the Balanced Literacy Workshop Model to increase differentiated 
instructional strategies and to increase accountable talk. Increasing accountable talk will build the confidence and support that 
ENLs need to feel comfortable to speak and participate in their everyday classroom environments. 3) Increase classroom 
libraries in native languages and  in multicultural books in order for the students to be exposed to all cultures and have a

diversified learning environment.  4) We should have a more concerted effort in adapting written materials into the 
appropriate language for parents and students.  5) We must increase the use of hands on instruction in math, science and 
technology. Reason being, that visuals enhance learning methodologies and ENLs will have a better recollection by using 
"hands on" teaching strategies. 6) We must increase parental involvement in their children's school work , as well as 
homework and extra help through workshops. Parents should be aware that regardless of their language deficiencies there are 
methods and strategies that can be used to become more involved with their child's education. 7) We must increase the 
writing instructional expectations for responses to literature and narrative writng in grades K-2 and for 
Opinion/Argument  writing in grades 3-5. By raising the bar and pushing the children to think at higher levels,  will only benefit 
the students by helping them to use language that will strengthen their writing pieces and also build on their current 
vocabulary. This will also help ENLs by allowing them to interchange words and create bigger and better sentence 
structures.  8) We must increase the use of portfolio assessments, rubrics and observations that are aligned with ENL 
standards, when deemed appropriate. 9) Finally, start looking more closely at student work to set clear expectations and 
performanced based outcomes.      
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 We are able to evaluate the success of our ENLs by using the NYSESLAT reports in order to see the progress the students have 
made from the prior year , we also are able to evaluate student progress throughout the year by teacher observations, 
through communication, unit test, Computer Adaptative Assessments, Benchmarking and looking student work.     
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
 Using NYSESLAT reports such as the modality reports, teacher observations and student work we are able to gauge and target 
specific areas of need in order for RTI personel to be able to focus on those concentrated areas of need. Students are generally 
serviced for 30min a day 2-3 times a week.     
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Even though there are no trackable patterns based on the NYSITELL , the information does show that a majority of the ENLs 
come from lower grades as opposed to the upper grades. By using the NYSESLAT Modality Reports we are able to utilize this 
data to see what area(s) that the ENLs are struggling and stagnant in and therefore we are able to build upon and teach  into 
to help continue  the growth in proficiency levels of all our ENLs.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

 

regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The program model used to deliver content area instruction to ENL at PS 55 is the Free Standing model.  If and when 
requested, 
 (based upon student enrollment) the dual language model is made available. Delivery of instruction in the push in 
model is 
 primarily in English. ReadyGen and Go Math are the primary source of curriculum used at PS 55.  Each has tools and 
components 
 that provide strategies for success of ENL students.  The ESL teacher and the classroom teacher use the parallel 
teaching method for 
 whole class and small group instruction. The parallel teaching method provides better targeted introduction for 
individual students 
 as teachers are able to plan for multiple entry points, which allows for successful access to complex texts.  Methods 
and strategies  
include: 
  
-Teaching through informational text 
-Scaffolding for difficulties presented by informational text 
-Close Reading: Giving students less text to read in order to allow students to re-read text for accuracy and 
comprehension 
-Looking for nuances within the text 
-Facilitating evidence based discussion 
-Encouraging students to recognize word relationships (comprehension of tense, word meanings, syntax) 
  
During instruction the ENL teacher offers picture support, translation (when applicable), delivers and reinforces the 
aforementioned 
 methods to ensure fluid language acquisition.

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
                 The program model used to deliver content area instruction to ENL at PS 55 is the Free Standing model.  If and when

aforementioned methods to ensure fluid language acquisition.    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

                The majority of P.S. 55 ENL students are in between the ages of 5 and 7.  Whereas many speak their native language 
very few can read or write it.  For students in the upper grades, translated versions of standardized testing are acquired when 
applicable.     
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Teachers alongside with the ESL teacher provide differentiated instruction as needed, small group instruction, use of various 
 scaffolds. Students always receive extra support from the ESL teacher even after students test proficient they are aware that 
they 
 can always come for extra help and support from the ESL  teacher.  
A.  SIFE: 
Assess students’ prior knowledge in content areas.  Based upon the data, teachers scaffold content area lessons and provide 
extra support such as pictures, tables, charts, and graphs.  Additionally, teacher’s frontload content area vocabulary and use 
supplementary materials that are available for the content area subject matter. 
  
B.  New ELL’s (Less than three years) 
Ell’s receive differentiated instruction, extra supports, visuals, RTI, small group instruction, translation when needed, and 
scaffolds during lessons.  ESL and classroom teacher plan strategically using the NYSESLAT test to encourage students to be 
vocal in the classroom setting. 
C. ELL’s (four-six years) 
Teachers use the NYSESLAT data to target modalities that ELL’s are weakest in or showing a lack of growth in and focus on 
various strategies domain to each modality, to help the ELL’s in the content areas.   This promotes students’ abilities and skills 
so they are eventually successful at testing proficient and/or showing progression throughout the year. 
  
D. Long Term ELL’s (6+ years) 
  
(THE MAJORITY OF THESE STUDENTS ARE SWD’s AND TEST WELL IN ALL MODALITIES EXCEPT FOR WRITING WHICH IS THE 
CAUSE OF THESE STUDENTS FAILING TO TEST PROFICIENT) 
Usually SWD’s work with the teacher using graphic organizers, various scaffolds, and as specific areas of need are targeted.   
  
E.  Former ELL’s (1 and 2 years after testing proficient) 
  
Students receive continued support from the ESL teacher, who works alongside the classroom teacher, in areas of weakness to 
 strengthen their skills.  ELL’s are firmly trained in the use of graphic organizers, and teacher’s frontload vocabulary, as well as 
 break down complex text.  ADDITIONALLY FORMER ELL’S continue to receive testing accommodations.

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
The instructional strategies used by teachers are as follows: Picture support, Imagine Learing program, Tiered vocabulary, 
small 
 group instruction and graphic organizers to name a few. Also note that content area studies are embedded in everyday units 
of 
 study as well   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
 The school supports ELL-SWD in achieving their IEP goals through the following:  
*Scheduled block of time for Voyager or Achieve 3000 (researched based program).  
*Scheduled push in by service providers in order to provide targeted small group instruction.  
*Cooperative planning time 
*Benchmark review of progress based on scantron, running records and classwork 
*The use of tiered systemic vocabulary  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Targeted before-school instruction will begin with the students in grades 1-5. These students will be indentified and participate 
in a before school instructional program. These students are identified based on their assessment data (standardized  scores, 
classroom observations, teacher estimate, running records etc…). Certain benchmarks are listed for students based on 
NYSESLAT, CAA (Computer Adaptive Assessments), and student work in ENL. Students may also be offered the morning 
program, AIS and SETSS. Students will participate in a small instructional group four times a week for approximately 30 
minutes each day. The program will run from November through June and the frequency will be 4 times/week @ 30 minutes a 
day Monday through Thursday supported by the ENL  and a common branches teacher. 
  
Indicators of Success: 
--    Creation of small (no more than 15 students) instructional groups based on student performance data 
--     Targeted focused instruction (utilizing a formalized program and supplementary materials) informed by student data in 
ELA and Math 
--     Monthly professional development for instructor to review student work, progress and to determine next teaching steps 
--     Monitoring and recording of student achievement to set goals 
--     Students who participate in this program will evidence gains in scale scores and within performance levels on the ELA, 
Math, and NYSESLAT assessments.  
  
Targeted after school instruction will consist of boys and girls in testing grades 3-5 who are in the lowest third. These students 
will receive small group instruction with additional support in ELA and Math. Key strategies and problem solving skills are 
addressed. Students who participate in this small group instruction will meet 2 times a week for 2 hours at a time. Addressing 
specific areas of need will provide our students with the necessary problem solving, comprehension and higher level thinking 
skills needed to accel on the NYS assessments. Alignment of instructional resources with school-wide goals to increase student 
performance on the ELA assessment will be on going and supported  by the Instructional Team (Administration/NSS Early 
Childhood Coordinator), and classroom teachers. 
  
Students who need transitional support will continue to receive services until they become proficient on the NYSESLAT. The 
needs of these students are derived from the NYSESLAT modality reports such as; RNMR, RLAT and RMSR, where targeted 
need areas can be pointed out and then addressed. Specific areas where students are lagging in will focused on in order to 
move the ELL's to proficient status on the NYSESLAT.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

  We have considered the following programs and changes: 
*Tiered classes for ESL students 
* Tiered vocabulary and idomatic phrases program 
*Push-in model with increased frequency 
*Use of Imagine Learning and MYON program 
  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

ENLs will only discontinue services if they test out of the spring NYSESLAT and test proficient in all areas. All ENLs are afforded 
equal access to all school programs whether general education or special education. These students participate in all subject 
areas such as; math, ELA, cultural studies, reading center, science, art, gym, etc… Technology is also provided to ENLs through 
the use of Imagine Learning software and during open access time in the computer lab. The Imagine Learning program is used 
during the morning program, and by certain classroom teachers.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Native language support is only provided in spanish only and it is used for beginner and struggling ELL's as added support while 
learning content area academia. All services correspond to ENLs ages and grade levels by the use of the NYSESLAT and state 
curriculum. We currently do not offer language elective to ELLs.  Additional independent reading resources (leveled by genre, 
and content based) have been purchased for classroom libraries to support students as they become fluent readers. Additional 
teaching resources (mentor texts and read alouds texts) have been purchased to support each of the units of study in Reading 
and Writing workshop.    
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The following instructional materials are used to support instruction for ENL students: 
-Graphic Organizers 
-Imagine Learning (CCLS aligned computer software designed to promote skills in grammar, phonics, vocabulary, and syntax for 
beginner and intermediate ENLs) 
-Wordly Wise (workbook, with webpage extensions, designed to reinforce lessons in vocabulary and grammar) 
-Voyager: “Ticket to Read” (computer software used to develop fluency accuracy and deeper comprehension) 
-Go Math (CCLS aligned) 
-My Talking Dictionary (interactive software designed to reinforce an ENL students’ native language as well as second language 
[English].     
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

 Translation services are provided when necessary.  Additionally, students are supported by being paired with a peer who 
speaks a common language.  The ENL teacher provides ENLs with interactive bilingual dictionaries, and instructs on the use of a 
Thesaurus.  Teachers also provide bilingual flashcards with picture support.       
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

 Based upon the curriculum, age appropriate resources are distributed to teachers to ensure that each of our ENL students 
increase their proficiency levels and abilities in every area of the four modalities.     
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
The following instructional materials are used to support instruction for ENL students: 
-Graphic Organizers 
-Imagine Learning (CCLS aligned computer software designed to promote skills in grammar, phonics, vocabulary, and syntax for 
beginner and intermediate ENLs) 
-Wordly Wise (workbook, with webpage extensions, designed to reinforce lessons in vocabulary and grammar) 
-Voyager: “Ticket to Read” (computer software used to develop fluency accuracy and deeper comprehension)

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
 P.S. 55 conducts various parent orientations, workshops, and our annual Multi-Cultural dinner.  Additionally the ENL teacher 
conducts a morning program which operates Monday-Thursday from 7:45 to 8:15 am, from November to June.  This program 
gives extra support to beginners ENLs who are new to the school, as well as provides a platform by which former ENLs remain 
connected.  We now need to consider activities for our newly enrolled ENLs more so for our incoming kindergarden (ie: 
Turning 5 cases)    
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

N/A    
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Professional Development initiatives have already been implemented at PS55. All common branch and special eduction 
teachers are included during these professional development workshops. These workshops are primarily for Literacy strategies 
for LEP students and for teachers to be able to utilize and implement these techniques with all content area work. The 
workshops are to familiarize teachers with the ENL mandates for Literacy and Mathematics. Samples of these PD's are but not 
limited too: Text Structured Signal Questions and Nested Academic Words, Instructional Scaffolds, Questions, Problems and 
Solutions, Bridging Knowledge, Academic Language and etc.. Under Title III,  language acquisition techniques and strategies will 
be supported and stressed through the following: 
  
--     Time provided for collaboration between classroom teachers and ESL teachers 
--      Instruction on use/incorporation of Technology for ENL students 
--      Adapting written materials into appropriate language for students and parents 
--      If budget allows, outside consultation and/or in-service consultation will be provided 
--      Language Acquisition Development workshops provided by QBSF 
  
We have begun to examine the individual needs of students by looking at teacher's assessment data, IEP's , classroom 
observations, and running records to determine special needs students in this subgroup who would benefit from 
mainstreamed ELA instruction.  
  
Indicators of Success: 
--     Creation of a mainstreaming committee consisting of related service providers, administrators, and classroom teachers 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70 

 

 

who will assess each child considered for mainstreaming and support that student's transition to a general education 
environment and maintain data on the student's progress and achievement.  
--     An increase of peer discussions between the general education and the special education teachers regarding curriculum, 
individual student progress and instructional approaches.  
--    Professional development opportunities for all classroom teachers to provide them with instruction in using data gathered. 
All teachers are proficient at collecting data, but some need to understand how to look at the data they have gathered in order 
to form flexible groups in which they utilize a variety of instructional strategies and differentiate student learning processes.  
--    Alter scheduling to include additional common preparation periods by grade, to ensure that classroom teachers 
understand and facilitate various teaching strategies and best practices.  
--    Increase use of alternate strategies to ensure embedded professional development (Lunch and Learn sessions, study 
groups, inquiry groups etc…). 
  
When:  All school year                       Frequency: Daily                   Supported by: Classroom Teachers and Instructional Cabinet 
  
Indicators of Success:  
--      More effective use of common planning time 
--      An increase in the percentage of special needs students whose programs are altered to move them into a less restrictive 
environment (mainstreaming), in which their academic needs are more efficiently met  
--     More standardized, cohesive methods and/or systems of data collection that is evident across all grades 
--     Teacher proficiency increase in data analysis 
--     Increased use of small group instruction in ELA (shared and guided reading), flexible and strategic groups 
--     Increased item analysis of interim assessments and teacher planning to address findings of specific data analysis 
--     Data derived from Imagine Learning data base 
--      Increase in student achievement across all levels as students receive instruction as a result of looking at student work   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
As ELLs transition from one school year to the other they will receive support by the guidance counselor who will discuss 
concerns, issues and reach out to the new school in order to make the transition as easy and as comfortable as possible for ELL 
students and parents. ELL training for all staff is conducted throughout the course of the year through faculty conferences, 
professional development in the beginning of the year and carried on during monthly scheduled P.D.s as well ( ie: Scaffolding 
Close Reading of Complex Texts, Gradients in Complexity of Informational Texts , Reading for Purpose and Meaning, Core 
Instructional Focus and etc…). Records are maintained through the use of sign in logs and agendas.       
As per UFT contract, all pedagogues receive PD during the 150 minutes allocated on Mondays and Tuesdays.  All PD activities 
are 
 logged with next steps.     
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
  
--    Utilizing Parent Coordinator to survey parent needs regarding understanding the curriculum and instructional approach 
--    Creating a year long calendar of Parent Workshops in response to Parent Survey 
--    Emphasizing the importance of utilizing technology to support student targeted practice at home (Interim Assessments, 
etc…)

--    The role of the class parent will be to assist in coordination of class activites, share information with parents and encourage 
participation in parent workshops.  
--    Requiring that classroom teachers include a celebration as the final phase of each unit of study. This will increase parents 
understanding of the expectations of Writing Worshop curriculum and ways they can support their children at home.  
  
The needs of the parents are also evaluated by school  Learning Environment Survey, ongoing conversations , PTA meetings, 
and Parent/Teacher conferences. Translation services are made available through Title I translation monies when 
applicable.      

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Improvement in sharing the goals of curriculum, instructional methods/strategies, home/school links with parents will allow 
parents of ELL students to beome more familiarized and comfortable with the curriculum and academic expectations for their 
children. Activites that take place to invlove parents are Cultural Awareness day, Mutlicultural Dinner, Family Craft Night and 
workshops geared towards helping their child get ready for the state exams. Parents are also utilized throughout the year on 
our lower grades. We alos have GED and ESL classes that take place in the building throughout the week.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Ralph K Honore, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

P.S. 55 is a Title 1 school located in District 28 in the Richmond Hill section of Queens. Our school is made up of 
approximately 509 children from Pre-K to Grade 5. P.S. 55 currently serves an ENL population of approximately 68 
students in grade K-5. PS 55 has a Free Standing English as a Second Language program that emphasizes English 
language acquisition through the areas of listening, speaking, reading and writing. 

The home languages of the majority of these students are Punjabi and Spanish. We have had a small influx of 
various languages such as Urdu, Hindi, French Creole, Arabic and Bengali. Our students are identified through the 
use of HLIS, NYSITELL and NYSESLAT. They are serviced according to the guidelines established by CR Part 154. 
Identification of students new to the program is conducted as follows: All new admits are processed through the 
pupil accounting secretary and the assistance of a licensed pedagogue (ENL teacher). The licensed pedagogue 
conducts an informal interview by asking questions such as: previous schooling, new to the NYC public school 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75 

 

system, if the family speaks another language, etc… If they are new to the DOE, they are required to fill out a 
Parent Survey. A computer generated memo is also printed out and cross referenced with the new admit slips 
printed out by ATS to make sure that newly admitted students who are eligible to take the NYSITELL are tested 
within the 10 day period. The ENL teacher then administers the NYSITELL and if spanish speaking students score 
below cutscores on the NYSITELL they are administered the Spanish NYSITELL. Once the scores are determined 
from the NYSITELL, the ENL teacher contacts the parent to invite them to Parent Orientation in which they discuss 
appropriate placement and alternative programs and their implications. Finally, any ENL students who have not 
made adequate yearly progress determined by the NYSESLAT and ATS reports such as: RNMR, RLAT, and RMSR 
are discussed during our monthly PPT meeting in consultation with the ENL teacher to determine whether it is a 
language problem or a processing issue.  

A parent's preferred language for communication is determined primarily by the Home Language Survey and 
confirmed after an initial informal interview with the ENL teacher. This information is used to determine the 
language by which the Parent Orientation will be presented in. It is during this initial meeting with parents that 
the level of translation support needed is determined. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

We also utilize the DOE's over-the-phone service if we cannot accommodate a particular language or the DOE vendor, 
"The Big World." 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Parental and community involvement are always encouraged and welcomed. This is done with the support of the 
Parent Coordinator, Administration, ENL teacher and teachers throughout the school. Improvement in sharing the 
goals of curriculum, instructional methods/strategies, home/school links with parents will allow parents of ENL 
students to become more familiarized and comfortable with the curriculum and academic expectations for their 
children. Activities that take place to involve parents are Cultural Awareness day, Multicultural Dinner, Family Craft 
Night and workshops geared towards helping their child get ready for the state exams. Parents are also utilized 
throughout the year on our lower grades. 

-- Utilizing Parent Coordinator to survey parent needs regarding understanding the curriculum and instructional 
approach  

-- Creating a year long calendar of Parent Workshops in response to Parent Survey 

-- Emphasizing the importance of utilizing technology to support student targeted practice at home (Imagine Learning, 
Learning A-Z, Smarty Ants and Achieve3000) 

-- The role of the class parent will be to assist in coordination of class activities, share information with parents and 
encourage participation in parent workshops 

-- Requiring that classroom teachers include a celebration as the final phase of each unit of study. This will increase 
parents understanding of the expectations of Writing Workshop curriculum and ways they can support their children 
at home.  

-- The English New Learner Parent Engagement program provides parents with information on topics they have 
inquired about. For example, special education services, immigration policies , library cards, parental rights in school, 
etc.

The needs of the parents are also evaluated by school Learning Environment Survey, ongoing conversations, PTA 
meetings, and Parent/Teacher conferences. Translation services are made available through Title I translation monies 
when applicable.  

The additional mechanisms used to gather feedback from parents are as follows: Parent surveys; Teacher 
communication (email); PTA meetings; Parent Coordinator contact; and the Learning Environment Survey;.
