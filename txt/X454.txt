Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

At the Science and Technology Academy,  strong and dedicated leadership, a nurturing and personalized school 
environment, respect among members of the learning community, and a clear mission and vision this road lead to 
students meeting the highest academic expectations and standards, making smooth transitions to selective high 
schools and competing successfully for admission to top public and private colleges. Our school culture is 
characterized by a shared vision for academic excellence and the healthy personal growth of all students; grounded in 
the strong belief that all students can and will succeed in their endeavors.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

At the Science and Technology Academy, our school community clearly articulates and relates to the driving forces for 
our work, the mission and vision of the school and what the school values. This commonly held belief by the school 
community makes possible a strong instructional program. We invest in a community outreach programs; after school 
clubs, “Against All Odds” outreach, “Sports & Arts in Schools Foundation” and Pencil partnership that connect home 
and school and learning and life experiences. These connections enable students to build the foundation to confront 
challenges, grow socially and emotionally and excel academically in an environment that is nurturing, supportive and 
demanding. 

We adhere to the idea of “high expectations” whether it is manifested in teacher planning, units of study, classroom 
instruction and periodic assessments; a student who perseveres; a resourceful staff, demanding but fair leader or 
parents who demand their children achieve at high levels. 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Since we are a small school, we are able to provide a personalized learning environment that supports all students by 
providing one-on-one classroom instruction and a strong advisory program. This is especially important for our ELL 
and IEP5 Student, 75 percent of who read below grade level. Every child is known well by at least one adult in the 
school. This relationship enables teachers to keep students on track towards academic and social development goals. 
In addition, we take advantage of our small school setting to embed small group work providing numerous 
opportunities for all students including students with Individualized Educational Plans and English Language Learners 
to teach one another and to share knowledge through daily instruction and enrichment opportunities. We 
accommodate all IEP students' learning based on their IEPs while maintaining the same International Baccalaureate 
standards for all students. 

The culture of Science and Technology is grounded in the belief that every student can achieve educational and life 
success, if the highest expectations are held for students, and if the school staff, parents, faculty, and all members of 
the school community embody the same, shared values and expectations. Science and Technology Academy strives to 
become a world class community of enthusiastic life-long learners who are motivated by the pursuit of academic 
excellence allied with social responsibility. Our core values, Respect; Responsibility; Honesty; Integrity; Compassion; 
Generosity; and Fairness embody the supportive environment on the “Framework for Great Schools” These seven 
character themes pervade all aspects of our school environment and school life. The themes inform our instructional 
decisions, professional development and operational and management decisions. Coupled with rigorous instructions, 
our school’s success can be attributed to the strong culture of supportive environment for learning that we have 
created at Science and Technology Academy. We are a proud International Baccalaureate (IB) World School.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

IEP and ELL students struggle in reading and we are addressing with the "Mind Traveller's" reading program. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The community has become stronger as stronger relationships are built and this has led to improved student 
achievement.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Our Quality Review clearly indicates that our students understand learning outcomes prior to instruction and they 
assess their own learning against these outcomes. Classroom instruction demonstrates connection to students’ lives 
and high-quality experiences of rigorous dialogue and critical-thinking skills . We get credit for supporting students 
across classrooms to complete varied levels of required class activities. We need to work on our inquiry based 
approach to learning so it is consistent across classrooms. All students are known well by multiple adults. Our staff 
members frequently discuss and act together to improve learning and personal development of each student.  

Our students can articulate goals set for the year and understand their roles in meeting the goals. The advisory 
program allows for students to have a structured forum to get support and provides one adult who can advocate for 
each child. Based on our periodic assessments throughout the year, our students have made tremendous progress in 
English Language Arts and Mathematics. In September of 2017, thirty-four percent (31%) of our students were 
proficient in Mathematics and twenty seven percent (30%) proficient in English Language Arts; we anticipate a 
minimum of five percent (5%) growth in both subjects this year. According to the data from our "Cut Scores" and 
periodic assessments, we are making progress that will surpass our goal in Math.  

Our needs assessment is a school wide initiative regarding school-wide consistency about learning outcomes for all 
students, time in the classroom, grouping of students and academic rigor and relevance of instruction. Specifically, we 
discuss how to sustain our routines, instructional practices and learning environment to meet grade level 
expectations in all subjects for all students. We will continue our dialogue regarding quality of instructional time and 
how to maximize it through consistent and efficient structures for class openings, homework collection, within class 
transitions and formative assessment. Because we have a large population of students to whom English is a second 
language and other struggling readers, we provide ESL Pull-Out service to support the needs of ELL students.  

Looking at data in “CAP” and “ATS”, we have determined that Spanish is the home language in 65% of our students’ 
household. As a result, we provide community outreach in both English and Spanish. 55% of our staff members speak 
Spanish fluently and we provide translation during parent meetings, when making phone calls as well as in sending 
mails to parents. Our non-Spanish speaking teachers are supported by our community assistants, school secretary and 
school social worker.  

We have had a few challenges during the year. Because we have a large ELL population (22%) and a large IEP 
population (19%), we have struggled in providing meaningful differentiation of instruction. We made instructional 
decisions throughout the year using periodic and formative assessments, including student grouping and 
differentiation and targeting for interventions. Despite our challenges, we have had several success stories in addition 
to the improvement in our English Language Arts and Mathematics scores. Routines, instructional practices and our 
learning environment are consistent across classrooms and matched to meet grade level expectations in all content

areas as required by the International Baccalaureate organization Baccalaureate organization. In addition, our 
students own their assessments and learning data; they clearly understand its purpose, are involved in developing 
personal plans for improvement . 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

We will use our periodic assessments to measure student growth throughout the year because they are aligned fully 
to the state exam. We will conduct these exams twice a year to provide progress monitoring. We will be 25% toward 
our goal in November and 75% toward our goal in February. 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. 
We will use a data analysis tool called testwiz to measure student mastery of standards and use the conversion chart

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

We are a seventh year school with four hundred and fifty three students strong. In our first year, we logged six 
infractions in OORS. The number of infractions doubled in our second year and continued to increase through our 
seventh year. While this increase might be due to the increase in the number of students, we believe we need to do a 
better job of supporting our staff so they can improve their skills to creating classroom environment conducive to 
learning . 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, Seventy Five percent (75%) of staff will develop the skill to prevent disciplinary problems and create a 
respectful, collaborative a nd team based classroom and school culture through classroom management workshops 
from the dean and grade team leaders.

student work and attendance and incident reports to build academic rigor and enable students to think critically. The 
data is communicated to the community during our daily community meetings, in grade team meetings and faculty 
conferences. We are strong in maintaining a culture of mutual trust and positive attitudes towards learning that 
support the academic and personal growth of students. Our challenge is to engage more of our families in school 
decision making and in activities regarding student progress towards school expectations

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools

may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.

 

IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. 09X454, Mott Hall Science and Technology Academy, in compliance with the 
Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a 
parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and 
the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and 
decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the 
School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed 
members of the school community.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

[School name] will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36

children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and

Rationale: Over 46% of our ELL students are beginners and intermediate according to the 
NYSESLAT 2017. We purchased I-Ready licenses last year to support these students but we 
don't have enough space in our daily schedule to provide as much language acquisition support 
as we would like.  Our after school program provides the opportunity for this support

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
 
 
Rationale: Professional Development (PD) topics are guided by the needs of all students. PD is 
organized into units of study in which learning builds over time. PD takes place in core, content 
and grade teams and effectiveness of PD is assessed by formal and informal feedback from 
participants.  
Teachers to receive training: teachers participating in the after school program as well . 
Professional development workshops are facilitated by grade team leaders, ESL Coordinator, 
principal and Aussie consultants. The ELL teachers also meet once a week for additional PD. 
Professional Development Schedule:  
2 workshops on "using differentiation to improve learning for ELLs," Dec. 12, 2018 and Jan. 9, 
2019  provided by Ms. Ruiz 
2 workshops "discussing the common core challenges facing ELL students and using data to 
improve instruction for ELLs,” on Dec. 18, 2018 and Feb. 12, 2019 provided by Mr. Leblanc 
2 workshops on "supporting ELL students with the writing component of the Math and ELA 
bundles," on March 13, 2019 and April 7, 2019 provided by Mr. Worsley-consultant 
PD is provided all year long for literacy development and instructional support by assigned Mr. 
Worsley-Consultant. We also assign all ELL teachers to grade teams for collaborative work on 
using data to support instruction. ELL teachers will attend year round network Literacy and Math 
clinics to build capacity in the common core. Finally, all ELL teachers will attend International 
Baccalaureate (IB) workshops to build capacity in supporting inquiry based learning for ELL 
students. 
Record keeping: records of agendas, attendance sheets and literature provided during PDs will be 
maintained in a binder by the ELL Coordinator, Ms. Miriam Ruiz in the the ELL office room 
312. 
 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
All incoming 6th grade students, including ELLs, complete benchmark literacy and math assessments during summer 
orientation and in the first week of instruction. This data is supplemental to ELA, Math, and NYSESLAT assessment results from 
the prior spring administration, and forms a current picture of our incoming students. The I-Ready program uses an initial 
diagnostic and periodic assessments to determine student baseline and growth on lexile levels. Analysis of these assessment 
tools forms the basis for classroom assignment, ENL standalone and integrated instructional schedules, and in-class 
instructional grouping. This year, 16 incoming 6th grade ELLs had scored level 1 on the spring ELA administration, which 
prompted the development hetero-and homogenous instructional groupings in ENL to ensure that students' literacy needs 
were addressed. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The ENL Coordinator, literacy coach and bilingual staff collaborate to administer all entry level assessments at the beginning of 
the year. Then, we analyze the results in content and grade teams to decide the instructional materials and 
accommodations necessary to address students various levels of language proficiency. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
In both TBE and ENL programs, success will be gauged by progress on state assessments and student performance on 
formative in-class assessments for the IReady and Milestones programs.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

To ensure adequate growth by our English Language Learners we have weekly meetings with our bilingual staff in which we 
discuss student work samples, reading assessment data and teacher daily observations. We also align our ENL and 
HLA instruction using this data to address students' academic needs. We also utilize our after-school and Saturday Academies 
to address students' growth areas. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Not applicable 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
NYSITELL and NYSESLAT data reveal that 46% of ELLs at MHSTA are expanding and 40% are entering: 6th grade (59% 
expanding, 11% emerging, 30% entering), 7th grade (44% expanding, 9% emerging, 44% entering), and in 8th grade (30% 
expanding, 22% emerging, 48% entering).  Overall, more ELLs have been receiving service for 0-3 years (71%), followed by 
those with 4-6 years of service, (25%), and those with more than 7 years (3%). Our demographics present an additional 
challenge: 15% of ELLs overall have IEPs. These data highlight the need for intensive, needs-based instructional strategies to 
facilitate proficiency attainment, while addressing additional needs of ELLs receiving special education and resource services. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

After analyzing student NYSESLAT data, our bilingual staff creates an action plan to address students' academic needs in all 
strands of the language (listening, speaking, reading, and writing). This plan is then shared and discuss with all staff to provide 
the necessary tools for differentiation in all content areas. We also use the EDAT tool to program students for the required 
integrated ENL in Math and Science. We use our monthly ELL Data Update Report (EDUR) to ensure that all ELLs are 
appropriately programmed in STARS according to their proficiency level. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

ENL programs consist of 4 classes (200 minutes) weekly of integrated ENL for expanding students and 4 classes (200 
minutes) each weekly of integrated and standalone ENL for entering, emerging, and transitioning students. In the ENL 
program, the model used is integrated differentiated language instruction, and standalone ENL scaffolded for ELLs 
with IEPs in self-contained special education classes. For TBE and ENL programs, a certified ESL and/or bilingual

teacher works with the certified subject area teacher to provide English language scaffolding to support grade-level 
content for all levels of proficiency. In this program, we use block and heterogeneous grouping. ELLs in 6th-8th grades 
who receive ENL instruction remain with their home class for content instruction with push-in ENL and HLA support. 
Students in the 6th-8th grade general education TBE classes have a twice a week advisory class of ENL and reading 
skills, which is ungraded and homogenous: newcomer students in 6th-8th grade receive beginner ENL instruction, 
while transitioning and expanding students in all grades receive differentiated reading and writing instruction.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

TBE programs consist of eight classes of ENL (integrated/standalone) weekly (400 minutes) for entering, emerging and 
transitioning students. Expanding students have 4 classes weekly (200 minutes) of integrated ENL and 4 classes 
weekly (200 minutes) ELA. All students have 4-6 classes weekly (200-300 minutes) of HLA instruction (Math, Science). 
To accommodate the instructional needs and requirements of our heterogeneous TBE class populations, we provide 
ENL and HLA instruction within content classes using collaborative teaching methods and grouping based on academic 
and language proficiency levels. The organizational models used in the TBE program are self-contained, with push-in 
native language support in content areas (math and science), and pull-out differentiated ENL instruction based on 
language proficiency levels. TBE program models use block and heterogeneous grouping. There are three Spanish TBE 
classes: One general education 6th grade, one general education 7th grade, one general education 8th grade. ELLs in 
these classes include all levels of language proficiency.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           TBE programs consist of eight classes of ENL (integrated/standalone) weekly (400 minutes) for entering, emerging and 
transitioning students. Expanding students have 4 classes weekly (200 minutes) of integrated ENL and 4 classes weekly (200 
minutes) ELA. All students have 4-6 classes weekly (200-300 minutes) of HLA instruction. To accommodate the instructional 
needs and requirements of our heterogeneous TBE class populations, we provide ENL and HLA instruction within content 
classes using collaborative teaching methods and grouping based on academic and language proficiency levels. 
  
ENL programs consist of 4 classes (200 minutes) weekly of integrated ENL for expanding students and 4 classes (200 minutes) 
each weekly of integrated and standalone ENL for entering, emerging, and transitioning students.  
So far this year we have received three newly enrolled ELLs, 3 Spanish-speakers, who were placed in TBE based on parent 
choice. In addition, this year we have ELLs from six language groups (Spanish, Bengali, French, Arabic, Hindu, and Wolof). To 
ensure mandated instructional minutes and instructional needs of students are met at all language proficiency levels, we use 
flexible small group instruction based on ongoing assessments. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Content areas of math, science, and humanities/history include standard, varied, grade-level instruction for students in the 
TBE or ENL programs. All content courses are provided by instructors certified in their area, using native language where 
possible to make content comprehensible, and ESL scaffolding strategies to enhance language development. TBE history 
instructors are Spanish proficient; math and science instructors have the support of push-in bilingual/ESL certified teachers. All 
content courses use bilingual dictionaries and content-specific glossaries for student native language support, and the history 
class uses an English and Spanish version of the text. Math teachers use native language math assessments for periodic 
assessments. All TBE classes have bilingual and Spanish libraries. Students in TBE programs use Spanish texts and produce 
materials in English and Spanish, based on their proficiency level. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

   To ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native language, the HLA class in TBE programs incorporates ongoing 
formative and summative assessments in Spanish, for reading and writing. Content teachers provide translated versions of 
tests, and/or provide glossaries for students. Math teachers use Spanish versions of periodic assessments and annual exams. In 
addition, students in TBE classes complete the annual ELE (Examen de Lectura en Espanol) assessment every 
spring.  ELLs participating in our Free Standing ENL program are provided with formative and summative assessments in their 
native language as well. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Instruction is differentiated for all ELL subgroups. MHSTA uses the IReady program and extended instructional days (twice 
weekly, additional 2 hours instruction in reading and math) to build student strengths in language, literacy, and math. In 
addition, to these added instructional supports, the following instructional differentiation is provided for specific ELL 
subgroups: 
SIFE Students: SIFE students (currently there is 1 student in 6th grade, 3 in 7th grade, and 3 in 8th grade) receive additional 
instructional support via meetings with content teachers to discuss and address weaknesses. They receive weekly integrated 
and standalone ENL instruction, and attend extended day programs 5 hours per week for additional literacy and math support. 
Newcomers: Spanish-speaking newcomers receive native language instruction through the TBE program, use and have access 
to native language materials in all classes, and receive native language support from bilingual Spanish-speaking teachers and 
staff. Recently arrived students (less than one year in US schools) receive additional standalone intensive, structured ENL 
instruction. HLA instruction is aligned with ELA curriculum to benefit all ELLs, particularly those in their 2nd year of US schools 
instruction who will be tested in ELA for the first time. 2nd year ELLs complete periodic assessments in ELA, while 1st year ELLs 
complete ESL periodic assessments. 
Developing:  ELLs in US schools 4-6 years: Administrators and teachers analyze available and current test data (NYSESLAT, ELA, 
and Math, content areas assessments) to determine instructional areas of greatest need and target instruction accordingly to 
promote language acquisition in all four domains. In-class instructional grouping allows targeted intervention to promote 
progress and challenge.  
Long Term ELLs: Long-term ELLs (more than 6 years): Administrators and teachers analyze available and current test data 
(NYSESLAT, ELA, Math, periodic content assessments) to determine instructional areas of greatest need and target instruction 
accordingly to promote language acquisition in all four domains, with an emphasis on academic language building and 
application. In addition, these students are prioritized for receiving additional afterschool instruction in literacy and math.  
Former ELLs: ELLs achieving proficiency on NYSESLAT receive .5 unit of ENL services for two years. They will have continuing 
transitional support within classes from content teachers and ESL instructors who meet regularly to learn and apply ESL 
teaching methodologies to support continued language support and development. This year there are 28 proficient ELLs being 
monitored for progress and support: 5 6th graders, 12 7th graders, and 11 8th graders. All teachers at MHSTA participate in 
weekly group team meetings, at which individual student needs and instructional strategies are discussed. Teachers will also 
receive regularly scheduled professional development on ELL instructional strategies during the year through the Language 
Allocation Policy Team. Proficient ELLs continue to receive native language support using dictionaries and glossaries in all 
content classes, plus ELA and math support with IReady, and extended day ELA and math instruction. Former ELLs receive 
testing accommodations for up to two years after testing out, based on recommendations by classroom teachers for optimal 
student support.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ENL/bilingual instructors work with certified special educators and therapists to build language proficiency in accordance with 
students' other instructional and learning needs, and with mandated accommodations for individual students. All ELL-SWDs 
receive instruction from both special educators, and certified bilingual or ENL teachers, in self-contained, push-in, or pull-out 
settings depending on their assigned class and IEP. Teachers of ELL-SWDs provide access to academic content areas and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

accelerate English language development through the Milestones text series (Heinle-Cengage Learning), research-based 
curricula to build language in all domains, using text from a variety of content areas, including ELA, history, science, and math. 
The series contains both text, audio, and multi-media features to engage students. Classes are differentiated by proficiency 
level, to target specific areas of academic and English developmental needs, from entering to expanding students. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
To meet the needs of ELL-SWDs within the least restrictive environment, these students receive ENL or bilingual instruction as 
specified in their IEPs, in addition to mandated services in self-contained, collaborative team-teaching, or general education 
settings. ELL-SWDs who are in general education and ICT settings participate in all classes with their general education, non-
disabled peers. Those who are in self-contained (12-1 or 12-1-1) settings participate in P.E. and all non-instructional aspects of 
the school day with non-disabled peers from other classes. All ELLs, including ELL-SWDs, are eligible to attend extended day 
and Saturday academy programs, which are conducted in mixed student groups. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
MHSTA offers the following online intervention programs for ELLs in ELA and Math: 
ELA: MHSTA uses the IReady program for individualized, targeted reading intervention. This program is recommended and 
research-proven effective for ELLs and other students reading below grade level. The program is in English with a Spanish 
audio support component, plus additional native language support from ESL/bilingual certified instructors. In addition, ELLs 
attend the extended day program for additional 1:15 minutes of literacy instruction, including reading comprehension and 
writing skills. 
Math: ELLs attend the extended day program for additional 1:15 minutes of math instruction, including computation and 
grade-level concept skills.  
Social Studies and Science: we provide small group instruction and translation services for ELL students to ensure that they 
make progress in all content areas. Students that need extra support in these areas are identified for additional instruction 
during our afterschool program.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Based on current data and trends, we have identified that our newly arrivals are lacking basic skills in reading and writing in 
their native language-Spanish. To address this need, we have provided more integrated ENL services when possible for our 
TBE classes across the grades. Bilingual staff are co-teaching with content area teachers to provide extra support. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We have not discontinued any of our programs. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELLs at MHSTA have equal access to all school programs, including service learning roles, after school clubs, extended day 
instructional programs, AVID advisory class, and off-campus learning trips. We also offer after school and Saturday school 
programs for math and literacy development. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Instructional materials for ELLs include a range of bilingual Spanish texts and leveled readers in the content areas. All ELLs use 
IReady to build literacy skills, with access to both English and Spanish audio and text. This program has been proven to increase 
reading scores for all students, including ELLs, and is particularly effective for SIFE and long-term ELLs. Most classes are 
equipped with SmartBoards to promote multimedia accessibility, including alternate languages, plus all students use laptops 
for research and project-based learning in content classes. Students in the TBE program are able to submit writing and projects 
in their native language. History texts are provided in an English and Spanish version, for entering students in the Spanish TBE 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

programs. For the last two years, we have acquired Amazon kindle e-readers to support students literacy development. ELL 
students are able to borrow the kindles to take home with thousands of book selections that they can read at their reading 
level and interests. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support is delivered in the TBE program by bilingual Spanish certified instructors in HLA, and Spanish-speaking 
instructors in math, science and history. Spanish-speaking ELLs in the ESL program receive support from the ESL instructor who 
speaks Spanish, and bilingual paraprofessionals. Currently there are five languages represented in our ELL population, although 
Spanish is the only language shared by instructors. New ELLs of other languages are placed in classes with other native 
speakers, if possible (e.g. last year a Bengali-speaking student assigned a class with an English proficient Bengali student; two 
students from Senegal assigned the same class). We also provided them with bilingual glossaries and dictionaries. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

MHSTA opened in September 2009 with 6th grade class only, and is now at capacity with 6th, 7th, and 8th grade.  All 
instruction is linked to and guided by NYS 6th, 7th and 8th grade common core standards for content and literacy. All the 
services and resources are adapted for ELLs and SWDs according to their language proficiency and /or cognitive levels. 
Teachers use individualized student data to scaffold instruction such as creating graphic, modifying text density, and providing 
texts in their student native language 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
There are three schools located in our building but each in different floors. The only shared spaces are the cafeteria and 
auditorium. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
MHSTA conducts a summer orientation session for all students in August, two weeks before the first day of school. In this 
orientation, all students (including new ELLs) and their parents meet teachers, learn about class expectations and 
requirements, tour the school, and engage in team building activities to build friendships and school culture. Orientation also 
enables instructors to begin assessing student needs and begin planning instructional programs, including student grouping.  
We also have an ELL parent night in which teachers and parents discuss students’ academic goals and resources for 
instructional support. The following staff members maintain an open and constant communication with parents throughout 
the year through our newsletter and/or phone calls  as well: 
Ms. Miriam Ruiz / ENL Coordinator 
Ms. Sonja Fernandez/ Parent coordinator 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

7th and 8th grade students, including expanding ELLs in ENL programs, take Spanish language elective. Our entire 6th grade 
ELLs take Latin as well. Latin, as a foundational language of English, Spanish, and other romance languages, has been shown to 
assist ELLs and others in improving English vocabulary and grammar skills. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
ENL and HLA/bilingual instructors will attend various professional development workshops throughout the year, including the 
Language Allocation Policy (LAP) Development workshop in October. ESL/Bilingual-common branch and subject area teachers 
will attend additional workshops for working with English learners in the content areas throughout the year, including working 
with ELLs in math and content areas.  All teachers, including ESL/bilingual, common branch, and subject area teachers, 
participate in weekly grade team meetings to discuss student needs and instructional strategies across all content areas. ELL 
teachers have an additional weekly meeting specifically to share instructional best practices, targeted interventions, and 
address data-determined student needs. A Heinle representative is scheduled to attend these meetings throughout the year to 
provide ongoing training on using the Milestones language series currently used for ENL instruction at all grade levels. 
  
Tentative Schedule:   
2 workshops on "using differentiation to improve learning for ELLs," Nov. 15, 2017 and Jan. 17, 2018 provided by Ms. Ruiz 
2 workshops "discussing the common core challenges facing ELL students and using data to improve instruction for ELLs,” on 
Dec. 13, 2017 and Feb. 15, 2018 provided by Mr. Leblanc 
2 workshops on "supporting ELL students with the writing component of the Math and ELA bundles," on March 14, 2018 and 
April 4, 2018 provided by Aussie consultant 
Workshops on engaging ELLs using the common core learning standards are ongoing throughout the year at MHSTA. We have 
attended a professional development on assessing our ELL data and analyzing what standards students need the most help in. 
We have provided in house professional development for all staff on making content comprehensible for ELLs and scaffolding 
strategies. Records of PD participants, materials, and agendas will be kept by the ENL Coordinator. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Professional development is currently underway for all staff on promoting the critical thinking routines/writing routines that 
are necessary for high school. Teachers of 8th graders, including ELLs, meet weekly to ensure that English acquisition is linked 
to content and common core standards, and aligned with regents’ material. All 8th graders also receive weekly guidance on 
the High School application process, and preparation for High School setting and course-work. Our social worker supports 
students’ transition to high school by providing them with the information they need to effectively apply and find a good 
match for high school. 
To meet the new professional development requirements and as a continuation from last year, all MHSTA staff participate in 
our PD initiative on differentiation, which includes examination of expert knowledge on what is differentiation and how to 
apply it in the classroom, book analyses on differentiating instruction for all learners, dissecting case studies of differentiation 
across content areas, and finally, analyzing current lesson plans to observe evidence of differentiation. Staff meet with grade 
teams weekly to discuss school and student specific issues, and share best practice instruction for all subgroups, including ELLs. 
The school also has a formal professional development contract in progress for all staff:  AUSSIE Consultants will conduct 
ongoing sessions throughout the year, working with literacy and content teachers to increase effectiveness in classroom 
management and instructional differentiation, particularly with ELLs, at-risk students, and those with special needs. 
Participating staff include: Principal, Dean, ESL/Bilingual/common branch/subject area teachers, paraprofessionals, guidance 
counselor/social worker, secretaries, and parent coordinator. Copies of the agendas and sign-in sheets for all training sessions 
will be kept on file with the ENL coordinator.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
MHSTA provides an ELL parent night to meet with the parents or guardians of English language learners to discuss the goals of 
the program, their child’s language development progress, their child’s English language proficiency assessment results, and 
language development needs in all content areas. All our teachers participate to inform the parents or guardians about the 
child’s language development in all content areas in English and in the child’s home language (Spanish) in the case of students 
enrolled in a bilingual education program. This meeting is conducted with a qualified interpreter/translator (ENL or parent 
coordinator for Spanish, or a translation provider for other languages) in the language or mode of communication the parent 
or guardian best understands.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Parental involvement at MHSTA is fostered through PTA meetings, SLT meetings, and parent conferences. Curriculum night on 
September 26, 2017 was well-attended, involving many parents of current and proficient ELLs. Spanish translation was 
provided for all teacher presentations and to facilitate parent questions. The school’s bilingual Parent Coordinator is the 
parent of a proficient ELL, and several parents of ELLs ran for PTA office. In addition, parents of ELLs participate in all school 
events, including Student-Led conferences, Award Celebrations, Multicultural Day, and class trips. 
MHSTA also uses technology to promote parent involvement, including Engradepro, a web-based grading and communication 
system which allows students and their parents to check assignments and grades, and communicate with each teacher. Our 
automated voice messaging system leaves voice messages in Spanish for Spanish-speaking parents to make them aware of 
school events and requirements. Oral and written communication is always provided in the parent preferred language.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Dr. Patrick Awosogba, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

To keep track of our parents' preferred languages, we have created a Google doc that we update regularly. This 
report is designed to keep this information by grade and class. We use Part III of the Home Language Identification 
Survey (HLIS) to capture these languages. We also use the "Adult Preferred Language report" (RAPL and RCPL), 
students' blue emergency cards, and parent surveys to update this data. 
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

We will make available to parents all Chancellor's regulations regarding students' safety, health, legal and disciplinary 
issues and other areas in parents' dominant language. We will also maintain a record of the primary language of each 
family and we will make available translators to students and families when the request is made to conduct school 
business. The school will assure that the Multilingual Welcome Poster is visible in a conspicuous location of our 
school.

language access coordinator and parent coordinator will work closely together to create next steps based on the 
feedback from parents.
