Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our mission is to prepare students to reach their highest potential through a rigorous and authentic curriculum. Our 
school inspires students through academics, arts, and technology, to explore, create and achieve. Staff, students and 
parents are part of a larger community whose responsibility is to provide a safe and supportive environment for all to 
succeed. MS 131 offers a unique learning environment with a distinct philosophy to develop their critical thinking and 
problem solving skills in three habits:  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

Explore : Be curious. Be imaginative. To explore is to delve deeper into what you are curious about in order to create 
new thinking and connections. 

Create : Be inventive. Be innovative. To create is to make an ingenious product that illustrates and reflects your new 
thinking and connections.  

Achieve : Be accomplished. Be attained. To achieve is to carry out your effort, despite difficulty, in a way that you are 
proud of what you have created. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

At Dr. Sun Yat Sen Middle School 131, we are dedicated to serve all students in a whole child approach. We learn 
about each student's academic and socio-emotional needs and guide them in their crucial middle school journey by 
providing a warm and nurturing learning environment with high support of social emotions to reach their potentials. 
As a result, they will emerge to be curious life-long learners and independent thinkers motivated by the pursuit of 
academic excellence and social responsibilities. 

Other than the core content area classes, students will be also exposed with art, music, dance, foreign language and 
enrichment classes. Students are required to perform at least 20 hours of community services each year. Partnerships 
are formed with the intention of connecting the learning with the world of work and community services. They 
include Urban Advantage Middle School Science Initiative, Third Street Music, Urban Arts Partnership, Hester Street 
Collaborative, NYC Parks Department, YMCA, Big Brothers and Sisters, and other local community based 
organizations.  

As a school, we believe the saying of “It takes a village to raise a child.” Our success can only be obtained if all the 
stakeholders (students, parents, community members, staff, teachers, and administrators) work together to achieve 
the goal of educating our future generations.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

To support our diverse learners, MS 131 offers innovative courses that provide high academic challenges so that all 
students, including 32% of English Language Learners and 26% of Students with IEPs, will be held responsible to make 
connections through meaningful rigorous course work. In addition to the language supports of our ELLs, some have 
varying levels of schooling and often need additional support in content areas as well.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

In reference to the Framework for Great Schools, we, at MS 131, invest a great deal of effort in creating a supportive, 
safe and nurturing learning environment where students can focus on their learning and continue grow as individuals. 
Such supportive environment is built through the strong collaboration among teachers and school staff. The teaching 
staff is committed to providing the high quality of instruction to our diverse student population by tailoring their 
instruction to meet the different learning needs of our community. Teachers and staff value the professional learning 
opportunities and use each other as resources. As a result, trust is developed by all the stakeholders as we work 
toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing them for success in school and beyond. Respect is 
built among students, school staff, parents and administrators that we value each other.  

 

We will continue to challenge our students with rigorous instruction. In this school year, the focus of designing tiered 
tasks with assessment in mind will guide the active learning in the classrooms. Students will engage and interact with 
meaningful tasks as a way to deepen their understanding.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Principal Performance Review feedback revealed evidence that teaching practices are informed by the Danielson 
Framework and students are engaged in some level of meaningfully rigorous tasks that seek for high level of thinking. 
This is a strength, as it reveals that teachers understand the expectations of them, and they are in turn able  

1. We need to further refine teaching practices in providing effective multiple points of entry, support and extensions, 
and in questioning and discussion techniques so that all learners, including 32% of English Language Learners and 26% 
of Students with Disabilities, are meaningfully engaged in rigorous tasks and high level discussions.  

2. To further support our students in increasing their achievement outcomes, we need to strengthen assessment 
practices particularly in teachers providing actionable next steps to accelerate learning, ongoing checks for 
understanding throughout lessons and the units of study, and student self-assessment that lead to effective lesson 
adjustments as well as higher student achievement.  

On the ELA NYS Assessment in 2016-2017, the percentage of students achieving Level 1 was 26.2%, a 8.5% decrease 
(improvement) from 2016. In the June 2017 Instructional Report, the Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS) 
analysis of the ELA state assessment indicated that our students scored at least 5% below the citywide average in the 
areas of Key Ideas and Details and Craft and Structure with Informational Texts.  

Our priorities for this school year include: 

● Increasing teacher pedagogical knowledge in multiple points of entry, support and extensions, and questioning and 
discussions, especially around developing strong mastery around keys ideas and details, and craft and structure of 
informational texts.  

● Increasing students’ mastery to engage in high level texts and discussions that foster higher level of student thinking 
and work products. 

● Increasing students’ ownership of learning by self-assessing their learning and setting their own learning goals and 
actionable next steps, with the assistance of their teachers, in all content area classes 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
Teachers will implement various instructional strategies so that students can engage in high level texts and student led 
discussions that foster a higher level of thinking. Through their increased fluency and analytical abilities, the percentage 
of students receiving Levels 3 & 4 will increase between 3 to 5 % as measured by the results of the Spring 2019 New 
York State ELA Test.

1. To strengthen teaching practices in providing effective multiple points of entry, support and extensions, and in 
questioning and discussion techniques so that all learners, including 32% of English Language Learners and 26% of 
Students with Disabilities, are meaningfully engaged in rigorous tasks and high level discussions.  

2. To further support our students in increasing their achievement outcomes, we need to strengthen assessment 
practices particularly in teachers providing actionable next steps to accelerate learning, ongoing checks for 
understanding throughout lessons and the units of study, and student self-assessment that lead to effective lesson 
adjustments as well as higher student achievement.  

 

Our priorities for this school year include: 

● Working towards more student centered instruction, including the increased practice of student led discussion 

Increasing instructional coherence across grades so more structured collaborations between during common planning 
time result in enhanced student engagement.  

● Increasing utilization of structured protocols to analyze student work, and identify necessary instructional shifts in 
their practices which can then inform horizontal and vertical alignments of the curriculum, as well as alignment of 
strategies of individual student goals.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
Our focus is on utilizing meaningful tasks, academic vocabulary, quality discussion strategies to promote student-led 
discussions and increase deep learning in all content area classes. By December, all students will have engaged in 
student led discussion in at least 3 content area classes for a duration of 10 minutes or more. By June, all students will 
have engaged in student led discussion in all content areas for a duration of 10 minutes or more.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Recruitment 

● School leaders are responsible to put vacancies on the New Teacher Finder, and attend job fairs to recruit qualifying 
candidates. 

● School leaders form the personnel committee for recruitment and hiring purposes. The responsibilities of this 
committee are to screen applications and resumes, interview qualified candidates, observe demonstration lessons 
and provide feedback to candidates. The final decision on hiring is collaborative in which all members’ input and ideas 
are considered. 

Retention / Assignments 

School Leaders assign payroll secretary to ensure that all teachers meet documentation requirements that are kept on 
file. Payroll secretary works closely with the Network’s Director of Human Resources to ensure that all teachers meet 
all documentation and assessment deadlines. School leaders regularly check in with teachers to assess their teaching 
environment, continued passion on working with students and social emotional needs. Depending on the content 
areas, teachers usually receive assignments within the same grade level. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).

includes: 

● A committee of eight teachers and principal is formed for the purpose in selecting performance assessments as 
directed by DOE for teacher evaluation.  

● Teachers in content area teams design two to three common formative assessments and grading rubrics that are 
indicators of student performance and how instruction should be aligned to better meet the learning needs 
throughout the year.  

● Teachers in content area teams will collaboratively plan end of unit projects or assessment.  

Teachers at MS 131 participate in professional development in these following ways:

coaches and school leaders will design differentiated professional learning plans to address their needs.  

● Teachers will ask to share their feedback via PD evaluation each time.  

● Teachers have options on the type of professional development they will receive: one on one coaching, open time 
session on as needed basis, and peer visits. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. MS 131, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

MS 131 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Program #1:  Oral Speaking Class 
The necessity of this after school program grows out from two sources:  the results of the 2017-
2018 NYSESLAT results and teacher observations.   During observations for teacher evaluation, 
there was a striking pattern that many of our ENL students did not volunteer to speak.  They only 
spoke when directed by their teachers.  The language used in their speeches could incorporate 
more of the academic vocabulary.  Secondly,  52 % of our ENL students are at the beginner and 
intermediate levels in the Speaking and Listening Sections of the NYSESLAT. Therefore, we 
want to strengthen their speaking and listening skills by creating an oral speaking class after 
school to support their growth in these two essential areas with the use of academy vocabulary.   
  
The oral speaking class will primarily focus on building fluency in speaking and 
listening.  Students will role play different scenarios where they will take turns to speak and 
listen with specific academic vocabulary included.  Also, students will create dialogues that are 
relevant to their lives outside of school.  The second goal of this class is to develop their 
communication skills where students will build the language that specifically prepares them for 
social interactions with others in the context outside of their school lives.  They will create 
dialogues and practice with each other.  These discussions make to engage them outside of the 
school lives. For example, they would practice on questions they may ask when the got 
lost.   There will be two different classes each week;  a section for beginner level on Wednesdays 
and another section for intermediate level on Thursdays.  These sections will be in 90-minute 
blocks from 3:00-4:30 pm.  Sessions will begin on October 3, 2018, until June 12, 2019, a total 
of  32 weeks. A certified ELL teacher will instruct this after program class with 15-20 students 
for each section. 
 
The instructional materials for this class stem out from the needs of the students.  Teachers will 
use books such as to practices with students.  Also, we also utilize Raz-Kids, an online reading 
program to practice the listening skills.

Program #2: Exploring Chinatown History  
 
The necessity of this after school program grows out from two sources:  the results of the 2016-
2017 NYSESLAT results and the analysis of student work.   When examining student work, we 
noticed that our ENL students were writing in simple sentences that weren't necessarily fully 
expressing their ideas.   We wanted to use this cultural experience to build their stamina in 
writing compound sentences first, then building onto more complex sentences that enable them 
to articulate their thoughts more comprehensively.  
 
22 English language learners in grades 7 & 8  will participate in a community documentation 
project through animation and videography where the students will peruse videos and 
photographs from the Museum of Chinese in the Americas collection and be introduced to the 
ways in which photos and videos function as historical documents. Through a guided inquiry 
study with a focus on learning, critical thinking, and problem solving, the students will begin to 
interpret photographs for use in understanding the Chinese community, its people, places and 
events as well as to build on literacy and social studies skills by utilizing reading, writing, 
listening, and speaking as tools for learning English. The materials and supplies needed for the 
culminating project that will be funded by Title III money are consumable supplies such as 
batteries, ink cartridges, photo paper, trade books, etc. In line with the school’s instructional 
practice, the after school program will also implement instruction in small groups where the ESL 
methodologies are embedded in a balanced literacy approach. The class will have 
an ESL Science teacher and a special education teacher (as there are a number of 
SETSS students in the group) to provide small group instruction, in literacy to ensure that the 
individual needs of the English language learners are addressed. These two teachers will 
collaboratively plan lessons for the after school program.  Both teachers will instruct the students 
through a variety of models like parallel teaching, station teaching, and small group instruction 
based on needs. 
    
 
  
The focus will primarily be on the documentary filmmaking and animation as a way to study the 
community. Students will research the Chinatown community, explore the components of 
filmmaking and animation, and discuss the process of storytelling through filmmaking and the 
ideas or opinions filmmaking and animation express. Students will learn how videography and 
animation can inform them about the history and transformation of the Chinatown community. 
They will use videos and photographs from present day to compare and contrast the past and 
present Chinatown community to help in understanding the transformation of the people and its 
community. The students will produce written scripts for the film to help them better understand 
how pictures can tell stories. The focus for this curriculum will primarily be on filmmaking and 
animation as a way to study the community. They will learn that filmmaking and animation can 
be an essential tool for making their community more meaningful. The students will learn the 
skills and techniques for preserving and presenting their community stories through filmmaking 
and animation. They will learn to conduct interviews, the art of good questioning techniques,

Teachers who service ENL students will engage in an inquiry cycle (Instructional Triad), which 
three teachers will meet and discuss the school instructional focus on engaging students with 
focused academic talks, in particularly in the areas of student questioning, peer discussions and 
the use of academic language. 
 
The inquiry cycle consists of the following: 
Week 1:  A teacher in the triad will share articles/videos / tools (checklists/rubrics) that are 
related to their work that directly impacts on their growth with the school focus. The triads will 
discuss these materials in length and connect to their current work. 
Week 2:  The teacher will bring a lesson plan to the triad.  Through a structured protocol: Tuning 
Protocol to examining lesson plans, other members will provide warm and cool feedback to the 
teachers to further align the lesson plan to meet the learning targets of that lesson.  As all 
teachers are responsible for teaching ENL students in our school, these lesson plans are written 
to address their needs.   
In Between Weeks 2 and 3,  Teachers in the triad will visit a class in which the lesson is 
executed. 
Week 3: Teachers will return to debrief and reflect upon the experience. Each teacher will reflect 
and think about fine tuning practices that further strengthen their work on student talks.  
Week 4 to 6:  The same process repeats for the second teacher. 
Week 7 to 9:  The same process repeats for the third teacher.

Our parental involvement will manifest in different ways: 
  
First, we began with parents being surveyed during the monthly parents’ meeting to get feedback 
that we could use in creating our afterschool programs.  As a result, we have created two 
programs to address these suggestions of the parents. In June parents will be surveyed again to 
determine their opinion on the programs and their success.  
 
Program #1:  Oral Speaking Class 
Parents are invited to the oral speaking class where their children will demonstrate what they 
learned through skits and scenarios.  Also, students in the program will teach parents how to hold

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our ESL teachers use the Reading A to Z Program of the Raz-Kids Program to assess the students reading levels, which align 
with the Fountas and Pinnell reading levels. The running records help the teachers assess the students’ nonfiction independent 
reading levels.  This information gathered is used to group students for ENL classes. Teacher use this information to set goals, 
plan and adjust their lessons, form small group instructions, work with students in goal setting and measure their progress 
during the school year . Students’ reading levels are assessed three time during the school year: at the beginning of the school 
year, in January and in June. This information is shared with the content area teachers to support students understanding of 
the subjects. Content Area Teachers use this information to select reading materials that are appropriate for students and 
differentiated instruction. Students are also informed of their reading levels and know how to select appropriate reading

materials. 
  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
At MS 131 we look at the results of the NYSESLAT to determine the amount of students that have passed the test and moved 
into regular education classes. We also use the NYSESLAT data to determine student progress during the three years at our 
school. Another source we use is the ELA test to assess the growth of our ELLs. 
   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
As we studied the NYSESLAT results for our school we found:   That a total of 18 students passed the NYSESLAT this year.    In 
the 6th grade 16 students are at the advanced level (12 Regular Education, 4 Special Education), 6 students are on the 
intermediate level ( 4  Regular Education, 2 Special Education) and 13 are at the beginner level (11 RegEducation,  2 Special 
Education) In the 7th grade 27 students are on the advanced level (18 Regular Education,  9      Special Education) and, 10 
students are on the intermediate level ( 4  Regular Education,  6  Special Education)  and 28 are at the beginner level ( 18 
Regular Education, 10  Special Education).   In the 8th grade 20 students are on the advanced level ( 18  Regular Education, 2 
Special Education)  , 18 students are on the  intermediate level ( 18 Regular Education,  0  Special Education) and 31 are at the 
beginner level ( 29  Regular Education,  2  Special Education). 
  
  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

        Students in the freestanding ENL program travel together as a group for our content area classes.  For ENL class, 
they are divided homogeneous into two smaller groups which are taught by two licensed ENL teachers. The 
proficiency level is based on the NYSELSAT results as well as the baseline assessment administered at the beginning of 
the school year.  Usually, students in the Emerging and lower Transitioning Levels are grouped together while 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

students in the higher Transitioning and Expanding Levels are grouped together.   
  
  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Students who have selected the TBE program at our school are students in the Entering and Emerging Levels along 
with our newcomers.  In similar fashion, our ENL classes are in reduced class size where two licensed ENL teachers 
share the students.  When learning the content area classes, they travel as a group.  
  
  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Our newly formed LD Program travel as a group.  They are co-taught by a licensed ENL teacher and a common branch 
teacher.  They travel as a group for the core content area classes. 
  

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

                              All ESL classes are assigned two ESL licensed teachers who divide the class into two smaller groups to provide 
8, forty-five minute periods of ENL and ELA instruction.  ENL students receive content area instruction in English using ENL 
methodologies to support the students’ learning of the content area.   All transitional bilingual classes are assigned two ESL 
licensed teachers who divide the class into two groups to provide 8 periods of ENL a week. All content area classes are taught 
by content area teachers with a bilingual extension using the language allocation percentages. Beginners and intermediate 
students receive 360 minute a week in ENL and advance students receive 180 minutes in ENL, 180 minutes in ELA and three 45 
minute periods of Native Language Arts.  TBE students will  be expected to receive 75% of instruction in their home language 
and 25% in English as the year progresses. 
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
                Students in the ENL freestanding program receive instruction in English in the content areas using scaffolding to  
support the understanding and development of the language. In Social Studies and Science the teachers use  
pictures, graphic organizers, Venn diagrams, T-charts and technology to scaffold the learning. Students use the  
writing process to draft, edit and publish their work. Bilingual dictionaries and word study support scaffolding  
strategies used in class. Teachers also provide visual aids such as pictures, photographs, diagrams, charts  
documents and videos to support the learning. Sentence starters and modeling also play an important part in the  
everyday lessons and procedures. Teachers have also been trained in using reading in the content areas where  
students reading levels are shared by the ENL teachers and workshops have been provided to help content teachers  
understand the meaning and implications of these different abilities and levels. Teachers provided reading materials  
on different reading levels of the same content.  Teachers’ front load the new vocabulary before reading reread and  
annotates while reading and summarizes and respond after reading. In mathematics students work in groups and use  
manipulative to understand the concepts. Students will summarize what they have learned and what they are  
struggling with at the end of a session.   Students in the bilingual program receive instruction in Chinese in the content areas 
using the language allocation policy percentages recommended supporting the understanding and development of the English 
language, while maintaining the Chinese language.   Teachers have also been trained in using reading in the content areas and 
citing textual evidence to support analysis of what the text says explicitly as well as inferences drawn from text 
(CCLS).   Students reading levels are shared by the ENL teachers and workshops have been provided to help content teachers 
understand the meaning and implications of these different abilities and levels have in the understanding of the content 
materials. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

  
   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

                In the bilingual classes students are tested in the language of instruction; students are offered the option of taking  
the state test in English or having both, the English and the Chinese or Spanish test. These tests are requested by the  
content area teacher for their students and provided on the testing date. Students are assessed informally through  
their responses to text and through journals. Students write their native language and use English more and more as  
the year goes by. When students arrive at our school they take Chinese Language Arts test that gives students and  
teachers the level of Chinese students enter with and at the end of the school year they take the State Chinese  
Language Arts exam. 
  
   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a.   Students that are identified as SIFE receive extra help in English during our Module 45 minutes 3 times a week classes. The 
curriculum used is developed by our ENL department lead by our ENL coach. 
  
b. Students that have been in the country less than three years receive conversational English classes after  
school two hours a day, two days a week by a licensed ESL teacher.  In addition they receive English Language Support 
Modules for 45 minutes, 3 times a week.  
  
c. Students that have been in the country four to six year participate in the after school program that focuses on the 
development of reading and writing skills through the lens of immigrant history in New York City’s Chinatown.  This program 
meets  twice a week for two hours each day to learn English through an immigrant curriculum which has been developed by 
our ENL teachers and modified each year to meet the needs of the current group.  This year and last,  this particular after 
school program is in partnership with museum educators from the Museum of Chinese-Americans (MoCA).  
  
d. Students that have been ELLs for six or more years are also invited to participate in the Immigrant program;  
they are also targeted during the day for an ENL module class three times a week by a licensed ENL teacher. 
  
e. All former ELLs are given additional literacy support by ENL teachers during small group module classes. Furthermore, the 
current teachers have been trained to identify these students and scaffold class materials to ensure their engagement in class. 
  
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 All teachers use ESL methodologies embedded in a balance literacy approach. Instructional practices included close 
reading,  shared reading, guided reading, read aloud, think aloud, independent reading, journal writing, writers’ notebooks, 
read and retell, modeling, active listening, and speaking, presentations and reading celebrations. The teachers use the 
Teachers’ College Reading and Writing Workshop model. Teachers use the benchmark assessment from Reading A-Z this 
program to determine students’ reading levels which is aligned to Fountas and Pinnel system. Teachers use this data to put 
students in instructional group.   The data is reviewed three times a year.  Teachers also use conferring notes to monitor their 
abilities and plan instruction.  Our ELLs with special needs are also mainstreamed for arts, physical education, advisory and 
enrichment where they share the same curriculum as the general education population. In these classes students work in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

groups and partnerships. There is collaboration amongst the students to complete a task, project or game. All students 
participate in celebrations, such as Halloween, Thanksgiving, Awards Ceremonies, College Visitations, Spring Arts Shows and 
High School Fairs. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our Special Education teachers attend our ENL Department meeting once a week for every week, during  
this time teachers work and refine the English curriculum that addresses listening, speaking, reading and writing needs of our 
ELLs based on the results of periodic assessment which are administered three times a year, daily formative assessment and 
running records.  One of the programs we use to address the needs of our SWD is Reading A-Z. This program address all 
reading levels and provides activities that address the independent levels of the students with special needs. The program also 
has a benchmark assessment which is given by the teachers to measure students’ progress throughout the school year. Our 
ELLs with special needs are also mainstreamed for arts, physical education, advisory and enrichment where they share the 
same curriculum as the general education population. In these classes students work in groups and partnerships. There is 
collaboration amongst the students to complete a task, project or game. All students participate in celebrations, such as 
Halloween, Thanksgiving, awards ceremonies, high school fairs and other school wide activities,where they interact with their 
grade level peers in English. 
  
  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
ELL students offered small group interventions such as Judy Hochman’s Teaching Basic Writing Skills for writing development, 
math focused on skills based intervention using Khan Academy, an online skills based tutoring forum,  in English.  In addition, 
ELL students are offered with homework support three days a week, one day with a bilingual licensed teacher, one day with 
science teacher  and the last day with a special education teacher.    
  
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We are going to continue training our ENL teachers with the Wilson program to help our ELLs that are struggling  
reading, and our ELLs with disabilities. We will also maintain and improve our units through the integration of formative 
assessments and the use of data to drive our instruction.  We are also introducing a Dual Language class which will mirror our 6 
grade English Class.   
  
  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

As of now we do not plan to discontinue any services.    
  
  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Our ELLs represent approximately 32%of our school population.  They fully participate in the programs the school  
provides. The ELLs take part in all school events, assemblies, and celebrations.  There are Halloween, Thanksgiving  
and Chinese New Year celebration, as well as, field day and trips, such as, the senior trip in June. The students  
belong to the student government and peer mediation. All correspondence letters and announcements are translated for the 
student and the parents.   Students have joined the badminton, basketball and volleyball after school program on 
Wednesdays/Thursdays/Fridays. Student who will take the ELA exam have Module Classes which are small group instruction 
support to strengthen their writing. Students in the beginners and intermediate levels participate in the after school

Chinatown History Program and an Conversational English programs.  Other students will participate in the Student 
Government Organization (SGO), Dance, Chess and base guitar programs. These are all supplemental programs for our ELL 
students to use their English in other setting and disciplines. 
  
  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All ELLs have full access to technology in all their classes where laptops are available. In ENL students use the laptops to 
research nonfiction topics, as well as, to type their final drafts. Some students use Google translate for individual words. All 
ENL teachers have leveled libraries which tiered trade books by genres and topics are provided to support the ELLs’ reading 
levels through Reading A-Z, an online program.  Students can access the Reading A to Z outside of school with specific log in 
information.   In the content areas teachers are provided with bilingual dictionaries in English and Chinese and content area 
related topics books in both languages for classroom libraries. The teacher usually reads aloud the text as a share reading 
experience. The goal is for the students to hear the language and make connections to the written words and phrases. 
Students then have the opportunity to practice reading strategies and responses both orally and in writing.  
  
  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language support is delivered three times a week for 45 minutes through our Chinese Language Arts class 
for bilingual class. Chinese is also used in the content areas to deliver instruction using the percentages suggested  
by the CR Parts 154.  In the Dual Language Program, Chinese Language Arts Class is scheduled for five periods a week (each 
period is 45 minute.)   
  
  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Services are not only age appropriate for our middle school students but also language appropriate.  At MS 131 we  
have a bilingual Chinese counselor and a bilingual Chinese social worker and a bilingual Spanish Social Worker. Our support 
services staff is bilingual and has many years of experience working with ELLs. 
  
  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
All ELLs have full access to technology in all their classes where laptops are available. In ENL students use the laptops to 
research nonfiction topics, as well as, to type their final drafts. Some students use Google translate for individual words. All 
ENL teachers have leveled libraries which tiered trade books by genres and topics are provided to support the ELLs’ reading 
levels through Reading A-Z, an online program.  Students can access the Reading A to Z outside of school with specific log in 
information.   In the content areas teachers are provided with bilingual dictionaries in English and Chinese and content area 
related topics books in both languages for classroom libraries. The teacher usually reads aloud the text as a share reading 
experience. The goal is for the students to hear the language and make connections to the written words and phrases. 
Students then have the opportunity to practice reading strategies and responses both orally and in writing.  
  
  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Students and parents are offered a new student orientation in both languages in August. Invitation letters that are sent home 
are in both languages during the summer.  Incoming students have the opportunity to go on a tour of the building with a staff 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

member. New students will also be paired up with a student in their class who will explain the schedule and who will walk 
them around the building to important destinations. The students will also receive a planner and a family handbook that is in 
Chinese. This planner explains important rules and regulations, as well as, important tips on how to succeed at MS 131. Some 
examples are the getting organized, ready to learn, text coding and SEEK (how to write a strong and clear paragraph).  The 
family handbook outlines the expectations of school policies and students/parents responsibilities to meet these 
expectations.   For those who enroll throughout the year, we also provide a new student orientation every four to six weeks 
with similar actvities.  
  
  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

We offer Mandarin Chinese to our ELLs.  
  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

a. We are starting our DL program this school year.  We currently have a side by side model with 50% of 
the content in Mandarin Chinese.  The population we currently have is slightly more Ells, which is due to 
not having a feeder dual language elementary school.   However we are continuing to attempt to have a 
50/50 model among our EPs and ELLs.   
  
b. We are teaching content in Mandarin Chinese.   
  
c. ELA/ESL class is taught in English at all times.  Chinese Language Arts is taught in Chinese at all times. 
The rest of the core content area classes are taught in both English and Chinese.  PE, Arts and Advisory 
classes are taught in English.  
  
d.   We are using a sequential model as our students need to build their foundation in the target 
language.  
  
  
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
At MS 131 all ESL teachers meet once a week with the ENL coach and the assistant principal. This year the focus 
is on the development of the Pacing Calendar, ENL units, formative assessment, implementation and evaluation of the reading 
A-Z program and using data to drive instruction. Our content  bilingual content teachers will be receiving going training on the 
use of reading in the content areas, scaffolding for ELLs and using data to drive the instruction. All staff will receive scaffolding 
strategies for reading and using data to drive instruction.

Teacher will receive professional development by the ENL coach throughout the year as they work on planning and developing 
the curriculum units using the CCLS. 
  
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
ELLs transitioning into high school are provided with support through the advisory curriculum design to support  
students through this process. All advisory teachers are provided with a copy of the curriculum at the beginning of the school 
year. Students are also provided with a bilingual counselor and social worker that meet with them to support this process. 
Social workers and counselors attend all citywide PD provided in order to maintain students updated with the most current 
information. Staff is provided with a curriculum developed by our bilingual social worker for their advisory period and PD to 
support the curriculum provided. 
  
  
Staff will receive training on best practices in scaffolding reading in the content areas provided by our instructional coaches. All 
staff will receive scaffolding strategies for reading and using data to drive instructions. Attendance will be taken and teachers 
will be provided with a folder of materials. A document on google will be provided where teacher will keep the data collected 
and it's analysis.  ENL, DL and Bilingual Teachers will receive (15%) professional development dedicated to language 
acquisition, with a  focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies  for all bilingual and English as a new language teachers.    
  
  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
MS 131 is planning to use the Tuesday Parent Engagement Time to meet with individual parents discussing student goals and 
progress.  Teachers will create a schedule where they can meet with the parents between the month of January and May.   
  
  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Ell parents attend our Parent Association meetings, Principal Breakfast, Honor Rolls and come in daily as they need letters, 
academic updates and social emotional and concrete supports.  This year we are inviting our ELL parents to a breakfast for 
students their Dads or Significant Male role models.  In addition, we offer workshops on a variety of topics such as adolescent 
depression, financial literacy for college.   The Parent Association holds a monthly parent meeting on the first Thursday, when 
the principal attends the meeting as well.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Phyllis Tam, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
