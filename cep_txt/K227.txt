This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our families and students. Strong Schools, Strong Communities The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult. The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students. The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for students. Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members concrete ways to improve. In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing that it likely addresses other elements as well. The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value each other. The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative and qualitative data. NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below: I. Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) II. School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4) III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) School Quality Guide The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, professional development, and parent and family engagement. To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:   It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) Next Steps for CEP Development School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school community know when you’ve reached your goal.  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to accomplishing desired results. Section 4: CEP Overview 1.

To be eligible for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated. Program Name Fund Source (i.e. Federal, State or Local) Funding Amount Indicate the amount contributed to Schoolwide pool. (Refer to Galaxy for school allocation amounts) Place an (X) in Column A below to verify that the school has met the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated. Indicate in Column B, section references where a related program activity has been described in this plan. Column A Column B 6  Title I Part A (Basic) Federal Title II, Part A Title III, Part A Title III, Immigrant Federal Federal Federal Tax Levy (FSF) Local $1,246,387 0 $58,574 0 $10,745,927 x x x Verify with an (X) Section Reference(s) 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E Section 6 5B, 5C, 5D,Section 6 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E Section 6 1Explanation/Background: Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students. Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds. Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different sources when accounting for their use.  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended beneficiaries are met. 2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as follows:  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs 7   Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional program.  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency.

Parent involvement activities funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education designed to meet their individual needs.   Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application. 8  Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC) (Required for All Title I Schools) Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy. Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. Parent and Family Engagement Policy Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of parents and community in the school. Edward B. Shallow 20K227, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families.

The school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school. In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? The ENL teacher is responsible for conducting the initial screening, and administering the HLIS AND NYSESLAT. They also administer the Spanish NYSITELL to students who have been identified as having Spanish as their language spoken at home. When new students come to register, the ELL Coordinator, a licensed ESL teacher, reviews the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) and conducts the informal oral interview. For languages other than Spanish, the ELL Coordinator utilizes the translation unit or available bilingual staff members. Within ten days, the ELL Coordinator administers the NYSITELL, if indicated by the HLIS. Using the information from the NYSITELL/NYSESLAT Eligibility Roster (RLER) ATS report, English Language Learners are evaluated annually using the New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLST). The current results of the NYSESLAT are used to program mandated services. Entering and Emerging students receive a minimum of 360 minutes of instruction per week, through a combination of stand-alone and integrated instruction. 5  Transitioning and Expanding students receive a minimum of 180 minutes of instruction per week, through a stand-alone and integrated instruction. Commanding students receive a minimum of 90 minutes of service per week. Formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments created by teachers are given monthly and data is analyzed to inform continuous instructional planning as needed for all ENL students at all levels. 2. What structures do you have in place to support this effort? The ENL Coordinator, Principal, and Assistant Principal of ENLs utilize the current RLAT to determine placement for appropriate programming for the current year. The ENL Coordinator follows the guidelines the administering the NYSITELL for newly admitted students, and places them accordingly into an appropriate program. Newly admitted students are placed in an appropriate program within ten school days of entry. Placements are reviewed and monitored by the ENL Coordinator, Principal, and Assistant Principal of ENLs for appropriateness. All ENL students are provided with 420 minutes of instruction by a certified ENL teacher complimented by the mandated hours as prescribed by the state. 3. What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? Based on identified areas of improvement we have put into place various programs, which are analyzed quarterly for effectiveness and growth. We have established a schedule of intervisitations to share best practices, organized Inquiry Teams to look at student work and devise interventions that address individual student needs, have introduced school wide monthly formative assessment practice in all content areas, have programmed teacher led peer tutoring, and small group intervention periods as professional activities, in addition to support growth we offer targeted professional development to support instructional expectations. Additionally, we survey teachers for a more comprehensive approach to our programs and continue to analyze the data and tailor instruction accordingly. 4. What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered? We have established a schedule of intervisitations to share best practices, organized Inquiry Teams to look at student work and devise interventions that address individual student needs, have introduced school wide monthly formative assessment practice in all content areas, have programmed teacher led peer tutoring, and small group intervention periods as professional activities, in addition to support growth we offer targeted professional development to support instructional expectations. Additionally, we survey teachers for a more comprehensive approach to our programs and continue to analyze the data and tailor instruction accordingly. To further explain, All ENL students are provided with 420 minutes of instruction by a certified ENL teacher complimented by the mandated hours as prescribed by the state. Lessons are provided at different lexicon levels, multi-tiered and address the areas of listening, speaking, reading and writing. Formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments created by teachers are given monthly and data is analyzed to inform continuous instructional planning as needed for all ENL students at all levels. Areas of need are identified and improvement cycles are put into place with various programs, which are analyzed quarterly for effectiveness and growth. To assist teachers we have established a schedule of inter-visitations to share best practices. In addition we have cohort organized Inquiry Teams to look at student work and devise interventions that address individual student needs. 5. How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.] All ENL students are provided with 420 minutes of instruction by a certified ENL teacher complimented by the mandated hours as prescribed by the state. Teacher confer with students every week to collect notes on progress related to the four modalities of Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing. Lessons are provided with different modalities with the use of technology and leveled software. Areas of need are identified and improvement cycles are put into place with various programs, which are analyzed quarterly for effectiveness and growth. When needed students are supplemented with AIS and or SETSS services to remedy deficiencies. 6  6. What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS]. SubGroups Total 6 7 8 CM 78 22 25 31 EM 67 17 22 28 EN 72 18 38 16 EX 219 86 76 57 TR 92 25 33 34 528 168 194 166 Shallow's largest subgroup of ENLs have an expanding proficiency level, followed by entering proficiency level. 7th grade presents the largest gain of a commanding level, followed 8 th grade. Expanding level students across all grades prove to have the largest gains achieving language proficiency. The emerging and transitioning proficiency level has the least amount of students across the grades. 7. What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? Lessons are provided at different lexicon levels, multi-tiered and address the areas of listening, speaking, reading and writing. Formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments created by teachers are given monthly and data is analyzed to inform continuous instructional planning as needed for all ENL students at all levels. Professional Development is then created to address all areas of concern and teach and inform all team members of new targets and goals. A schedule of inter visitations to share best practices is provided to teachers so that we all create and share a common language and common practices. Through weekly organized Inquiry Teams look at student work and devise interventions that address individual student needs, have introduced school wide monthly formative assessment practice in all content areas, have programmed teacher led peer tutoring, and small group intervention periods as professional activities, in addition to support growth we offer targeted professional development to support instructional expectations. Additionally, we survey teachers for a more comprehensive approach to our programs and continue to analyze the data and tailor instruction accordingly. Part IV: ELL Programming Programming and Scheduling Information 1. How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in one class]). a. Freestanding ENL program. All instruction is conducted in English; EN and EM levels of English proficiency receive two units (420 minutes) of ENL instruction: One unit stand alone and one unit of integrated instruction with a certified ENL service provider in ELA. As mandated by the state TR and EX students receive one unit of ENL integrated instruction (180 minutes) and one unit of ELA (180 minutes) with a certified ENL service provider in ELA. 7  CM students receive .5 units of integrated ENL services with a certified ENL service provider. Students receiving ENL are grouped by Mixed proficiency level by grade. Through an integrated model students receive ENL/ELA instruction according to their proficiency levels on the NYSESLAT. b. TBE program. If applicable. N/A c. DL program. If applicable. N/A 2. How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each program model? a. How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 below)? All ENL students are provided with 420 minutes of instruction by a certified ENL teacher complimented by the mandated hours as prescribed by the state. Lessons are provided at different lexicon levels, multi-tiered and address the areas of listening, speaking, reading and writing. All instruction is conducted in English; Students receiving ENL are grouped by Mixed proficiency level by grade. As mandated by the state : EN and EM levels of English proficiency receive two units (420 minutes) of ESL instruction: One unit stand alone and one unit of integrated instruction with a certified ENL service provider in ELA. As mandated by the state TR and EX students receive one unit of ESL integrated instruction (180 minutes) and one unit of ELA (180 minutes) with a certified ENL service provider in ELA.

Through an integrated model students receive ENL/ELA instruction according to their proficiency levels on the NYSESLAT. 3. Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards. Students remain in a blended general education environment for content areas. The ESL component of the mixed class is proficiency based. Students receive instruction in English with a focus on vocabulary. Teachers are trained in ESL methodologies and strategies. In addition PD has been incorporated throughout the year to support the general education content area teachers. All teachers receive 15% their professional development in lanugage acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for ELLS. ENL teachers receive 50% of the latter. Records are maintained by using a sign in sheet. Students participate in the ELA, Math and other content areas of instruction with non ELL students. Ell students in stand-alone settings are taught using the Keystone Program, which is aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. This is a three-level English language learning program based on the systematic development of skills and strategies. The program comes with a students workbook, an annotated teacher’s edition, an audio program, an assessment guide, resources for teachers, resources for students, transparencies, videos and student cd-rom. The program is designed to help students learn the English they need for the different school subjects. Each selection has a variety of topics, including, science, math, and social studies. ELA instruction -The continued implementation of a Balanced Literacy Approach in ELA: Classroom libraries and academic support personnel in the classroom. Science instruction- ELL students follow the same pacing calendar as the English Proficient (EP) students. JHS 227 uses McGraw Hill text book. This text book features many graphic organizers, which allow ELLs to see the lesson’s information visually. It helps them organize, summarize information and to remember the content of the lesson. Social Studies- As with science for social studies instruction, ELLs follow the same pacing calendar as the E.P. students. Student in the six grades use the Our World’s Story textbook by Harcourt Brace and Company. Students in seven and eight grade are 8  using the Holt McDougal, United States History and New York History: Beginnings to 1877. Students are taught how to analyze written sources (primary and secondary,) artifacts, historical maps, photographs, political cartoons and become active readers. Content areas teachers receive professional development on how to differentiate for ELLs. Math Instruction - Includes the implementation of daily writing activities using CMP3 Math and is supplemented by Hot Words, Hot Topics. Our ELL receive the same instruction in math as E.P. students. Academic Intervention Services (AIS) are provided to meet the needs of all students who require additional assistance to meet the NY State standards in ELA. Although the intensity of the services provided vary, based on the individual needs of students, all grade 6-8 students performing in Levels 1 and 2 and all students deemed to be at risk, including students with disabilities and English Language Learners, will receive appropriately targeted services. Former ELLs are included in AIS services on of the following AIS services ; Jamestown Reading Navigator, Read 180 ,SRA, AMP, River Deep , and Focus on Literacy. 4. How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? While NLA is not part of our parental choice program, the native language is supported throughout the school year with NLA libraries. Based on identified areas of improvement we have put into place various programs, which are analyzed quarterly for effectiveness and growth. We have established a schedule of intervisitations to share best practices, organized Inquiry Teams to look at student work and devise interventions that address individual student needs, have introduced school wide monthly formative assessment practice in all content areas, have programmed teacher led peer tutoring, and small group intervention periods as professional activities, in addition to support growth we offer targeted professional development to support instructional expectations. Additionally, we survey teachers for a more comprehensive approach to our programs and continue to analyze the data and tailor instruction accordingly. 5. How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? SIFE a. b. Newcomer c. Developing d. e. Long Term Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status Academic Intervention Services (AIS). A teacher, specifically assigned for this purpose, will instruct Extension of Services students in small groups. AIS teacher will focus on reading and writing strategies as well as test preparation to ensure that Long Term ELLs meet the standards. Lessons are provided at different lexicon levels, multi-tiered and address the areas of listening, speaking, reading and writing. Formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments created by teachers are given monthly and data is analyzed to inform continuous instructional planning as needed for all ENL students at all levels. Teacher confer with students every week to collect notes on progress related to the four modalities of Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing. Lessons are provided with different modalities with the use of technology and leveled software. Areas of need are identified and improvement cycles are put into place with various programs, which are analyzed quarterly for effectiveness and growth Lessons are provided at different lexicon levels, multi-tiered and address the areas of listening, speaking, reading and writing. Formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments created by teachers are given monthly and data is analyzed to inform continuous instructional planning as needed for all ENL students at all levels. A teacher who has been assigned to work with “newcomers” provides instruction that helps these students acquaint themselves to American life and orient them to American culture, their new community, and school routines/expectations. Data indicates that the ELL population can significantly benefit from vocabulary instruction. This program will be primarily used with TR & EX students. ELLs with IEPs will receive all above services and will be serve according to their IEP mandates. Although we do not have a large population of SIFE students, a SIFE libraries have been purchased to be used with SIFE students Professional development on how to better serve this population is also being implemented. 9  ELLs in US schools less than three years, follow a modified ELA curriculum based on reader's and writer's workshop. There is a strong focus the stages of grammar and stages of word knowledge. There is a focus on verb tenses and verb forms. Students are early readers and receive a classroom library for their readability level. ELLs receiving service 4 to 6 years are immersed in a more rigorous reading and writing workshop which is aligned to the English Language Arts Curriculum. The is a focus still on language development and reading and writing. These students are immersed with a rich classroom library and are expected to raise their level of reading and writing volume. Long Term ELLs received an English Language Arts Curriculum. There is a focus of paired reading and writing partnerships. ELLs with special needs follow the recommendations on the IEPs and the English Language Arts Curriculum. Students receive small group instruction from the SETSS teacher using a variety of strategies and intervention programs. Former ELLs for up to two years after testing commanding/proficient on the NYSESLAT receive .5 units of integrated ENL services with a certified ENL provider in ELA or content classrooms. They also receive ELL testing modifications on state exams for those two years. They receive time and a half, bilingual glossary or translated edition of the exam, an interpreter for low frequency languages if necessary, and a separate location. Describe differentiation of instruction for SIFE students within the program will occur as follows : SIFE Build supportive environments that respond to social, cultural, and linguistic needs of immigrant adolescents with limited schooling that include before and after school programs Implement Welcome classes to ease transitions for newly immigrated students Create collaborative Cohort models of instructional teams across academic departments to support simultaneous linguistic and academic development Implement flexible scheduling to address the needs presented by the student Increase modified instruction as well as delivery modalities with technology. Consider how standards and the curriculum can be adapted effectively Provide literacy/language instruction and teach adolescent readers the basics of five components of reading - phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension Increase student access to literacy-rich environments and print materials, and unifying language and content instruction Teach students learning strategies that they can use in the future. Strategies Use graphic organizers to illicit learning and prior knowledge such as word associations, word splash relationships, KWL charts, and anticipation guides. Provide a print rich environment with maps, charts, signs, posters with motivational phrases, and family words. Provide students with leveled “my choice” texts that are written for a lower reading level, high interest, low ability books, native language materials, and bilingual glossaries. Engage students in interactive muti tired learning Immerse students to drama, Technology, Multiple entry points with a Smart board, and manipulatives. Immerse student with new academic vocabulary Introduce frequent checks when assessing understanding. Allow students to learn in cooperative groups. 6. What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic content areas and accelerate English language development? 0  Our focus will also extend to activities to promote cultural awareness and to share best practices. We will also continue to provide our teachers with outside professional development as it becomes available. • Smartboard technology IPADs Laptops Cooperative Learning • ESL/ELA standards • Adapting Content Area • Incorporating graphic organizers • Portfolio assessment • NYSESLAT • ESL strategies • Classroom Management, • Content Based Instruction/ Sheltered instruction method • Overview of Second Language learning theory; BICS, CALP Comprehensible Input • Scaffolding • Graphic organizers • Think aloud • Social Cultural theory • Addressing the needs of English language Learners with disabilities • Team teaching strategies • Vocabulary PD Accountable talk Text based readings Close Reading Native Language Libraries Word to word glossaries by native language All listed materials are used with all students of JHS 227 including ELL-SWDs We additionally provide staff members with inter-visitations as well as lunch and learns. Training will also take place during weekly professional development sessions. Additionally the DELLSS has resources available on the website. The DELLSS do provide PD to the ENL coordinators that is utilized at JHS 227. Teachers are trained in ESL methodologies and strategies. In addition PD has been incorporated throughout the year to support the general education content area teachers. All teachers receive 15% their professional development in lanugage acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for ELLS. ENL teachers receive 50% of the latter. Records are maintained by using a sign in sheet. 7. How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? ELLs with special needs follow the recommendations on the IEPs and the English Language Arts Curriculum. ELLs with IEPs will receive all above services and will be served according to their IEP mandates. ELLs with IEPs will receive all above services and will be serve according to their IEP mandates. Students are immersed with a rich classroom library and are expected to raise their level of reading and writing volume. Academic Intervention Services (AIS) are provided to meet the needs of all students who require additional assistance to meet the NY State standards in ELA. Each grade has 4 programmed additional AIS services to support ELA and Math for all students, including students with disabilities and English Language Learners. Former ELLs are included in AIS services. To meet goals if needed students will benefit from a flexible schedule in which the student can visit a class based on presented target and assessed needs. Flexibility is used in scheduling to: Provide literacy/language instruction and teach adolescent readers the basics of five components of reading - phonemic 1  awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension Increase student access to literacy-rich environments and print materials, and unifying language and content instruction Increase student access to literacy-rich environments and print materials, and unifying language and content instruction Provide students with leveled “my choice” texts that are written for a lower reading level, high interest, low ability books, native language materials, and bilingual glossaries. Allow students to learn in cooperative groups. 8. Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups targeted). List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which they are offered. Targeted intervention for ELL students in the content areas includes instruction using ELL methodologies which practices immersion of vocabulary. Students are immersed in academic vocabulary building. Students also receive reading and writing in their content areas. The use of technology in the content areas also aids in the four modalities of reading, writing, speaking, and listening. JHS 227 continuously uses a data-driven approach to improve student performance. By using item analysis, portfolio assessment, and other indicators we identify and address student weaknesses and target areas for growth on an on-going basis. The Assistant Principal and the ENL coordinator use the RLAT, RMSR and the RNMR on ATS from the NYSESLAT to program the ELLs according to level. This data is also used by teachers to plan instruction. For those students that do not have a NYSESLAT, score the NYSITELL score (data) is used. Academic Intervention Services (AIS) are provided to meet the needs of all students who require additional assistance to meet the NY State standards in ELA. Each grade has 4 programmed additional AIS services to support ELA and Math for all students .Although the intensity of the services provided vary, based on the individual needs of students, all grade 6-8 students performing in Levels 1 and 2 and all students deemed to be at risk, including students with disabilities and English Language Learners, will receive appropriately targeted services. Former ELLs are included in AIS services on of the following AIS services ; Jamestown Reading Navigator, Read 180 ,SRA, AMP, River Deep , and Focus on Literacy. In order to target the needs of ENL population, JHS 227 analyzes and interprets all assessments the NYSITELL, ELA tests scores, math scores and NYSESLAT scores and NYSESLAT scores by modalities. We additionally note students’ years of ESL service, years in the United States, educational level in their country of origin and any other relevant information that may help teachers get a better snapshot of the student they are working with, (for example: student comes from Mexico, but does not speak Spanish.) In addition to the data gather by the above assessments, teacher’s conferencing notes are kept. All the results of the above indicated assessments are essential and used planning and implementing data driven, standards based, differentiated lessons using Tier I and Tier II interventions that are specific to the needs each student. Data is updated monthly for ELL students grades sixth (6) to eight (8). Additionally, the use of bilingual glossaries assist in all classrooms containing ENL students. Entering classes use Keystone- Keys to Learning EM, TR, EX, CM levels remain in a blended general education environment for content areas. The ESL component of the mixed class is proficiency based. Students receive instruction in English with a focus on vocabulary. Teachers are trained in ESL methodologies and strategies. In addition PD has been incorporated throughout the year to support the general education content area teachers. All teachers receive 15% their professional development in lanugage acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for ELLS. ENL teachers receive 50% of the latter. Records are maintained by using a sign in sheet. Students participate in the ELA, Math and other content areas of instruction with non ELL students. Ell students in stand-alone settings are taught using the Shining Star Program, which is aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. This is a three-level English language learning program based on the systematic development of skills and strategies. The program comes with a students workbook, an annotated teacher’s edition, an audio program, an assessment guide, resources for teachers, resources for students, transparencies, videos and student cd-rom.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's Regulation A-663). By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). Part A: Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 1. Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)  Automate The System (ATS) reports  Student Emergency Contact cards  Surveys conducted by your school. Approximately 1/4 of our students are English Language Learners. Indicators that have been used to assess our school’s written and oral interpretation needs are through observation of parents that need assistance when registering their child, parental visits for parent conference with teachers, guidance or administrators. Other observations have been noticed during PTA meetings or other events where parents were invited to the school. 01  Also, the school determines the primary language of parents as follows; parents are given the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS), where they indicate their language preference. Additionally parents receive the Parent’s Preferred Language Form. The school will access the RCPL ATS report on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with Chancellor’s Regulation A-663. All information will be transferred to a database where information can be properly accounted for and printed for use of main office to better direct and assist parents. Parents indicate in what language and how they would like to communicate with school. Both forms are filed in students cumulative folders. Additionally, information is recorded in students Emergency Contact Card. In order to meet the needs of the parents we use translated materials (brochures, online videos) provided by the Office of ELL's and services offered by the Translation and interpretation Unit, including document translation and on-site interpretation services. JHS 227 is extremely lucky to have a wealth of on site Bilingual personnel, Principal, AP's, teachers, paraprofessionals and guidance counselor, assist with the communication with the parents. With these procedures and resources we have been able to assess our school's written translation and oral interpretation needs thus ensuring that all parents are provided with appropriate and timely information in a language that they can understand. 2. List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, which are represented in your school community.
