N/A 4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated. Program Name Fund Source (i.e. Federal, State or Local) Funding Amount Indicate the amount contributed to Schoolwide pool. (Refer to Galaxy for school allocation amounts) Place an (X) in Column A below to verify that the school has met the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated. Indicate in Column B, section references where a related program activity has been described in this plan. Column A Column B Verify with an (X) Section Reference(s) Title I Part A (Basic) Title II, Part A Title III, Part A Title III, Immigrant Tax Levy (FSF) Federal Federal Federal Federal Local 0 0 0 $12,366 0 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 1Explanation/Background: Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students. 2  Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds. Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different sources when accounting for their use.  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended beneficiaries are met. 2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as follows:  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional program.  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language instruction programs.  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of English language acquisition and content area achievement. Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education designed to meet their individual needs.   Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application. 3  4  Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC) (Required for All Title I Schools) Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy. Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. Recruitment, retention, assignments and support that ensures staff is highly qualified demand a direct correlation between the schools’ working conditions for the teachers and its educational quality. Teachers’ quality of life within schools is the most critical yet more frequently overlooked ingredient in education reform. Many institutions do not even offer the basic amenities of a locked closet for teachers’ personal; belongings and working tools for their professional development. New teachers entering the system are typically assigned to the most disadvantaged schools and placed in the most challenging conditions with the neediest students. Mentoring and institutional support are seldom part of the equation. At the HS for Medical Science, administrators and supervisors encourage self-reflection and collegiality by fostering a new enthusiasm about teaching and a growing respect for the profession. Teachers participate of weekly grade level meetings, share a school wide common planning time during the day, and experienced teachers function as lead teachers. We have a New Teachers Mentoring Committee providing assistance, guidance, and support to all first year teachers. The committee is made up of our UFT Chapter Leader, Principal, Assistant Principals, Lead Teachers, Model Teacher and Guidance Coordinator. All first year teachers are paired with a seasoned teacher acting as his/her mentor. 2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS). Professional Development of staff is at the heart of making the High School for Medical Science a learning community of professionals that are working to build capacity among staff stakeholders in an effort to improve outcomes for all students. PD activities are ongoing throughout the school day and the school year and can generally be divided into three types; off-site, in-house and on call. In house PD opportunities generally take the form of meetings during a universally assigned Professional Development period (7th for the 2016-2017 school year) such as the Professional Learning Team (PLT) which includes the entire UFT staff and meets every Wednesday, GRT or Grade Level Teams, which meet on Mondays to discuss common concerns, expectations and best practices amongst teachers of a particular grade, and CAT or Content Area Teams, which meet Thursdays to discuss departmental matters such as curricula content and unpacking of standards. In addition to these regular standard meetings, staff also partake of ‘specialty’ meetings such as IEP or Curriculum Planning as needed throughout the year. Teams follow standard protocols in meetings such as creating agendas, collecting sign sheets and rotating responsibilities to facilitate, gather data, set goals, and develop measurable strategies for improvement. PLT topics are set by the administrative staff 2  after reviewing cumulative Advance teacher rating data, internally produced teacher surveys and Citywide Instructional Expectations. PLT meetings have a different Danielson Framework for Teaching component focus every month employing differentiated practices to present material such as watching videos, reading selections, pair discussions and whole group presentations. Off-site and on-call professional development opportunities are generally provided by the NYCDOE or the Borough Field Support Centers. Examples of DOE PD include Advance trainings offered to administrators and teacher leaders at the city-wide level and webinars on testing or HR matters. The BFSC offers supports in trainings offered to specific parties such as Guidance Counselors and Paraprofessionals during citywide PD designated days and site visits by support Specialists. On call site visits generally take the form of staff presentations on matters such as writing IEP goals and Present Levels of Performance or to specifically work alongside teachers in developing plans, aligning CCLS tasks, developing effective performance tasks and so on. Examples of topics covered in PLT PD include; effective questioning, Depth of Knowledge, SMART goals, learning targets, instructional shifts to the common core, UDL, student engagement and assessment in instruction.

TA Coordination with the Regular Program Describe the planning, coordination and support of the TA program with the regular educational program (i.e., providing ELT, accelerated, high-quality curriculum, including applied learning; and minimize removing children from the regular classroom during regular school day). N / A Part 4: SWP Schools Only 4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only) Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early intervention services, etc.). N / A 4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to improve instruction. All staff embrace in periodic and thorough review of our School Report Cards, Progress Reports, Quality Review and Quality Review Self-Assessment documents, periodic assessments, and SKEDULA reports; as well as reviewing the results of our Inquiry Team action research, surveys, and school-based assessments. Data gathered from all those sources is used to foster an existing good practice of interdisciplinary dialogue and common planning between 3  teachers of different subjects. The interdisciplinary dialogue and common planning practices have a direct effect in the lesson planning and creation of formal and informal assessment pieces. On the other hand, the creation of a stronger data culture in the school is an ongoing process. This data culture facilitates continuous data analysis of student performance and progress to disaggregated ethnic groups, gender trends and socioeconomic influences to improve our services. Consequently, our school community focuses in making sure that all action plans consistently identify clear measurable targets, allocate responsibilities to named people and include specific time frames. We want to ensure that teachers give students consistently clear feedback, explaining what they have done well and how to improve their work further, especially when work is displayed. Several teams are in place and they meet regularly in both content teams and grade teams and engage in collaborative conversations about students whom they share. Teachers are at the beginning stages of giving feedback on instructional practices in order to improve student understanding. The school has a team that is focused on using an inquiry approach to strengthen curriculum and pedagogy, 4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated. Program Name Fund Source (i.e. Federal, State or Local) Funding Amount Indicate the amount contributed to Schoolwide pool. (Refer to Galaxy for school allocation amounts) Place an (X) in Column A below to verify that the school has met the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated. Indicate in Column B, section references where a related program activity has been described in this plan. Column A Verify with an (X) Column B Section Reference(s) Part 4b of Sections 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, and 5E. Part 4b of Sections 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D and 5E. Title I Part A (Basic) Federal Title II, Part A Title III, Part A Title III, Immigrant Federal Federal Federal Tax Levy (FSF) Local 333,056.00 0 0 0 2,854,101.00 X X 1Explanation/Background: Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 4  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students. Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds. Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different sources when accounting for their use.  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended beneficiaries are met. 2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as follows:  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional program.  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language instruction programs.  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of English language acquisition and content area achievement. Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 5   IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education designed to meet their individual needs.  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application. 6  Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC) (Required for All Title I Schools) Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy. Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. Parent Involvement Policy (PIP) Template Parent and Family Engagement Policy Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of parents and community in the school. 09X413, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. The High School for Medical Science will support parents and families of Title I students by: ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology; ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision making in support of the education of their children; ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor their child’s progress; ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in languages that parents can understand; 7  ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other members of the school community; The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school. In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills; ● maintain a Parent Coordinator to serve as a liaison between the school and families. The Parent Coordinator will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home; ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 8  ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed; ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee; ● supporting or hosting Family Day events; ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their children’s progress; ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school activities and student progress; ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand."

X267,57,Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.," The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of parents and the community in our school. Therefore, our school, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title 1, Part A f the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between our school and the families. In order to foster a more effective and inclusive school program, all stakeholders, particularly parents must be provided with varied points of access for communication with the school leaders and faculty. In order to facilitate fluid and continuous communication with parents, and increase parent involvement in school culture and management, the Bronx Latin school will create and update the school website complete with email links to all staff members, a twitter handle for social media contact, and use of the text messaging application Kinvolved to communicate with parents. This increase in the range of communication mechanisms with parent is expected to increase the number of parents monitoring student progress and attending parent teacher conferences and grade team meetings. Presently, the Bronx Latin school utilizes advisers as point persons for parent contact, often with advisers looping with students to ensure continuity of the relationship between parents and the school. Advisers are required to make weekly calls to families to inform them of school related activities and complete phone logs using Google Apps for Education. Advisers also serve as liaisons between families and the school. Bilingual advisers (Spanish) are assigned to students from families who speak languages other than English. The school also employs Datacation and Skedula/ Pupil Path to provide parents with direct access to student real time progress data, test scores and online access to teachers within the school. The success of the parent outreach framework is evident in the Framework for Great Schools Report, however it is an area where the school is looking for continued growth, and continued parent enrollment in online platforms like PupilPath. Our goal for the 2018-19 school year is to have at least 60% of parents at Bronx Latin enrolled on Pupil Path to regularly check student grades. Bronx Latin will also continue to implement Kinvolved with a goal to have correspondence with 80% of families a minimum of 6 times during the school year. Part 2 – Annual Goal Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. By June 2019, we will increase the amount of parent outreach and involvement in academic achievement as measured by a minimum of 70% of parents accessing the Pupil Portal (Datacation) to monitor student progress and to improve student attendance and credit accumulation. 0  Part 3a – Action Plan Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools element, including:  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional  development, and/or systems and structures needed to impact change.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. For retention, Bronx Latin implements distributive leadership, where all members feel they are important members of the school community and weigh in on important decision making. Leadership positions, such as grade team leader, teacher leader, and department leader, were created in an effort to retain highly qualified teachers. Teachers will be given a survey in February 2018 to let the principal know their Declaration of Intent, and whether or not they plan to stay. The principal will meet with teachers one on one to discuss their decisions. Bronx Latin works collaboratively with the Human Resources Department with New Visions (PSO) to make new hires each year. New Visions holds various job fairs where highly qualified teachers are screened and recruited to interview with their schools. Also, our school works collaboratively with the New York City Teaching Fellows to recruit and hire highly qualified teachers in hard to staff content areas such as math, science, and special education. A hiring committee, which consists of three teachers and an administrator, reviews resumes, schedules demo lessons, observes demo lessons conducted by the candidates, and conducts interviews. Each candidate is rated by each member of the hiring committee. Teachers attend a week of professional development sessions in August, before the school year begins. In addition, teachers attend several sessions of professional development throughout the school year, including topics such as Socratic Seminar (6 hours), Argumentative Writing (5 hours), Performance Tasks (10 hours), Danielson Rubric (5 hours), MOSL (2 hours), and Teacher Best Practices (5 hours). Teachers also attend professional development held by New Visions and New York City Department of Education. Teachers participate in professional development in their weekly grade team meetings as well when they participate in lesson studies. Our English and math teachers are part of the Gates Grant through New Visions (PSO), which provides them with additional professional development and support within their classrooms. The math department is observed weekly by Sarah Toguchi from New Visions (PSO) and then meets twice a month in department meetings for additional professional development and lesson studies. Our English department is supported by Caroline Suh from New Visions via observations and bi-monthly department meetings. At the beginning of the school year, teachers set three professional goals for themselves. One goal is based on the Danielson rubric, one goal is based on the Common Core Learning Standards, and lastly, one goal is based on data from state exam pass rates or course pass rates depending on the course(s). Teachers then reflect on their progress towards these goals three times throughout the year. The Danielson and Common Core Learning Standards goals guide their lesson studies and teacher inter-visitations. 8  Teachers are observed by peer teachers once a month and required to observe a peer teacher once a month as well. Teacher leaders conduct observations based on domains 2 and 3. The guidance counselors conduct observations on domains 2b and 2d as well. All of these observations are recorded through an online observation tracker that provides instantaneous feedback to teachers and submits the reports to the principal as well so that she is able to see the feedback as well. 2b.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students. Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds. Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different sources when accounting for their use.  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended beneficiaries are met. 2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as follows:  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional program.  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language instruction programs.  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of English language acquisition and content area achievement. Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 1  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education designed to meet their individual needs.   Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application. 2  Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC) (Required for All Title I Schools) Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy. Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. Parent and Family Engagement Policy Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of parents and community members in the school. Bronx Latin, in compliance with Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.

X273,57,Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.," The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of parents and the community in our school. Therefore, our school will create and implement a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between our school and the families. In order to foster a more effective and inclusive school program, all stakeholders, particularly parents, must be provided with varied points of access for communication with the school leaders and faculty. In order to facilitate fluid and continuous communication with parents, and increase parent involvement in school culture and management, FDAV will create and update the school website complete with email links to all staff members. This increase in the range of communication mechanisms with parents is expected to increase the number of parents monitoring student progress and attending parent teacher conferences. Presently, FDAV utilizes our Parent Coordinator as a point person for parent contact. Our Parent Coordinator also serves as liaison between families and the school. Strengths: ● The school leader makes it a school wide priority for all students and their families to be aware of the school-wide expectations and plan pertaining to graduating from school and provides age appropriate information about high school to students and their families. ● The school staff uses a plan to communicate with parents (i.e., class dojo, skedula, phone-conferences, and communicating in a variety of ways) concerning student progress, achievement, and needs. ● The entire school community ensures that student data is shared in a way that families can understand their child’s learning needs and successes, proactively advocate for their children, and partner with the school to provide appropriate student support. Priority Needs:  The PA and SLT have been re-established, but attendance is low.  We have low turn out for parent workshops  Ways outside of phone calls home that will communicate with parents about positive or challenging behaviors, grades, upcoming events etc.  Need more parents' email addresses and to register for Skedula 5  Our data states that 80% of parents say that school staff regularly communicate with them about how parents can help their child learn. We will therefore have a priority subgroup as our SWD and ENL students as these students often need more and different needs to access the curriculum. Part 2 – Annual Goal Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. By June 2019 , all staff members will develop a parent outreach system in order to increase parent engagement as measured by a 10% increase in active parent accounts on our school-wide grading system, Skedula as well as attendance at parent-teacher conferences and parent workshops. 6  Part 3a – Action Plan Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools element, including: Target Group(s) Who will be targeted? Timeline What is the start and end date? Key Personnel Who is responsible for implementing and overseeing the activity/strategy?  Evidence-based instructional programs,  professional development, and/or systems and structures needed to impact change. Strategies to address the needs of students with disabilities, English language learners, and other high-need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, SIFE, STH). Professional Development training to the staff on how to actively seek and sustain partnerships with families and community organizations that are linked to the school’s plan for engaging parents to support student success FDAV will host a “Meet the Teacher” event in which families will be invited to attend in class presentations introducing them to their child’s Teachers and introducing the course expectations and requirements for passing. Parents will receive a Parent version of the School Handbook in English or Spanish complete with an itemized calendar of school events for the school year and a list of teacher email addresses. Parents and other stakeholders will be fully apprised of the events occurring at FDAV, including Parent Teacher Conferences, and Student Orientation by phone calls from the Parent Coordinator, Department Coordinators, and the family worker, letters mailed home and through visiting our new website during the course of the academic year. We have created a user friendly website navigation system with our calendar and other pertinent information. In order to help parents better comprehend their students' IEPs, workshops for parents will be developed in collaboration with the teachers, guidance department, PA and administration to read and understand the supports outlined in the students' IEPs as well as better understand their children's disability and ways to support them at home.

To be eligible for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

These avenues have included increased methods of systematic communication, providing grade team time for parent involvement, and PTA meetings highlighted with student celebrations. Increased Systematic Communication: ● In August parents of incoming freshmen and new students are invited to attend an extensive information session. At this time parents are introduced to Brooklyn Prep. Expectations are conveyed about our four year graduation plan 5  that will help them to become productive members of society. We convey to parents our instructional goals of 80+ in Math and Science exams, our Habits of Mind and Work, our portfolio process, and our expectation community service involvement. Parents ask questions about the tone of the schools, exams, and other pertinent concerns they might have. During freshman and newcomer orientation, parents are introduced to their child’s advisor and the advisory process in small groups. Parents of our IEP students are introduced to the Special education team and the ELL teachers. The diversity of our teachers has expanded to meet the changing needs of our school population. ● During September and October, there was a push to gain every email from parents. The school obtained 75% of parent emails. Every month there monthly calendars are sent to all parents. Our Dean of Student Services sends out weekly emails to parents informing them about opportunities provided to students. Emails are sent as necessary from Parent Coordinator. Parents email back the Parent Coordinator about events coming up in the school frequently. ● Daily automatic calls are made to students who arrive to school after 8:20. ● The guidance counselors reach out to parents and host two parents each week to support students: Who are academically struggling, who need support with financial aid, or who are in need of emotional development support. Grade Team Time: ● Professional development and grade team used by advisors to build and further relationships with the parents of their advisees, the goal is that advisors communicate with all parents on a monthly basis. ● Professional Development allows bi-monthly release time for teachers to call parents for positive anecdotals about their children. ● Grade Teams are given release time to update our online grading system, Skedula, so that parents can be informed of how their children are doing at the moment. PTA Meetings: ● Based on a survey completed by the parents last year, PTA meeting are held focusing on the specific needs of our parents. Parent interest surveys showed interest in bullying and cyber-bullying, internet and social network safety, understanding the Common Core, financial aid and scholarship 101, navigating the DOE, college and career success, as well as family financing resources. Other suggested activities and events include family museum visits and movie nights. ● So far, we have had sessions to: Introduced portfolio, celebrate Honor Roll students, convey our community service opportunities, provide information about financial aid, and host family game night. ● BPHS hosts a celebratory information session for parents of AP students to convey expectations of the course and for parents to meet Advance Placement teachers. ‘"

Q173,57,Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.," Only when parents are “educated” and informed by schools will they be able to assist their children. In that vein, we actively seek the participation of our parents at PTA meetings where we do the vast majority of our sharing and community outreach. From the Parent Coordinator’s feedback, we surfaced the need for more workshops touching on learning across the grades as well as workshops that provide social and emotional wellness such as a dancing and singing session, a yoga and/or exercise class. In order to increase parental involvement we will survey parents about the time and topics of interest that best suit them. Additionally, we will involve Staff members and students at PTA meetings. We use notices, our school website, and messenger to notify parents of school events. We are noticing that some of the contact information we have isn't updated. We therefore will be collecting updated contact information so that parents can be notified on messenger using the call system. We will also be collecting parents' cell phone numbers so that they can be contacted via text message since some families prefer that type of communication.

Not applicable 4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated. Program Name Fund Source (i.e. Federal, State or Local) Funding Amount Indicate the amount contributed to Schoolwide pool. (Refer to Galaxy for school allocation amounts) Place an (X) in Column A below to verify that the school has met the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated. Indicate in Column B, section references where a related program activity has been described in this plan. Column A Column B Verify with an (X) Section Reference(s) Title I Part A (Basic) Title II, Part A Title III, Part A Title III, Immigrant Tax Levy (FSF) Federal Federal Federal Federal Local 1Explanation/Background: Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students. 0  Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds. Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different sources when accounting for their use.  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended beneficiaries are met. 2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as follows:  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional program.  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language instruction programs.  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of English language acquisition and content area achievement. Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education designed to meet their individual needs.   Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application. 1  Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC) (Required for All Title I Schools) Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy. Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.
