What kind of people do we want them to be after their three years? These questions must be answered as an ideal. It is understood that this ideal will not likely be attained; yet it is essential that we maintain it as a vision. Here, then, is what we would like The Computer School to produce: A student who routinely and purposefully reflects upon his/her work This means that we must provide all students with the means to develop meaningful projects, the latitude to err and correct, the time to edit and revise, the atmosphere to plan and ruminate, and the support to critique and accept criticism. A student who can enter high school with a sense that school is not only a place where he/she is helped to prepare for the real world of work and self-fulfillment, but is itself part of the real world. This means that we must provide a curriculum that recognizes and is informed by the interrelationship of several disciplines, and hence rejects the artificiality of subjects in isolation. We must afford all students the opportunity to work collaboratively while allowing for different styles and speeds of learning. Further, it means that we must develop as part of the curriculum a program in which all students are exposed to theater, museums, business, government, environmental sites, and other cultural institutions and community resources. A student with a growing understanding of his/her place and significance both in today’s society and the continuum of history, who is developing a heightened sense of the interdependence of the various forces of history, and who demonstrates a healthy respect for the world’s diverse cultures…. hence, a child who reflects the understanding and responsibility that would enable him/her to see him/herself as a valued, productive, and compassionate member of society. This means that not only must we provide all students with a solid historical background but also encourage them to become active participants in their community as they also actively participate in their own education. It means that we reject the patchwork, superficially layered-on, so-called multicultural approach to the social studies in favor of one in which the world’s collective cultures are in all senses genuinely integrated. As such, the individual student becomes truly multicultural. A student who is an active learner and who develops a real spirit of inquiry; a student who is a problem solver. This means that our purpose must not be to give information or facts or answers, but to provide the means, the setting, and the tools which will enable our students to not just seek “the answer” but to search for the right questions to pose and to confidently ask these questions in a perpetual exploration. It means that we open our students to new and diverse experiences; that we provide them with opportunities to produce authentic work, germane to and stemming from their own interests. A student who is on his/her way to becoming technologically aware; one who will understand, or at least begin to comfortably utilize, the power of the computer and related technology and be able to access information and resources through a variety of electronic media such that he/she can thrive academically and vocationally in the world of the 21 st century. This means that we must provide students with an environment in which computers are readily accessible and are thoroughly integrated into all phases of school life. It means that lessons must be designed to allow for different groups of students each to be engaged in different tasks simultaneously. 0  A well-rounded child who is able to express himself coherently and lucidly in a variety of modes. This means that while we cannot hope to be comprehensive in terms of topics covered, we must provide a full curricular range including the arts—as well as the sciences and humanities—which are not presented in some enrichment fashion, but rather are seen in a fully integrated sense as part of a complete education. Further, it means that writing must be a part of all subject areas. It also means that opportunities in sports must be offered to all students. 2."

We endeavor to support the growth of all community stakeholders on their journey as learners as they strive to reach their highest potential. To address these priorities, our school community has articulated an instructional focus which embeds tiered questioning and discussion techniques in our design of coherent instruction, supported by the analysis of qualitative and quantitative data, using multiple points of access and literacy based cross curricula planning to foster greater student engagement. To accomplish these goals, we have crafted and articulated a course for improvement, a theory of action, which explains the specific changes we intend to make as a community in order to improve teaching and learning – “If we embed tiered questioning and discussion techniques in our design of coherent instruction, supported by the analysis of qualitative and quantitative data then we would have laid the foundation to foster greater student engagement”. To ensure compliance and adherence to high expectations we have established a set of “best practices”: 1-Students' celebration boards must be updated twice a month with authentic student work, rubrics, and next steps, 2-Homework must be given to students every day and must be referenced in lesson plans, 3-Class schedules must be posted in front of the classroom using students’ preferred mode of communication with their picture, 4-Vocabulary must be relevant to instruction and related to the content of the lesson, 5-Classroom rules and charters, Mood meter, and TEAM matrix, must be posted in the classroom and referenced throughout the instructional day to cultivate a culture of respect and collaboration, 6-Instructional planning must be standards based, reference skills students need to learn in order to achieve their IEP gaols, clearly delineated teaching points and objectives, opportunities for data collection, include how PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention Supports ) will be utilized and instructional resources such as curriculum maps, Mathletics, Flocabulary, Rethink curricular framework and Attainment, and 7-Assessment Policy that includes ongoing assessment throughout instructional activities, participation in self-reflective assessments at the end of all lesson, and feedback for next steps pertaining to student work. During the 2018-19 school year, our school instructional focus will continue to strengthen student achievement in a departmentalized setting, where students have the opportunity to participate in standard-based instruction aligned to the Dynamic Learning Maps Blueprints for ELA, Math, and Science, the NYS Learning Standards for Social Studies, the NYS Career Development and Occupational Studies Standards (CDOS), the New and Home Language Arts Progressions (Bilingual Common Core Initiative from Engage NY), the SANDI/FAST skills inventories, and the PBIS program. In addition, the revised P79M Curriculum Maps for ELA, Math, Science, and Social Studies will continue to serve as planning tools for examining, organizing, and implementing standard based instruction. These maps are an in-depth view of concepts and related skills students should know and be able to do in ELA, Math, Science, and Social Studies over the course of a school year. These maps also serve as tools for gathering data related to strategies employed and assessments used in each content area . Included in the maps is a scope and sequence to guide teachers about the depth, breadth, and order content should be taught for optimal learning. 2."

K309,0,What is your school’s mission statement?," P.S. 309 Mission Statment Section 4: CEP Overview P.S. 309K, The George E. Wibecan Preparatory Academy, is committed to making manifest in all our thoughts, words, and actions a spirit of collaboration, cooperation, and cohesion. We are committed to providing a student centered, upwardly mobile, education to all of our learners; facilitated by a knowledgeable, diverse, professional teaching staff; so that every child can go as far as their potential takes them. We are committed to collaborating with families and the local community to cultivate downwardly stable practices that will produce thoughtful   scholars whose world views are grounded in family, community and identity. We are committed to delivering a rigorous, standards based, cross-curricular education, through S.T.E.A.M, that is tailored and communicates high expectations for all learners, across all disciplines. We are committed to delivering a comprehensive social-emotional learning curriculum that grows the whole child, advancing citizenship, character development, and self-advocacy. We are committed to creating an outwardly global, culturally mediated, school environment that celebrates all the talents and skills that come through our doors, so that every learner may know and enjoy an ever expanding horizon of ambition and possibilities. Mission statement Explanation: At P.S. 309, we agree with Brown University’s Educational Alliance that “Culture is central to learning. It plays a role not only in communicating and receiving information, but also in shaping the thinking process of groups and individuals. A pedagogy that acknowledges, responds to, and celebrates fundamental cultures offers full, equitable access to education for students from all cultures.” As a result, we have revised our school’s mission to reflect those Culturally Relevant Educational (CRE) practices that research shows to be essential in the production and delivery of wholesome educational opportunities which will produce turn of the century, world class scholars. Our mission statement begins with an emphasizes on student centered learning within a collaborative, cooperative, and cohesive environment because research not only shows that children learn best when interacting with both adults and their more knowledgeable peers; but such an environment gives them opportunities to hypothesize, experiment with new ideas, and receive feedback in real-time; which ultimately leads to the development of self-confident, self-directed, proactive scholars and community leaders. Additionally, our mission statement places a premium on diversity and culturally mediated instruction, which helps our students to integrate diverse ways of knowing, understanding, and representing information. This skill not only allows them to become active participants in their own learning, it makes them stronger competitors in the global market place because they learn to develop insight and perspective, and share information in different ways. Also, our mission statement indicates that we seek to establish and maintain closer family and community ties. Whether through informal chats as parents brings their children to school, or in phone conversation or home visits, or through newsletters sent home, our school’s mission makes forging stronger family and community ties a top priority because research shows that these critically important partnerships results in better scholastic achievement for all students. Similarly, our focus on creating an environment in which students can learn about themselves and the world around them within a positive cultural context is important because it reduce ‘psychic alienation,’ which research shows can interfere with emotional and cognitive development, and result in academic engagement and attendance patterns predictive of school failure. Moreover, reshaping our curriculum to present our students with an interdisciplinary approach to education through S.T.E.A.M empowers them to assume leadership roles in the school and their local communities, which research shows to be a predictor of school success. Reshaping our curriculum signals to our students and their families that the education they are receiving is meaningful for this century and beyond because they are invited to make use of their own identity, experiences, and varied technical know-how to generate the innovations they need to achieve and preserve their comforts and happiness. Lastly, our mission focuses on messaging to all students the expectation that they will attain high standards in their school work because research shows this helps young learners develop a healthy self-concept and the intrinsic motivation need for them to demonstrate mastery of their grade level curriculum. When high expectations are peered with caring, culturally responsive teaching, the connection between culturally/community-based knowledge to classroom learning experiences is made more fluidic and dynamic; facilitating the transfer of what is learned in school to real-life situations. This conveys that school is important and necessary. 0  2."

With only two classes at each grade level, we provide our children with a caring and intimate learning environment. At Arts & Letters we believe that the purpose of public education is to work in partnership with parents and communities to raise young people who are strong and flexible thinkers, connected to their individual culture and heritage and caring, responsible stewards and leaders of a vibrant, democratic society.   In the spirit of this purpose, we at Arts & Letters promise to cultivate joy, rigor, and meaning in each child's education; an education built on a belief that through a rich and challenging questioning of the world and ourselves, we can and will develop creative, confident, and courageous people who will make our world more just, enriched, and compassionate. Mission Statement A school is an articulation of a community's hopes and dreams for its children. In order to cultivate our young people into the powerful citizens our community needs, we must create and maintain a culture of excellence. Therefore, in order: To develop strong and flexible thinkers, our classrooms will be places where students pursue essential questions, big ideas, and the world's history, traditions, and discoveries. Alongside their classmates and teachers, they will explore great literature, big and small mathematical challenges, the disciplines and creative purposes of the arts, and exciting scientific ideas. Classrooms will be rich with purpose; the quality of the work built on feedback and revision. They will learn to read and read to learn, become curious and confident about problems, make specific observations, make sense of data and confidently handle numbers and calculations. They will develop a keen and critical eye to interpret what they see through multiple lenses. To help raise young people who are connected to their individual culture and heritage our school will continually develop curricula and create an environment that nurtures a sense of belonging in each child and family. We will provide opportunities for young people to learn about themselves and where they come from. Our classrooms and hallways will be filled with images, ideas, art and thinking from people who look like them and with whom they are connected. To develop the caring, responsible stewards and leaders that our community needs to nurture a vibrant democracy, our young people will have experiences that will allow them to learn from older and younger people, from those of other cultures and neighborhoods, and to spend time hearing one another out. Each project they complete individually and together will take time, require multiple drafts, feedback, and revision. Each piece of work will be celebrated and shared with others in our community. In our school, students will be asked to persevere in the face of difficulty, to celebrate success, and to learn from failure. They will be asked to listen carefully, to take a stand, to defend a new idea, and to take risks. To make our world just, enriched and compassionate, our young people must develop their compassion ""muscles,"" requiring the practices of respect for others, focused and quiet reflection, the search for understanding, and a commitment to responsibility for one's self and for others. In our classrooms, our students will undertake projects that connect our school with our community, and with our past. To create a community of adults – both teachers and family members – that helps develop such powerful young people, the adults must be willing to work together and share their practices with one another. Just as students need multiple experiences with success, failure, and revision, so too do the adults in our community. Schools and communities teach values intentionally and unintentionally; our adults must not only strive to model our values, but also the reflective ability to learn from challenges when they fall short. Throughout our nine years with each child and family, Arts & Letters is committed to cultivating young people who will fulfill these hopes. 0  2."

Teachers are also able to have extended time with students to thoroughly cover a concept. 3.

At the heart of all that we do at PS 9 are our core values: Vision, Opportunity, Independence, Collaboration, and Expression, or VOICE. VOICE is reflected in all instructional and social/emotional curricula, pedagogical models, and everyday interactions between and among students, staff, and families. It is VOICE   that has enabled all members of the PS 9 community to set purposeful goals and work together to achieve them. Our core values embody who we are now and will shape us as we grow. PS 9 is most proud of our work with Framework for Great Schools elements of supportive environment and rigorous instruction. PS 9 offers the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Horizons program (8:1:1), which offers intensive intervention to students on the Autism Spectrum who are experiencing a moderate degree of challenge with social, behavioral, and communication development. The students in these classes participate in the general education curriculum and are held to the same expectations as other students, and are making great strides to meet the CCLS. As a result of intense common planning, both on grade level and vertically, there is a high level of consistency and cohesion reflected in the environment and pedagogy in all classrooms. Best practices from Teachers College, Core Collaborative, Metamorphosis Math, and ASD professional development are shared amongst all classrooms. As a result, all students, no matter what their designation are engaged in rigorous instruction in a supportive environment. PS 9 is committed to building a strong collaborative community that celebrates the uniqueness and individuality of each child. Students learn values of a community including ideals around collaboration, cooperation and respect for diversity. Through rigorous instruction, students are independent thinkers and learners, have strong content knowledge, think critically, effectively problem-solve, and understand other perspectives and cultures. In order to create a supportive environment where all students can succeed, we have established a Child Study Team, composed of administration, related service providers, and teachers, which meets twice monthly to discuss students, their challenges, and develop response to intervention strategies. Through this structure, teachers and related service providers regularly collaborate and communicate about each child’s individual needs and personalized instructional strategies as well as their progress in academic, behavioral, and social areas.

Satellite Academy is a high school with 266 students from 9 through grade 12. 3. Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. As a transfer high school, the students at Satellite Academy are “over-aged and under-credited.” Most students come to our school have many personal and academic difficulties. We teach, but also rehabilitate young people who would otherwise drop out of school entirely. Therefore we work with a student population that is more challenging than student populations in traditional four year, articulated high schools. Because our students have generally come to us from schools where they felt that they were not given individual and caring attention, all students are in advisory classes, (family groups), which provide academic and personal support. The student body includes 3% English language learners and 16% special education students. These students need strategies to support their accessing higher level texts and higher order thinking skills. 4. Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. We progressed in two areas this academic school year, which were Collaborative Teaching and Rigorous Instruction. Teachers participated in lesson studies and inter-visitation cycles to further develop their rigorous instructional strategies. Teachers also participated in weekly PD sessions that focused on topics including literacy strategies. Teachers also participated in teaching learning communities where they received peer feedback on teacher created assignments through the lens of student work. We will continue this work in the coming school year. In addition, we will continue to specifically focus on increasing student attendance. We will have a team working on attendance, including a full-time attendance teacher. We will shared best practices for attendance during staff meetings and periodically check our attendance data as a staff. This expansion of staff members focusing on attendance will increase our ability to target attendance across the school and i n all classes. 0  School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 02M570 School Conf iguration (2018-19) Grade Configuration 09,10,11,12 Total Enrollment (2017-18) English Language Learner Programs (2018-19) 298 SIG Recipient (Y/N) Transitional Bilingual N/A Dual Language N/A Self-Contained English as a Second Language Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16) # Special Classes (ELA) # Special Classes (Math) # Visual Arts # Foreign Language % Title I Population % Free Lunch % Limited English Proficient 1 1 % American Indian or Alaska Native % Hispanic or Latino % White # SETSS (ELA) # SETSS (Math) Ty pes and Number of Special Classes (2018-19) # Music # Drama # CTE # Dance 101 50 # Integrated Collaborative Teaching (ELA) # Integrated Collaborative Teaching (Math) School Composition (2017-18) 74.0% % Attendance Rate 73.8% % Reduced Lunch 4.4% % Students with Disabilities Racial/Ethnic Origin (2017-18) % Black or African American 1.0% 57.7% % Asian or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander 2.7% % Multi-Racial Personnel (2015-16) Years Principal Assigned to School (2018-19) % of Teachers with No Valid Teaching Certificate % Teaching with Fewer Than 3 Years of Experience 0.6 0% 8% # of Assistant Principals (2016-17) % Teaching Out of Certification Average Teacher Absences (2014-15) Student Perf ormance f or Elementary and Middle Schools (2017-18) ELA Performance at levels 3 & 4 Science Performance at levels 3 & 4 (4th Grade) (2016-17) N/A N/A Mathematics Performance at levels 3 & 4 Science Performance at levels 3 & 4 (8th Grade) (2016-17) Student Perf ormance f or High Schools (2016-17) ELA Performance at levels 3 & 4 Global History Performance at levels 3 & 4 4 Year Graduation Rate Regents Diploma w/ Advanced Designation 56% 13% 13.7% 0.0% Mathematics Performance at levels 3 & 4 US History Performance at Levels 3 & 4 6 Year Graduation Rate (2011 Cohort) % ELA/Math Aspirational Performance Measures (2015-16) Ov erall NY SED Accountability Status (2018-19) Reward In Good Standing Focus District Priority School No Y es Y es No Recognition Local Assistance Plan Focus School Identified by a Focus District Focus Subgroups N/A Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) (YSH = Yes Safe Harbor) Elementary/Middle School Met Adequate Y early Progress (AY P) in ELA (2016-17) American Indian or Alaska Native Hispanic or Latino White Students with Disabilities Economically Disadvantaged American Indian or Alaska Native Hispanic or Latino White Students with Disabilities Economically Disadvantaged American Indian or Alaska Native Hispanic or Latino White Students with Disabilities Economically Disadvantaged American Indian or Alaska Native Hispanic or Latino White Students with Disabilities Economically Disadvantaged American Indian or Alaska Native Hispanic or Latino White Students with Disabilities Economically Disadvantaged American Indian or Alaska Native Hispanic or Latino White Students with Disabilities Economically Disadvantaged N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A Black or African American Asian or Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Island er Multi-Racial Limited English Proficient ALL STUDENTS Met Adequate Y early Progress (AY P) in Mathematics (2016-17) N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A Black or African American Asian or Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander Multi-Racial Limited English Proficient ALL STUDENTS Met Adequate Y early Progress (AY P) in Science (2016-17) N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A High School Black or African American Asian or Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander Multi-Racial Limited English Proficient ALL STUDENTS Met Adequate Y early Progress (AY P) in ELA (2016-17) N/A Y SH N/A N/A NO Black or African American Asian or Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander Multi-Racial Limited English Proficient ALL STUDENTS Met Adequate Y early Progress (AY P) in Mathematics (2016-17) Black or African American Asian or Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander Multi-Racial Limited English Proficient ALL STUDENTS N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A Met Adequate Y early Progress (AY P) in Graduation (2016-17) Black or African American Asian or Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander Multi-Racial Limited English Proficient ALL STUDENTS N/A NO N/A N/A NO No N/A 31 17 56.7% 0.0% 21.5% 38.3% 0.3% 1.0% 2 0% 7.4 N/A N/A 37% 6% 51.0% N/A N/A No No N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A NO N/A N/A N/A Y SH N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A NO N/A N/A N/A NO 1  Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? Indicate the data trends, source and year. Examining survey data from teacher experience with preparing students for summative assessments, teachers determined that an area of need continues to be to further develop students' literacy skills across all subject areas. 100% of teachers responded that student literacy skills need to be enhanced to facilitate student ability to complete assessment tasks at all levels more independently. Based on our diagnostic data, we determined that literacy skills were below grade level for over 95% of our student body. Part 2 – Annual Goal Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. This academic year, Departmental Inquiry Teams will focus on the implementation of aligned literacy speaking and listening strategies. Every lesson should have some opportunity for speaking and listening. Collaborative activities (group work) should be structured in a way that has each student speaking. Teachers will explicitly teach “active listening” skills and create many opportunities for students to practice this. Professional Development will focus on literacy skills and alignment across subject areas. We will continue to develop our teacher professional learning community by ensuring teachers have numerous opportunities to participate in peer feedback cycles and consultancy protocols on student/ instructional issues. Students will demonstrate improved literacy skills by June 2019 as determined by progress on literacy skills rubrics we develop, which align with New York Standards Consortium rubrics. We also anticipate seeing higher quality PBA presentations and increased literacy levels as measured by class performance assessments. 2  Part 3a – Action Plan Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools element, including:  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional  development, and/or systems and structures needed to impact change. Strategies to address the needs of students with disabilities, English language learners, and other high-need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, SIFE, STH). Target Group(s) Who will be targeted? Timeline What is the start and end date? Key Personnel Who is responsible for implementing and overseeing the activity/strategy? Staff developer and teachers will share and explore speaking and listening strategies to implement in classes. After implementing a teaching strategy, teachers will examine the impact of the strategy through protocols and make adjustments accordingly. Staff will participate in professional learning communities by sharing peer feedback on student work and instructional materials, participating in inter-visitation cycles, and by sharing best practices. Departmental teams will focus specific inquiry meetings solely to examine English language learners and students with disabilities. Through these meetings, teachers will identify strategies to implement and discuss student progress and any necessary instructional shifts to be made. Teachers will become more integrated into our work to support our student attendance by looking at attendance data and sharing best practices.

As a transfer high school, the students at Satellite Academy are “over-aged and under-credited.” Most students who come to our school have many personal and academic difficulties. We teach, but also rehabilitate young people who would otherwise drop out of school entirely. Therefore we work with a student population that is more challenging than student populations in traditional four year, articulated high schools. This is part of our mission. As part of our mission, we aim to develop our students' ability to advocate for themselves and feel empowered to enact their vision. This empowerment, we believe, will support student investment in their education and their desire to maintain a positive learning environment. Part 2 – Annual Goal Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. For the 2018-2019 academic year, SAHS will increase student voice through the implementation of a student leadership group that will gather student input and provide a platform where students can advocate and communicate their needs. This will help our school environment better represent our students' needs. We hope to see a 20% increase in student participation in school-wide initiatives. In addition, a circle model of discussion will be implemented in Family Group classes, in order to provide students more opportunity to connect, lead and advocate. We anticipate 100% of Family Groups facilitating the circle model o f discussion at least once a week. This strategy, which is derived from the Restorative Justice framework, has proven to support the development of a connected/ invested student culture. 5  Part 3a – Action Plan Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools element, including:  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional  development, and/or systems and structures needed to impact change.

Teams of teachers meet routinely to evaluate and adjust the school’s interim assessments, which are guided by the Consortium's PBA rubric. The staff developer and administration provide professional development regarding the use of assessment results to drive classroom instruction during our regular inquiry meetings. 4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes 1. To be eligible for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated 2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated. Program Name Fund Source (i.e. Federal, State or Local) Funding Amount Indicate the amount contributed to Schoolwide pool. (Refer to Galaxy for school allocation amounts) Place an (X) in Column A below to verify that the school has met the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated. Indicate in Column B, section references where a related program activity has been described in this plan. Column A Column B Verify with an (X) Section Reference(s) 2  Title I Part A (Basic) Title II, Part A Title III, Part A Title III, Immigrant Tax Levy (FSF) Federal Federal Federal Federal Local TBD 2018-2019 0 0 0 TBD2018-2019 X X 5B 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E 1Explanation/Background: Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students. Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it i s consolidating like they are a single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated School wide pool to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds . Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different sources when accounting for their use.  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended beneficiaries are met. 2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as follows:  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional program.  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high -3  quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language instruction programs.  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of English language acquisition and content area achievement. Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education designed to meet their individual needs.   Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application. 4  Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC) (Required for All Title I Schools) Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s pol icy. Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. Parent and Family Engagement Policy Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of parents and community in the school. Satellite Academy High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision -making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.

The school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school. In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input.

Through inquiry-based lessons, teachers provide students with opportunities to construct their knowledge and deepen their conceptual understanding across the curriculum. Inquiry allows students to fully participate in the process of asking questions, uncovering knowledge, and sharing what they have learned with others. Through sharing their learning, students participate in meaningful conversations that strengthen and develop their ability to communicate and collaborate with others. While students are actively involved in the process of inquiry in the classroom, inquiry is an ongoing process for our leaders, teachers, and families. We actively seek to learn more about our students and ourselves in order to ensure daily alignment with our core values and the fulfillment of our mission. Responsibility We believe that it is a great responsibility to provide our students and families with an enriching educational experience that leads to the development of active and engaged citizens. At Q300, we provide students with the support they need to play an active role in the learning process to facilitate their own success and the success of others. Our ultimate goal is to guide our students as they use their unique gifts and talents to improve their community. An essential step in supporting our students in becoming active citizens is engaging them in annual service learning projects. Through this process, students learn how individuals can work with others take action to improve their communities. 2."

The majority of our students have had their educational process interrupted due to a variety of issues that include but are not limited to anxiety, substance abuse, parenting, depression, incarceration, homelessness, domestic abuse and community violence. The mission of our school is grounded in Sankofa, a West African word that means, “We must go back and learn our past in order to know who we are today, thereby empowering ourselves to move forward.” Our students must be able to go back and analyze the factors, both external and internal, that caused them to make poor/uninformed choices. We work with students through their journey back and provide them with   the support and avenues to move forward. In moving forward, students acquire the awareness that there are consequences for their choices and a lot of the work with our students is making them understand that they do have choices in how they react to their current circumstances. Our teaching and counseling staff work together to provide an academically challenging and socially supportive environment to meet the needs of all of our students. These nurturing surroundings engage and thus enable students to succeed so that they may reach their goals. Our charge is not to educate and exile, but to educate and liberate.

As a result, VOYAGES South developed the Student Tracker initiative to create and communicate individual academic plans for each of our students. This initiative has several key components including the following: 1. Every student meets with counseling staff and our director of programming to formulate a plan of credit accumulation, ongoing scheduling of classes, and intended dates for NYS Regents exams and graduation. This plan is revisited following the end of each trimester. 2. The Student Tracker holds all transcript data and information from the programming meetings for each individual student and is an accessible running record of student work towards graduation. The student tracker is part of the VOYAGES South migration to online accessibility for all community members through the use of GOOGLE Education. 3.

Our strength in providing rigorous instruction is through continued development of school wide curriculum and instruction that aligns to NYS High School Standards while at the same time addressing the many academic needs of a transfer school population. VOYAGES South has implemented and created many of the systems and structures that are necessary for high academic expectations and goals. The following accomplishments highlight our strengths as we create instruction that is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core in every classroom : 1. Continued professional development for teaching staff on the CCLS and the use of Depth of Knowledge, Critical Thinking Skills, scaffolding and the use of data systems through the guidance of teacher led PD Teams. In addition, our third year will include a continued collaboration with the RE-Design group, providing extensive onsite coaching to our ELA department. This coaching will provide ongoing support as we develop an ELA curriculum that is skill based, 1  engaging, and differentiated for transfer high school students of varying reading levels. RE-Design will also be working with our math department. 2. Our Common Core Team has addressed the instructional shifts of the CCLS, focusing on best practices for increasing literacy across all subject areas. Our subject teacher teams have begun developing curriculum according to the CCLS instructional shifts, implementing common across the classroom strategies for increasing literacy skills.. 3. VOYAGES South teaching staff continues to develop rigorous lesson planning and through the Guided Learning Planning initiative, building classroom instruction on the principals of frequent checks for understanding, classroom discussion, student centered work, multiple entry points, differentiated and activity based approaches for students with below level academic skills. 4. Our school continues to respond to the needs of our students through the creation of a writing workshop class that assists struggling readers and writers and is focused on informational text and the CCLS. 5. Teaching staff continues to work on our Storefront Initiative that creates visually engaging, interactive, text rich classrooms that showcase student work and shared feedback strategies. 6. Teaching staff has developed several advanced classes as part of our college readiness initiative including an advanced literature class, 3D Math/Modeling Class, Advanced Algebra class, and Constuction/Sculpture project class. VOYAGES South continues to build a well-developed culture of support and understanding for our transfer students. Our strength is in the close collaboration our D.O.E. staff has with Queen’s community House. Each individual student is known to the adults of our school community through a shared and thoughtful approach. Staff continues to implement systems, sharing data to identify and respond to both student and family needs. Our strength is in providing an environment that allows our students to make the important decisions necessary to complete their high school education. VOYAGES South continues to encourage teacher collaboration through regularly scheduled peer Learning Walkthroughs, teacher led Professional Development. Our school collaborates through Google Drive to upload and share lessons, videos and other materials that can be used in the classroom and is shared with the entire school community. Teacher teams meet twice a week, continually contributing to the school community as they work on implementing the CCLS, analyzing student data, and developing instructional goals and initiatives. Voyages South continues to build strong family-community ties through various family workshops, community based service projects, resources for families, and an active PTA and SLT. Our school is a welcoming place for parents, whose additional support of our efforts is vital for the growth and success of our transfer students. Our challenges are inherent in the model of our school. Transfer students have been unsuccessful, at times after many attempts, in more traditional schools. Our population is academically challenging, with the majority assessed at far below grade level literacy requiring urgent interventions despite having to complete the rigorous and accelerated credit accumulation necessary for graduation. Our students and staff struggle with how to best set fair and reasonable expectations for learning, especially when aligning to NYS Standards. In addition to the numerous academic supports our students require, many of our transfer students must cope with social and emotional obstacles from incarceration, homelessness, and abuse to illness and having childcare needs of their own. Our population is also very transient in nature, with families continually uprooted and moving to areas that require tremendous travel time. Our location in South Queens in the August Martin Campus is a specific challenge with limited available public transportation, neglected facilities, and a building whose reputation is unfortunately negative when publicly expressed. Our ability to use technology is limited at best with a crumbling infrastructure, antiquated Internet access, and well documented neglect. In this our second year, we are limited in classroom space, having constantly shifting 2  rooms for teaching staff, while always adjusting to construction schedules that have closed bathrooms and gym space completely. Despite the many challenges our focus will be on the continued growth in the following areas: 1. Common sense, practical and school wide implementation and curriculum alignment of the CCLS in a transfer school setting. 2. Continue to create and establish overarching systems and understandings of how to support and sustain student social, emotional, developmental, and academic health. 3. Continue to promote teacher collaboration, identifying best practices and strategies for instructional planning. 4. Continue to develop specific and measurable (SMART) goals for a shared vision of student success at VOYAGES South Queens. The continued articulation of this vision coupled with the specific strategies for shared leadership and teacher development. 5. Continue to develop multiple tools for regular communication with students and families that promote high academic and social expectations for students. To further our school’s natural evolution to support both our student’s academic and social needs as well as the families that are a necessary part of success. 6. Create an environment of trust throughout our community through consistently high academic and social expectations. To develop trust through a caring community that collectively communicates our core values and encourages continued learning and college readiness. 2."

Educators create spaces for students and themselves to engage in the productive dialogue and understanding of opposing view so we can peacefully resolve conflict and create solutions by building on each others’ ideas. Through struggle and engaging with opposing view points, we become the fullest expression of ourselves. COURAGE – How do you exercise your power and how do you respond to your mistakes? We endeavor to have the courage to speak our minds, stand up for our beliefs, and do what is right, even when no one else will. Doing this does not mean that we are unafraid – it means doing so in spite of being afraid. Courage also means seeing failure as an opportunity to grow and learn – as a natural step on the continuum of success. We stand in our agency and, through our studies, build the skills and knowledge so that we may advocate thoughtfully and strategically. COMMUNITY – How do you support your community?

It is important to note that STEAM will also drive and develop student focused Literary Skills. Here are highlights of our mission and vision to meet our students’ learning needs: P4K Belief System of How Children Learn Best. ● P4K believes that children learn best by being immersed in a learning environment that is filled with opportunities for student Engagement, Exploration and Evaluation. We endeavor to establish this positive learning environment through Center - based Learning, Positive Behavior Support Program, and access to Standard - based Curricula and Assessments. We recognize and attempt to close the gap between what children can perform with adult guidance and what children can do independently. We believe that a wide variety of differentiated strategies such as scaffolding, visual/verbal/physical supports will nurture and promote the achievement of student IEPs, academic and behavioral goals and objectives. We have internalized the belief that all children will have an overall means of communication that is known and utilized throughout the school day. We believe that such an environment is conducive to student learning and independence as the focus puts ‘Children, First.’ (QR 1.2, 3.1, 3.4, 4;1; DR 1a, 1b,1e, 2b, 2c,3b,3c,3d; Six Elements of the Capacity Framework for Great Schools) 2."
